<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty-one first-degree relatives of type 2 diabetic subjects and 21 control subjects without a family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, who were matched for sex, age, BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, and aerobic capacity, underwent a hyperglycemic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> clamp (10 mmol/l, 180 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An OGTT (75 g <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in 300 ml water) was also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: First-phase insulin release (plasma insulin, 0-10 min) was not different (multiple analysis of variance [MANOVA]: F = 2.63, P = 0.11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Second-phase insulin release was lower (MANOVA: F = 4.18, P = 0.047) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Separate analyses of variance showed decreased plasma insulin levels from 120 min onward (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05), decreasing to geometric mean (95% CI) levels of 330 (270-402) and 462 (366-582) pmol/l at 180 min in relatives and control subjects, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The insulin sensitivity index (ISI) as assessed using a hyperglycemic clamp was not different between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean +/- SE ISI during the 3rd hour was 27.5 +/- 2.2 and 30.5 +/- 3.0 micrograms.kg-1.min-1.pmol-1.l-1 in relatives and control subjects, respectively (P &gt; 0.20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 90 min after the OGTT, log plasma insulin levels correlated significantly with second-phase insulin release as assessed using the hyperglycemic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-tolerant first-degree relatives of type 2 diabetic subjects have a decreased second-phase insulin release, compared with matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After an OGTT, 90-min values of log plasma insulin and 90-min values of the ratio of log plasma insulin to blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> may be good indicators of insulin secretory properties in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-tolerant family members of type 2 diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
