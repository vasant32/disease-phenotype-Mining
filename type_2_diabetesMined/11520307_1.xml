<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was carried out to determine the insulin sensitizing action of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="27698,35170">vanadium</z:chebi> using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi>-treated 3T3 adipocytes as an in-vitro model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fully differentiated 3T3 adipocytes were incubated with or without 100 nM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> in the presence or absence of 200 nM insulin for 6 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">Sodium</z:chebi> orthovanadate (0-1000 microM) was added on day 2 and was present during the last 4 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the end, insulin (100 nM) stimulated <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthesis was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Vanadate treatment for 4 days, caused 2-3-fold increase in <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthesis in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> treated adipocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 100 microM, vanadate completely reversed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (by increasing the levels from 9.65 +/- 0.80 to 28.4 +/- 4.9 nmol/h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In cells treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> and insulin, <z:chebi fb="11" ids="27698,35170">vanadium</z:chebi> was partially active and it caused only 30% increase in <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Exposure of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> treated cells for 24 h with <z:chebi fb="11" ids="27698,35170">vanadium</z:chebi> did not affect <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Under identical condition, <z:chebi fb="11" ids="27698,35170">vanadium</z:chebi> had no significant effect in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> insulin sensitive adipocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="11" ids="27698,35170">Vanadium</z:chebi> at 100 microM had no effect on 125I-insulin binding to insulin-resistant adipocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">Glycogen</z:chebi> synthesis in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and insulin-resistant adipocytes was stimulated by <z:chebi fb="32" ids="30145">lithium</z:chebi>, an inhibitor of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase kinase 3 beta, suggesting the involvement of phosphorylation events in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Since <z:chebi fb="11" ids="27698,35170">vanadium</z:chebi> was active only in the insulin-resistant adipocytes it is likely that <z:chebi fb="11" ids="27698,35170">vanadium</z:chebi> acts by relieving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> actions rather than having independent effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results provide evidence for the novel insulin sensitizing action of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="27698,35170">vanadium</z:chebi> which might be of future clinical relevance </plain></SENT>
