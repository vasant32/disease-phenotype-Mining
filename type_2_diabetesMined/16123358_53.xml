<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mfn2 encodes a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> protein that participates in the maintenance of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> network and that regulates <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> metabolism and intracellular signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The potential for regulation of human Mfn2 gene expression in vivo is largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction in insulin-resistant conditions, we have examined whether Mfn2 expression is dysregulated in skeletal muscle from <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> or nonobese type 2 diabetic subjects, whether muscle Mfn2 expression is regulated by body <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, and the potential regulatory role of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF)alpha or interleukin-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We show that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> concentration of Mfn2 is decreased in skeletal muscle from both male and female <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Muscle Mfn2 expression was also reduced in lean or in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a strong negative correlation between the Mfn2 expression and the BMI in nondiabetic and type 2 diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A positive correlation between the Mfn2 expression and the insulin sensitivity was also detected in nondiabetic and type 2 diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To determine the effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> on Mfn2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression, six morbidly <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects were subjected to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> by bilio-pancreatic diversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean expression of muscle Mfn2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> increased threefold after reduction in body weight, and a positive correlation between muscle Mfn2 expression and insulin sensitivity was again detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In vitro experiments revealed an inhibitory effect of TNFalpha or interleukin-6 on Mfn2 expression in cultured cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that body <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> upregulates the expression of Mfn2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in skeletal muscle of <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> humans, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> downregulates the expression of Mfn2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in skeletal muscle, Mfn2 expression in skeletal muscle is directly proportional to insulin sensitivity and is inversely proportional to the BMI, TNFalpha and interleukin-6 downregulate Mfn2 expression and may participate in the dysregulation of Mfn2 expression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and the in vivo modulation of Mfn2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels is an additional level of regulation for the control of muscle metabolism and could provide a molecular mechanism for alterations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> function in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
