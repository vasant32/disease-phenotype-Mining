<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The subject was a 26-year-old Japanese woman of 148 cm height, 96.2 kg of body weight (BW) (body mass index (BMI) of 43.8 kg/m(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>She was referred to our hospital on May 1, 2000 for the evaluation of marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> with clinical symptom of general malaise, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001959'>polydipsia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002919'>ketonuria</z:hpo> (3+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>She did not smoke, or drink alcohol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>But, she tended to eat lots of sweet food every day before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of this symptom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Her father was diagnosed type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Her fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and HbA(1c), and serum C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> were 398 mg/dl, 7.8% and less than 0.05 ng/ml [<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range: 0.94-2.8], respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>She tested negative for anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies and islet-cell antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> level in her urine was as low as 3.4 microg/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We immediately started insulin treatment under the diagnosis of abrupt <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001953'>diabetic ketoacidosis</z:hpo> on the day of her admission, and the insulin treatment was continued after her being discharged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>She showed continuous BW reduction until her BW reached approximately 60 kg, followed by her BW being plateau </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During the period, intra-abdominal visceral fat (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>) and subcutaneous fat (SF) volume assessed by helical computerized tomography (CT) showed a substantial reduction [3.9-0.5 l for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>, 19-3.2 l for SF volume] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Pre-<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> plasma <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> lipase (LPL) mass showed a considerably lower value when she had continuous BW reduction than did it when her BW reduction discontinued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that in this subject, continuous BW reduction after the abrupt <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is closely associated with intra-abdominal fat mass reduction, which may be related to decreased production of LPL </plain></SENT>
