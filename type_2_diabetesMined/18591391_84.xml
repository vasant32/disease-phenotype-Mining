<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Accumulating epidemiological evidence suggests that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1510471" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypovitaminosis</z:e> D may be associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and related metabolic risks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, prospective data using the biomarker serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] are limited and therefore examined in the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 524 randomly selected nondiabetic men and women, aged 40-69 years at baseline, with measurements for serum 25(OH)D and IGF-1 in the population-based Ely Study, had glycemic status (oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance), <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, insulin, anthropometry, and blood pressure measured and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> risk (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> z score) derived at baseline and at 10 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Age-adjusted baseline mean serum 25(OH)D was greater in men (64.5 nmol/l [95% CI 61.2-67.9]) than women (57.2 nmol/l [54.4,60.0]) and varied with season (highest late summer) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Baseline 25(OH)D was associated inversely with 10-year risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> (fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>: beta = -0.0023, P = 0.019; 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>: beta = -0.0097, P = 0.006), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (fasting insulin beta = -0.1467, P = 0.010; homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> [HOMA-IR]: beta = -0.0059, P = 0.005), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> z score (beta = -0.0016, P = 0.048) after adjustment for age, sex, smoking, BMI, season, and baseline value of each metabolic outcome variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Associations with 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, and HOMA-IR remained significant after further adjustment for IGF-1, parathyroid hormone, calcium, physical activity, and social class </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This prospective study reports inverse associations between baseline serum 25(OH)D and future glycemia and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These associations are potentially important in understanding the etiology of abnormal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism and warrant investigation in larger, specifically designed prospective studies and randomized controlled trials of supplementation </plain></SENT>
