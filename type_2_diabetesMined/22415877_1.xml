<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> levels 2 h after a standard 75-g <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> challenge are used to diagnose <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and are associated with both genetic and lifestyle factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, whether these factors interact to determine 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We meta-analyzed single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) × BMI and SNP × physical activity (PA) interaction regression models for five SNPs previously associated with 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels from up to 22 studies comprising 54,884 individuals without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PA levels were dichotomized, with individuals below the first quintile classified as inactive (20%) and the remainder as active (80%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BMI was considered a continuous trait </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inactive individuals had higher 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels than active individuals (β = 0.22 mmol/L [95% CI 0.13-0.31], P = 1.63 × 10(-6)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> SNPs were associated with 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (β = 0.06-0.12 mmol/allele, P ≤ 1.53 × 10(-7)), but no significant interactions were found with PA (P &gt; 0.18) or BMI (P ≥ 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this large study of gene-lifestyle interaction, we observed no interactions between genetic and lifestyle factors, both of which were associated with 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is perhaps unlikely that top loci from genome-wide association studies will exhibit strong subgroup-specific effects, and may not, therefore, make the best candidates for the study of interactions </plain></SENT>
