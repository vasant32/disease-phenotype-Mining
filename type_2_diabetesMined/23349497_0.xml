<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo> is a key condition in the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is well established that exacerbated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activity is involved in promoting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in peripheral insulin-target tissues; however, this involvement is less documented in pancreatic β-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using a transgenic mouse model, here we show that JNK activation in β-cells led to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> as a result of impaired capacity to increase insulinemia in response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pancreatic islets from these mice showed no obvious morphostructural abnormalities or decreased insulin content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, these islets failed to secrete insulin in response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> or insulin but were competent in succinate-, KIC-, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34795,48518">IBMX</z:chebi>-, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi>- and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27999">tolbutamide</z:chebi>-induced insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At molecular level, JNK activation in β-cells inhibited insulin-induced Akt phosphorylation, Pdx1 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and transcription of insulin-target genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> restored insulin secretion in response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> in mice and insulin-induced insulin secretion and signaling in isolated islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the mere activation of JNK suffices to induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in pancreatic β-cells by inhibition of insulin signaling in these cells, but it is not sufficient to elicit β-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, we provide the first evidence that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> exert insulin-sensitizing action directly on pancreatic β-cells </plain></SENT>
