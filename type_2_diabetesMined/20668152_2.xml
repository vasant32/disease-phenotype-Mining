<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This trial involved 50 patients randomly assigned to receive either conventional treatment alone or with additional follow-up through an IBGMS for 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients randomized to the intervention group uploaded blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> readings every 2 weeks to a secure Web site for review and receipt of feedback from their endocrinologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A1C and laboratory test results were collected at 0, 3, and 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The baseline parameters were not significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Over a 6-month follow-up, A1C dropped from 8.8 to 7.6% (P &lt; 0.001) in the intervention group compared with 8.5 to 8.4% (P = 0.51) in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The use of IBGMS significantly improved A1C levels in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treated with insulin </plain></SENT>
