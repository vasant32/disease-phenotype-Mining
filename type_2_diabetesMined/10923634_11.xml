<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intrapancreatic mechanisms are assumed to coordinate pulsatile insulin release, but small oscillations in plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations may contribute further </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To gain additional insight into beta-cell (patho)<z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp>, we explored the ability of repetitive small <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusions (6 mg/kg over 1 min every 10 min) to modify rapid pulsatile insulin secretion in 10 type 2 diabetic individuals (plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> 9.3 +/- 1.0 mmol/l, HbA1c 7.9 +/- 0.5%, mean +/- SE) and 10 healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects were investigated twice in randomly assigned order: during saline and during <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood was collected every minute for 90 min to create a plasma insulin concentration time-series for analysis using 3 complementary algorithms: namely, spectral analysis, autocorrelation analysis, and approximate entropy (ApEn) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During saline infusion, none of the algorithms were able to discriminate between diabetic and control subjects (P &gt; 0.20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> entrainment, spectral density peaks (SP) and autocorrelation coefficients (AC) increased significantly (P &lt; 0.001), and ApEn decreased (P &lt; 0.01), indicating more regular insulin time-series in the healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, no differences were observed in the diabetic individuals between the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and saline conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in spite of identical absolute <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excursions (approximately 0.3 mmol/l) <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> pulse entrainment led to a complete (SP: 4.76 +/- 0.62 [range 2.08-7.60] vs. 17.24 +/- 0.93 [11.70-20.58], P &lt; 0.001; AC: 0.01 +/- 0.05 [0.33-0.24] vs. 0.64 +/- 0.05 [0.35-0.83], P &lt; 0.001) or almost complete (ApEn: 1.59 +/- 0.02 [1.48-1.67] vs. 1.42 +/- 0.05 [1.26-1.74], P &lt; 0.005) separation of the insulin time-series in diabetic and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Even elevating the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion rate in the diabetic subjects to achieve comparable relative (and hence higher absolute) <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excursions (approximately 4.9%) failed to entrain pulsatile insulin secretion in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that failure to respond adequately with regular oscillatory insulin secretion to recurrent high-frequency and (near)-physiological <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excursion is a manifest feature of beta-cell malfunction in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Whether the model will be useful in unmasking subtle (possible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetic</z:e>) defects in beta-cell sensitivity to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> drive remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
