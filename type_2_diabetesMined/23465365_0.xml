<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that resolution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000704'>periodontitis</z:hpo>-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> by the therapy combined with antibiotics may have beneficial effects on the glycemic control of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 523 subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were screened for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031090" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodontal disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these, 160 subjects who visited dentists were divided into two groups according to high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hsCRP) level: &gt;500ng/ml and &lt;500ng/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The group with hsCRP over 500ng/ml was further sub-divided into two groups according to treatment strategy: topical application of antibiotics combined with conventional mechanical debridement (group A), and debridement alone (B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subjects with hsCRP below 500ng/ml were sub-divided similarly (C: combination therapy; D: debridement alone) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>hsCRP was measured after 1 month and changes of HbA1c after 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These parameters were also measured in control subjects (N=118) who did not visit dentists (E: initial hsCRP&gt;500ng/ml; F: hsCRP&lt;500ng/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A multiple comparison by ANOVA revealed that only group A showed a significant reduction in HbA1c over time (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariable analyses revealed elevated hsCRP and the combination treatment with antibiotics were two independent variables influencing the decrease of HbA1c over the study (P&lt;0.01 and P&lt;0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000704'>periodontitis</z:hpo>-induced mild <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> (hsCRP&gt;500ng/ml), treatment to reduce hsCRP using antibiotics is recommended </plain></SENT>
