<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have reduced EPC and increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>), which is reduced by multifactorial intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim, therefore, was to evaluate in type 2 diabetic patients whether the numbers of EPC derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells is influenced by a multifactorial treatment strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We enrolled 28 patients newly referred for initiation of multifactorial treatment, which consisted of improving glycaemic, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> and blood pressure control, as well as antithrombotic therapy and lifestyle modification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EPC count was assessed by in vitro cultures at baseline and after 90 days of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 7 days in culture, we identified EPC by fluorescent staining of attached cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, aspirin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> receptor blockers, and divided accordingly into groups of mono-, dual-, triple- or quadruple therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 90 days of treatment, glycaemic control improved and total cholesterol decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multifactorial intervention for 90 days significantly increased EPC count in cultures by 35% (from 105 [SE 8] to 140 [11] cells per field [p = 0.002]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The change in EPC among patients with quadruple therapy was higher (63%) than in untreated patients (-32%, p = 0.043) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Numbers of EPC derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells increased significantly after multifactorial intervention in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It remains to be shown whether these changes contribute to the beneficial effects of multifactorial intervention on diabetic micro- and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096293" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">macroangiopathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
