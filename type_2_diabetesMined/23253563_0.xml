<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Insulin initiation, adjustment of the insulin dose and the need for frequent assessment of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels are often complicated by patient and physician misconceptions and concerns regarding its use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For most patients requiring insulin therapy, dose titration is carried out by physicians; however, evidence suggests that this process may not provide optimal glycaemic management for patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Self-monitoring of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and self-adjustment of insulin dose (insulin self-titration) is well established in type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, suggesting that similar therapeutic self-management may be beneficial when applied to patients with T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This article reviews the rationale and clinical evidence for insulin self-titration in patients with T2DM with the aim of highlighting the importance of educating patients about insulin therapy and empowering them to manage their <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> through self-titration of insulin </plain></SENT>
