<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Contrast-enhanced transrectal colour Doppler ultrasound was performed using a microbubble-based ultrasound enhancer SonoVue for evaluating prostate vascularity (transitional zone [TZ] and peripheral zone [PZ]) in diabetic BPH patients, non-diabetic BPH patients and healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Computer-assisted quantification of colour pixel intensity (CPI) was used to objectively evaluate the prostate vascularity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Resistive index measurements were obtained in the TZ and the PZ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Findings were compared between these three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TZ-CPI was significantly lower in diabetic patients than in non-diabetic BPH men (p=0.001), whereas the CPI of the PZ showed no difference between these two groups (p=0.978) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TZ-CPI of patients with diabetic and non-diabetic BPH were significantly lower than in controls (p&lt;0.001), but no difference was found between diabetic and healthy patients in the PZ (p=0.022) and borderline significance was seen when comparing patients of the BPH group with the control patients (p=0.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Resistive index values of the TZ in diabetic patients showed significantly higher values (p&lt;0.001) than the BPH and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The significantly lower CPI and higher resistive index values of the TZ in diabetic patients compared with patients with non-diabetic BPH and healthy subjects indicate considerable vascular damage in the TZ of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Diabetic vascular damage may cause <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> and may contribute to the pathogenesis of BPH </plain></SENT>
