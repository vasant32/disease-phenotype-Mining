<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated 78 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning &gt;213 kb in 95 people, from which we selected 64 SNPs for evaluation in 191 Caucasian case subjects from Utah and between 165 and 188 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six SNPs showed nominal associations with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P = 0.001-0.04), including the nonsynonymous SNP rs1058405 (M67V) in exon 3 and rs11579627 in the 3' flanking region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only rs1159627 remained significant on permutation testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The associations were not replicated in 353 African-American case subjects and 182 control subjects, nor were ATF6 SNPs associated with altered insulin secretion or insulin sensitivity in nondiabetic Caucasian individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was found in a subset of 44 SNPs in Caucasian (n = 2,099), Pima Indian (n = 293), and Chinese (n = 287) samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Allelic expression imbalance was found in transformed lymphocyte cDNA for 3' untranslated region variants, thus suggesting cis-acting regulatory variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ATF6 does not appear to play a major role in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but further work is required to identify the cause of the allelic expression imbalance </plain></SENT>
