<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The enzyme glucokinase (GK) plays a central role in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hepatic GK activity is acutely controlled by the action of the GK regulatory protein (GKRP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In vitro evidence suggests that GKRP reversibly binds to GK and inhibits its activity; however, less is known about the in vivo function of GKRP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To further explore the physiological role of GKRP in vivo, we used an E1/E2a/E3-deficient adenoviral vector containing the cDNA encoding human GKRP (Av3hGKRP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>High fat diet-induced diabetic mice were administered Av3hGKRP or a control vector lacking a transgene (Av3Null) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, the Av3hGKRP-treated mice showed a significant improvement in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance and had lower fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels than Av3Null-treated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A coincident decrease in insulin levels indicated that the Av3hGKRP-treated mice had sharply improved insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These mice also exhibited lower leptin levels, <z:mp ids='MP_0001262'>reduced body weight</z:mp>, and decreased liver GK activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In vitro experiments indicated that GKRP was able to increase both GK protein and enzymatic activity levels, suggesting that another role for GKRP is to stabilize and/or protect GK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data are the first to indicate the ability of GKRP to treat type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and therefore have significant implications for future therapies of this disease </plain></SENT>
