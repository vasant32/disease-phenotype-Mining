<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study involved 34 patients (19 men, 15 women; mean age 46 +/- 13 years) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum ubiquitin values were measured by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay Measurement of nerve conduction velocity (NCV) was performed on three motor (median, tibial, and peroneal) and three sensory (median, ulnar, and sural) nerves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The value of motor compound muscle action potential (CMAP) was obtained from the sum of median, tibial, and peroneal motor nerve amplitudes, and sensory compound nerve action potential (CNAP) was computed as the sum of median and ulnar sensory nerve amplitudes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were divided into three groups: group 1 (n = 8) had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> electroneurography results, group 2 (n = 8) had slowed NCV, and group 3 (n = 18) had low values of motor CMAP and/or sensory CNAP as well as slowed NCV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean ubiquitin level in group 3 (20.4 +/- 2.9 ng/dl) was significantly higher than that in group 1 (11.2 +/- 1.1 ng/dl, t = 11.5, P &lt; 0.0001) and group 2 (13.2 +/- 2.7 ng/dl, t = 5.9, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum ubiquitin levels were inversely correlated with motor CMAP (r = -0.68) and sensory CNAP (r = -0.61) values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that there could be a relationship between the diminished amplitudes of axons of the peripheral nerve and the increase in serum ubiquitin levels in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further studies are required to confirm this relationship </plain></SENT>
