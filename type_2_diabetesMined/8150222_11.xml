<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examined the glucokinase gene in 270 American Black women, including 94 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> whose <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> resolved after pregnancy (<z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> only), 77 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> who developed Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after pregnancy (overt <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>), and 99 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects who were recruited during the peripartum period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two simple sequence repeat polymorphisms flanking either end of the glucokinase gene were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No association was found between glucokinase alleles and <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> only or overt <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, after adjustment for multiple comparisons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To detect single base changes, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 11 exons and proximal islet and liver promoter regions were examined by polymerase chain reaction plus single-stranded conformational polymorphism analysis in 45 <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> only patients who had not yet developed Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine coding region variants were identified: Ala11 (GCC) to Thr11 (ACC) in islet exon 1, and 8 variants either in untranslated regions or in the third base of a codon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four variant sites were found in introns, but none in splicing consensus sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the promoter regions revealed two common variants, G--&gt;A at islet -30 (24%), and G--&gt;A at liver -258 (42%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of the promoter variants, determined by allele specific polymerase chain reaction analysis, but did not differ among the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, no significant coding sequence glucokinase mutations were found in 90 alleles from 45 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
