<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we aimed to refine this association and investigate the role of low-frequency WFS1 variants in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: For fine-mapping, we sequenced WFS1 exons, splice junctions, and conserved noncoding sequences in samples from 24 type 2 diabetic case and 68 control subjects, selected tagging SNPs, and genotyped these in 959 U.K. type 2 diabetic case and 1,386 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The same genomic regions were sequenced in samples from 1,235 type 2 diabetic case and 1,668 control subjects to compare the frequency of rarer variants between case and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 31 tagging SNPs, the strongest associated was the previously untested 3' untranslated region rs1046320 (P = 0.008); odds ratio 0.84 and P = 6.59 x 10(-7) on further replication in 3,753 case and 4,198 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High correlation between rs1046320 and the original strongest SNP (rs10010131) (r2 = 0.92) meant that we could not differentiate between their effects in our samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the cumulative frequency of 82 rare (minor allele frequency [MAF] &lt;0.01) nonsynonymous variants between type 2 diabetic case and control subjects (P = 0.79) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two intermediate frequency (MAF 0.01-0.05) nonsynonymous changes also showed no statistical association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We identified six highly correlated SNPs that show strong and comparable associations with risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but further refinement of these associations will require large sample sizes (&gt;100,000) or studies in ethnically diverse populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Low frequency variants in WFS1 are unlikely to have a large impact on type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk in white U.K. populations, highlighting the complexities of undertaking association studies with low-frequency variants identified by resequencing </plain></SENT>
