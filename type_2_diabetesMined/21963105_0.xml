<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: People prescribed a first insulin (2000-2007) after 2-3 non-insulin <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> lowering treatments (OGLD) were identified from the THIN UK primary care database and grouped by insulin, detemir (n=165), glargine (n=1011) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> (n=420) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Time from beginning insulin to the prescription of another insulin type or a glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> was compared between insulins in a Cox model adjusting for: demographics, HbA1c, history of vascular complications and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The strength of association between duration of use and these variables was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The adjusted hazard ratios compared to glargine for treatment change were 1.58 (95% CI 1.25, 2.00) for detemir and 1.49 (1.25, 1.78) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lower mean treatment HbA(1c) correlated with longer time to a different insulin regimen (Spearman rank correlation -0.30, p&lt;0.01) as were continuing OGLDs, older age, longer time from diagnosis, lower body mass index, lower HbA(1c), and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: People who began treatment with glargine and those with better on-treatment HbA(1c) remained on their first insulin for longer than those who began detemir or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
