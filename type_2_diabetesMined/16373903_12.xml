<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Postprandial glycemia is an independent risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> that is more powerful than fasting glycemia and determines myocardial perfusion defects in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the efficacy of two different insulin regimes (regular insulin and insulin analog) in controlling <z:hpo ids='HP_0011998'>postprandial hyperglycemia</z:hpo> and in preventing myocardial perfusion abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 20 consecutive type 2 diabetic patients and 20 control subjects were enrolled in this randomized, three-way, cross-over, placebo-controlled study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Myocardial perfusion was assessed by myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE) in fasting and postprandial (120 min) state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Insulin analog was associated with lower, but not statistically significant, postprandial glycemia than regular insulin (<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> increase: 116 +/- 8 vs. 136 +/- 5%, P = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the area under the curve following insulin analog was significantly lower than regular insulin (18,354 +/- 702 vs. 20,757 +/- 738 mg per 120 min, P = 0.032) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fasting myocardial flow velocity (beta), myocardial blood volume (MBV), and myocardial blood flow (MBF) did not differ between control and type 2 diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Postprandial beta (0.67 +/- 0.24 vs. 0.92 +/- 0.25, P &lt; 0.01), MBV (8.4 +/- 2 vs. 10.9 +/- 1.2, P &lt; 0.01), and MBF (5.6 +/- 2 vs. 9.9 +/- 2.8, P &lt; 0.01) increased significantly in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, during placebo in the postprandial state, beta increased (0.65 +/- 0.27 vs. 0.89 +/- 0.24, P &lt; 0.01), while MBV (8.34 +/- 1.2 vs. 4.3 +/- 1.3, P &lt; 0.01) and MBF (5.4 +/- 1.5 vs. 3.4 +/- 0.9, P &lt; 0.01) decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similar changes in MCE variables were observed after regular insulin: beta increased (0.65 +/- 0.22 vs. 0.92 +/- 0.12, P &lt; 0.01) and MBV (8.2 +/- 2 vs. 5.2 +/- 1.16, P &lt; 0.01) and MBF (5.4 +/- 1.9 vs. 4.2 +/- 0.86, P &lt; 0.01) were reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After insulin analog, postprandial beta (0.66 +/- 0.18 vs. 0.9 +/- 0.18, P &lt; 0.01), MBV (8.2 +/- 1.6 vs. 9.6 +/- 1.2, P &lt; 0.01), and MBF (5.4 +/- 2 vs. 7.2 +/- 1.9, P &lt; 0.01) increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Values of postprandial MBV and MBF were higher after insulin analog than regular insulin treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Insulin analog partially reversed myocardial perfusion abnormalities observed in postprandial state by improving <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control </plain></SENT>
