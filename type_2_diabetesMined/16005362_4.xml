<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effects of Goshajinkigan (GJG), a Chinese herbal medicine, on insulin sensitivity in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> using the homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-R) and the euglycemic insulin clamp procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Daily oral administration of GJG (7.5 g/day) was performed for 1 month in 71 type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients: the GJG treatment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HOMA-Rs were calculated before and after 1 month of GJG treatment and compared with those of 44 controls who were matched in terms of sex, age, body mass index (BMI) and HbA1c levels with the experimental group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 64 patients out of the GJG treatment group, HOMA-R was calculated 1 month after discontinuation of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, euglycemic clamp was conducted in eight patients before and after the GJG treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HOMA-R was 4.78+/-0.37 (means+/-S.E.) before GJG treatment and significantly decreased to 4.02+/-0.25 after GJG treatment (P=0.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant change was observed in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HOMA-R returned to the pre-treatment level (P=0.018) 1 month after GJG treatment discontinuation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> infusion rates and metabolic clearance rates determined by the high-dose euglycemic clamp increased after 1 month of GJG treatment (from 9.6+/-1.1 to 11.1+/-0.7 mg/kg/min, P=0.045 and from 7.9+/-0.8 to 9.1+/-0.8 ml/kg/min, P=0.046, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that GJG administration might be useful for improving <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
