<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to compare the effect of ACE versus non-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitor</z:chebi> therapy on incident electrocardiographic (ECG) evidence of LVH (ECG-LVH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This prespecified study compared the incidence of ECG-LVH by Sokolow-Lyon and Cornell voltage criteria in 816 hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients of the Bergamo Nephrologic <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Complications Trial (BENEDICT), who had no ECG-LVH at baseline and were randomly assigned to at least 3 years of blinded ACE inhibition with trandolapril (2 mg/day) or to non-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitor</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment was titrated to systolic/diastolic blood pressure &lt;130/80 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ECG readings were centralized and blinded to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Baseline characteristics of the two groups were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Over a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 36 (24-48) months, 13 of the 423 patients (3.1%) receiving trandolapril compared with 31 of the 376 patients (8.2%) receiving non-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitor</z:chebi> therapy developed ECG-LVH (hazard ratio [HR] 0.34 [95% CI 0.18-0.65], P = 0.0012 unadjusted, and 0.35 [0.18-0.68], P = 0.0018 adjusted for predefined baseline covariates) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The HR was significant even after adjustment for follow-up blood pressure and blood pressure reduction versus baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with baseline, both Sokolow-Lyon and Cornell voltages significantly decreased with trandolapril but did not change with non-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitor</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ACE inhibition has a specific protective effect against the development of ECG-LVH that is additional to its blood pressure-lowering effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Because ECG-LVH is a strong <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factor</z:e> in people with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, early ACE inhibition may be cardioprotective in this population </plain></SENT>
