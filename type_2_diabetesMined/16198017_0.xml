<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We sought to identify lifestyle behaviours which influence risk of impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism, IGM (newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> [IGT] or impaired fasting glycemia [IFG]) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (IR) in a predominantly Maori community, and applied the McAuley formula to determine whether it predicts high risk individuals amongst this community </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three hundred and seventy one participants completed a lifestyle and dietary behaviour questionnaire and oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical variables, <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp>, fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp>, IFG and IGT were defined according to WHO criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IR was defined using the McAuley formula </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Those with IGM and those with IR showed similar risk factor attributes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios (95% CI) for development of IGM and IR were 0.43 (0.21-0.88) and 0.51 (0.33-0.80), respectively, for regular physical activity, and 0.55 (0.26-1.15) and 0.59 (0.37-0.96), respectively, for two or more dietary behaviours characterized by a high intake of fibre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Regular physical activity and a diet characterized by a high intake of dietary fibre were found to reduce risk of newly diagnosed IGM or IR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The McAuley formula appears to predict high-risk individuals in a predominantly Maori population as it does in European populations </plain></SENT>
