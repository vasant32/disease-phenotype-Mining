<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The "portal hypothesis" proposes that the liver is directly exposed to free fatty acids and cytokines increasingly released from visceral fat tissue into the portal vein of <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects, thus rendering visceral fat accumulation particularly hazardous for the development of hepatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we used a fat transplantation paradigm to (artificially) increase intra-abdominal fat mass to test the hypothesis that venous drainage of fat tissue determines its impact on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Epididymal fat pads of C57Bl6/J donor mice were transplanted into littermates, either to the parietal peritoneum (caval/systemic venous drainage) or, by using a novel approach, to the mesenterium, which confers portal venous drainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Only mice receiving the portal drained fat transplant developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> and hepatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of proinflammatory cytokines was increased in both portally and systemically transplanted fat pads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, portal vein (but not systemic) plasma levels of interleukin (IL)-6 were elevated only in mice receiving a portal fat transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly, mice receiving portal drained transplants from IL-6 knockout mice showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that the metabolic fate of intra-abdominal fat tissue transplantation is determined by the delivery of inflammatory cytokines to the liver specifically via the portal system, providing direct evidence in support of the portal hypothesis </plain></SENT>
