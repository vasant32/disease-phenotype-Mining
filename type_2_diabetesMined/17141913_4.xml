<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this longitudinal study 4479 non-diabetic men and women aged &gt; or =20 years were followed for 3.6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> with its risk factors and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> were defined according to the <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> and the WHO criteria, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in model 1 including only the anthropometric measure and in model 2 adjusted for common <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk factors and in model 3 adjusted for other anthropometric indices plus <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the variables in model 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 166 new cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In subjects aged &lt;60 years general <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and high waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) predicted <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three models with OR of 2.4 and 2.6 in model 3, respectively, while high waist circumference (WC) lost it association with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the full model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In subjects aged &gt; or =60 years, however, high WC was the only independent predictor of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in model 3 with OR of 3.8 while high WHR and general <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> predicted <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in models 1 and 2, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: General <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and high WHR in Iranian subjects aged &lt;60 years and high WC in older ones are the important predictors of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
