<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Serum ferritin and transferrin were shown to be associated with muscle <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (IR) and T2DM, but little is known about the role of iron metabolism on adipose tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore investigated whether markers of iron metabolism were associated with adipocyte IR and plasma adiponectin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Serum ferritin, transferrin, total iron, non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI), transferrin saturation, and plasma adiponectin were determined in 492 individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adipocyte IR was defined by the product of fasting insulin and nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using linear regression analyses, we investigated the difference in adipocyte IR or adiponectin (in %) according to differences in iron metabolism markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum ferritin (β = 1.00% increase in adipocyte IR per 10 μg/L [95% CI 0.66-1.34]), transferrin (4.18% per 0.1 g/L [2.88-5.50]), total iron (1.36% per μmol/L [0.61-2.12]), and NTBI (5.14% per μmol/L [1.88-8.52]) were associated with adipocyte IR after adjustment for several covariates, including inflammatory markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> markers of iron metabolism were also associated with NEFAs (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, ferritin and transferrin were inversely associated with adiponectin (both P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The observed associations of several markers of iron metabolism with adipocyte IR and adiponectin suggest that factors related to iron and iron metabolism may contribute to adipocyte IR early in the pathogenesis of T2DM </plain></SENT>
