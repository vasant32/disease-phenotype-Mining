<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The U.K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prospective <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study (UKPDS) has demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> is as effective as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects and is associated with less <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>, fewer <z:hpo ids='HP_0001988'>hypoglycemic episodes</z:hpo>, and better cardiovascular outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is hence the pharmacological therapy of choice in this subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, a gap in our present knowledge is the long-term response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> in nonobese individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, we compared <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> therapy in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, overweight, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A database of patients treated at a referral center in Sydney, Australia, were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and complete HbA(1c) (A1C) data and treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> monotherapy for at least three visits before receiving dual oral therapy were included (n = 644) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis by BMI and the type of oral agent was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Individuals were categorized as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, overweight, or <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (BMI &lt;25, 25-29.9, and &gt;/=30 kg/m(2), respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no differences between the initial, follow-up, and last A1C between the three <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>-treated groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The duration of successful glycemic control with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and overweight individuals and their incidences of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related complications for the entire duration of follow-up were not inferior to those of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The nonobese patients performed better regardless of the type of oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agent</z:chebi> used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> is at least as efficacious in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and overweight individuals as it is in those who are <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our study provides evidence-based data to support <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> use in nonobese individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
