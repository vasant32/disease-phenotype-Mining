<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Scd-null mice display a beneficial metabolic phenotype characterised by resistance to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020473" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperlipidaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The human homologue, SCD, maps to a region of chromosome 10 linked to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and SCD activity correlates with insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Given this strong positional and biological candidacy, the present study sought to establish whether sequence variation in SCD influences susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and related traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The SCD gene was resequenced in 23 diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six variants within coding and adjacent sequence, including a non-synonymous SNP in exon 5 (M224L), were selected for genotyping in a primary set of 608 diabetic subjects and 600 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no association (at the allele, genotype or haplotype level) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, although genotype frequencies at the +14301 A&gt;C SNP in the 3' untranslated region showed borderline association (p~0.06) when evidence for linkage was taken into account </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, replication studies (350 young-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> diabetic patients; 747 controls) failed to confirm any relationship with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for this variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant associations were seen for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related traits including BMI and waist-to-hip ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The present study, the first reported analysis of this gene, indicates that the SCD variants typed do not explain chromosome-10-encoded susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although this study provided no evidence that SCD sequence variation influences <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility or related traits, SCD remains a major target for pharmaceutical and/or environmental manipulation </plain></SENT>
