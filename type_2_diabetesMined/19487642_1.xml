<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE It is unclear whether the coronary atherosclerotic plaque burden is similar in patients with type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By using multislice computed tomography (MSCT), the presence, degree, and <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD) in patients with type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Prospectively, coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring and MSCT coronary angiography were performed in 135 asymptomatic patients (65 patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 70 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence and extent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004929'>coronary atherosclerosis</z:hpo> as well as plaque phenotype were assessed and compared between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS No difference was observed in average CAC score (217 +/- 530 vs. 174 +/- 361) or in the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004929'>coronary atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (65% vs. 71%) in patients with type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the prevalence of obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was higher in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 24; 34%) compared with that in patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 11; 17%) (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, a higher mean number of atherosclerotic and obstructive plaques was observed in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the percentage of noncalcified plaques was higher in patients with type 2 (66%) versus type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (27%) (P &lt; 0.001), resulting in a higher plaque burden for each CAC score compared with that in type 1 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS Although CAC scores and the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004929'>coronary atherosclerosis</z:hpo> were similar between patients with type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, CAD was more extensive in the latter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Also, a relatively higher proportion of noncalcified plaques was observed in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These observations may be valuable in the development of targeted management strategies adapted to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> type </plain></SENT>
