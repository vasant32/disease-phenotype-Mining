<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was an additional 80-week, multicentre, double-blind and active-controlled extension to a 24-week core study comparing the treatments of vildagliptin (50 mg b.i.d., n = 396) to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> (8 mg q.d., n = 202) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary efficacy variable was the mean change in <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA1c) from the core study baseline (day 1) to the end of 104 weeks (the extension endpoint) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Vildagliptin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> showed statistically significant and sustained HbA1c reductions from a core mean baseline of 8.6 and 8.7% to 7.8 and 7.3% respectively (both significant, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>-treated patients showed significantly greater mean HbA1c reductions (mean difference 0.62%, s.e </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>0.13, p &lt; 0.001) compared with vildagliptin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile significantly improved with vildagliptin compared to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Body weight remained unchanged in vildagliptin-treated patients despite improvements in glycaemic control but significantly increased (mean change from core study baseline 4.67 kg) in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>-treated patients (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Notably, a lower incidence of peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> was seen with vildagliptin (4.6%) compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> treatment (11.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>More serious adverse events (SAEs) occurred in vildagliptin- than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>-treated patients (12.5 and 9.1% respectively), but only one SAE each in both treatment group was suspected to be related to study drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three non-study drug-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (vildagliptin: 2 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>: 1) were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Four mild hypoglycaemic events were observed with vildagliptin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the similar short-term HbA1c reductions seen with both vildagliptin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> treatments were more durable after 104 weeks of treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> than vildagliptin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, this greater durability with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> was at the expense of <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> (almost 5 kg), higher incidences of peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> and a less favourable plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile compared with vildagliptin </plain></SENT>
