<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE-SUMO4 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was recently found to be mainly expressed in the kidney, and the methionine-to-valine substitution at codon 55 (M55V) variant of SUMO4 may induce higher nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because NF-kappaB is known to mediate the development of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, we examined the association between the SUMO4 M55V variant and the severity of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS-We recruited a total of 430 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The M55V (rs237025, 163A--&gt;G) polymorphism of SUMO4 was genotyped by real-time PCR, and urine albumin concentration was measured by radioimmunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS-The frequencies of SUMO4 AA, GA, and GG were 52.6, 40.7, and 6.7%, respectively, in the normoalbuminuric group; 45.5, 47.3, and 7.1% in the microalbuminuric group; and 36.9, 46.2, and 16.9% in the macroalbuminuric group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We detected a significant linear trend for SUMO4 genotype between the macroalbuminuric and normoalbuminuric groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean urine albumin-to-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio (42.3 +/- 108.82 mg/mmol) in the GG group was significantly higher than in the AA (14.9 +/- 51.49 mg/mmol) and GA (17.0 +/- 43.74 mg/mmol) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed the SUMO4 M55V variant to be independently associated with the severity of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS-This study indicates that the SUMO4 gene M55V variant is associated with severity of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
