<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty subjects [9/21 females/males; mean ± SD age: 60.7 ± 7.7 years; body mass index (BMI): 33.5 ± 3.3 kg/m(2) ; duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>: 6.8 ± 4.6 years; HbA1c: 7.1 ± 0.8%] were included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They fasted overnight and then received a 0.2 U/kg subcutaneous dose of glulisine or aspart 2 min before starting a standardized test meal, 7 days apart, according to a randomization schedule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were taken every 15 min, starting 20 min before the meal and ending 6 h postprandially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The area under the absolute <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration-time curve between 0 and 1 h after insulin injection and maximal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration was significantly lower with glulisine than with aspart (p = 0.0455 and 0.0337, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, for the total study period, plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration was similar for glulisine and aspart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Peak insulin concentration was significantly higher for glulisine than for insulin aspart (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hypoglycaemic events (≤ 70 mg/dl with or without symptoms) occurred in 13 and 16 subjects treated with glulisine and aspart, respectively, but there were no cases of severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> requiring intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Glulisine was associated with lower <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels during the first hour after a standard meal; the remaining <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> profiles were otherwise equivalent, with higher insulin levels observed throughout the study period </plain></SENT>
