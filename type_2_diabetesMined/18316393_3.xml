<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Increasing evidence suggests that macrovascular disease and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> may be more closely linked than previously believed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We determined the relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004929'>coronary atherosclerosis</z:hpo> as measured by computed tomography-detectable coronary artery calcium (CAC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The cross-sectional association between CAC and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> was assessed on a Veteran Affairs <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Trial subsample of 204 subjects with a mean duration of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> of 12.3 +/- 8.3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>Retinopathy</z:hpo> was correlated with CAC (r = 0.19, P = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median CAC increased across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> categories: 197 in those with no <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, 229 in those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333101" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microaneurysms</z:e> only, 364 in those with mild nonproliferative diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (NPDR), 300 in those with moderate to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0730278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">severe NPDR</z:e>, and 981 in those with proliferative diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDR</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stepwise multivariable linear regression analysis was performed to find a parsimonious subset of relevant risk factors to include along with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDR</z:e> in predicting CAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for either this subset of standard factors (P = 0.047) or a more extensive panel of risk factors (P = 0.035), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDR</z:e> was significantly associated with CAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, using logistic regression, individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDR</z:e> were approximately sixfold more likely to have CAC &gt;400 than those with no <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDR</z:e>, even after adjustment for other <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate an important relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> and extent of CAC and suggest the potential to identify and treat shared risk factors for these common micro- and macrovascular complications </plain></SENT>
