<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is uncertain whether ethnicity modifies the effect of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> on <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> following pregnancy with and without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> for Chinese and South Asian women compared with white women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using healthcare databases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 1,050,108 women aged 20-49 with live births between January 1995 and June 2008 in Ontario were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were followed for up to 15 years for the diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The age-standardised prevalences of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> were 4.1%, 7.1% and 2.9% for Chinese, South Asian and white women, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence of diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at the median follow-up time of 7.6 years was 16.5% and 1.8% for Chinese women with and without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e>, 31.8% and 3.6% for South Asian women with and without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e>, and 25.7% and 1.8% for white women with and without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> conferred an increase in the risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after pregnancy of more than 13-fold in white women, but only a nine- to tenfold increase among Chinese and South Asian women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Although one-third of South Asian women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> were diagnosed with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> within 8 years postpartum, the incremental impact of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> on <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk was not as strong among Chinese and South Asian women as it was among white women </plain></SENT>
