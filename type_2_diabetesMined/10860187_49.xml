<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 110 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (55 with no <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> [the primary prevention cohort] and 55 with simple <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> [the secondary intervention cohort]) were randomly assigned to multiple insulin injection therapy (<z:chebi fb="75" ids="27847,53620">MIT</z:chebi>) groups and administered three or more daily insulin injections or assigned to conventional insulin injection therapy (CIT) groups and administered one or two daily intermediate-acting insulin injections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Worsening of microvascular complications was regularly assessed during 8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two or more steps up in the 19 stages of the modified Early Treatment of Diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>Retinopathy</z:hpo> Study classification in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> and one or more stages up among three stages in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> (normoalbuminuria, <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp>) were defined as worsening of complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In both primary prevention and secondary intervention cohorts, the cumulative percentages of worsening in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> were significantly lower (P &lt; 0.05) in the <z:chebi fb="75" ids="27847,53620">MIT</z:chebi> group than in the CIT group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In neurological tests after 8 years, the <z:chebi fb="75" ids="27847,53620">MIT</z:chebi> group showed significant improvement (P &lt; 0.05) in the median nerve conduction velocities (motor and sensory nerves), whereas the CIT group showed significant deterioration (P &lt; 0.05) in the nerve conduction velocities and vibration threshold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From this study, the glycemic threshold to prevent the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and progression of diabetic microvascular complications was as follows: HbA1c &lt; 6.5%, fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration &lt; 110 mg/dl, and 2-h postprandial blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration &lt; 180 mg/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intensive glycemic control can delay the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and progression of the early stages of diabetic microvascular complications in Japanese patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
