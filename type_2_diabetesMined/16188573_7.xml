<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined how <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> influences the levels of several in vivo markers for coagulation and fibrinolysis in 26 Type 2 DM patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diabetic patients received 20 mg/day of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> up to 12 months </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Levels of prothrombin fragment 1+2 (F1+2), factor VII, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) antigens, but not tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) antigen, in the pre-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> plasmas of the diabetic patients were significantly higher than the levels found in plasmas of healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant reductions in F1+2 and PAI-1 levels were evident &gt; or =6 weeks after the diabetic patients received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
