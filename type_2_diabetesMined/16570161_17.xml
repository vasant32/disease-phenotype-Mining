<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The main amyloid constituent is the beta cell-derived <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25905">polypeptide hormone</z:chebi> islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (IAPP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In general, amyloid refers to an extracellular deposit of a congophilic material, but intracellular amyloid is seen in some beta cells of transgenic mice expressing the gene for human IAPP and in human islets transplanted into <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to immunohistochemically characterise the intracellular amyloid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Antisera against the N- and C-terminal processing sites of proIAPP (which were therefore specific for proIAPP), the C-terminal flanking <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> and mature IAPP were used for immunoelectron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fibrillar aggregates were seen in the halo region of the secretory granules in some beta cells in human IAPP transgenic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These aggregates were labelled with proIAPP-specific antisera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also, proIAPP reactivity was more widespread in the intracellular amyloid-like aggregates in beta cells of transgenic mice than in human islet transplants, in which the intracellular amyloid-like deposits were larger, but the proIAPP labelling was restricted to small spots within the amyloid deposits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We suggest that proIAPP forms the first amyloid fibrils and that this can occur already in the secretory granules of the beta cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The proIAPP-derived fibrils can act as seed for further amyloid formation, now made up by IAPP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The observed difference between human islet transplants and human IAPP transgenic animals may reflect differences in stages of amyloid development </plain></SENT>
