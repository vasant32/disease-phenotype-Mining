<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Urinary and serum betaig-h3 levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 163 type 2 diabetic patients and 101 healthy control subjects of comparable age and weight </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data show that urinary levels of betaig-h3 are elevated in type 2 diabetic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> and may be used as a marker of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
