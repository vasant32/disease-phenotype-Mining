<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a 26-week, multicentre, open-label parallel trial in which subjects poorly controlled with mono- or dual-oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> therapy were randomized 1 : 1 : 1 to instead receive repaglinide/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> either BID or TID or a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> BID </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two primary hypotheses were tested in a hierarchical manner: (i) treatment with the repaglinide/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> BID is non-inferior to that of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> BID as measured by changes in <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA1c) (results presented in companion paper) and (ii) repaglinide/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> BID is non-inferior to repaglinide/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> TID (as measured by changes in HbA1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additional efficacy and safety end-points were also assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 561 subjects were randomized; 383 completed the study </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, changes in mean fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> values from baseline to end of study were not significantly different between the BID and the TID dose groups </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The efficacy of twice-daily dosing of a repaglinide/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> tablet was non-inferior to that of three-times-daily dosing </plain></SENT>
