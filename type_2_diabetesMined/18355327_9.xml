<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: For many patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> agents (OADs) do not provide optimal glycaemic control, necessitating insulin therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fear of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> is a major barrier to initiating insulin therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The AT.LANTUS study investigated optimal methods to initiate and maintain insulin glargine (LANTUS, glargine, Sanofi-aventis, Paris, France) therapy using two treatment algorithms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This subgroup analysis investigated the initiation of once-daily glargine therapy in patients suboptimally controlled on multiple OADs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This study was a 24-week, multinational (59 countries), multicenter (611), randomized study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Algorithm 1 was a clinic-driven titration and algorithm 2 was a patient-driven titration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Titration was based on target fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &lt; or =100 mg/dl (&lt; or =5.5 mmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Algorithms were compared for incidence of severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> [requiring assistance and blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &lt;50 mg/dl (&lt;2.8 mmol/l)] and baseline to end-point change in <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c) (HbA(1c)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 4961 patients enrolled in the study, 865 were included in this subgroup analysis: 340 received glargine plus 1 OAD and 525 received glargine plus &gt;1 OAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Incidence of severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> was &lt;1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>HbA(1c) decreased significantly between baseline and end-point for patients receiving glargine plus 1 OAD (-1.4%, p &lt; 0.001; algorithm 1 -1.3% vs. algorithm 2 -1.5%; p = 0.03) and glargine plus &gt;1 OAD (-1.7%, p &lt; 0.001; algorithm 1 -1.5% vs. algorithm 2 -1.8%; p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that initiation of once-daily glargine with OADs results in significant reduction of HbA(1c) with a low risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The greater reduction in HbA(1c) was seen in patients randomized to the patient-driven algorithm (algorithm 2) on 1 or &gt;1 OAD </plain></SENT>
