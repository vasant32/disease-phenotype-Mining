<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated potential proatherogenic properties of apoCIII-containing <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> from hypertriglyceridemic patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> was isolated from control subjects, subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and apoB transgenic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-biglycan binding was analyzed with a solid-phase assay using immunoplates coated with biglycan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">Lipid</z:chebi> composition was analyzed with mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hydrolysis of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> by sphingomyelinase was analyzed after labeling plasma <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> with [(3)H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17636">sphingomyelin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ApoCIII isoforms were quantified after isoelectric focusing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Human aortic endothelial cells were incubated with desialylated apoCIII or with <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> enriched with specific apoCIII isoforms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We showed that enriching <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> with apoCIII only induced a small increase in <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycan</z:chebi> binding, and this effect was dependent on a functional site A in apoB100 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicated that intrinsic characteristics of the diabetic <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> other than apoCIII are responsible for further increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycan</z:chebi> binding of diabetic <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> with high-endogenous apoCIII, and we showed alterations in the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> composition of diabetic <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> with high apoCIII </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We also demonstrated that high apoCIII increased susceptibility of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> to hydrolysis and aggregation by sphingomyelinases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, we demonstrated that sialylation of apoCIII increased with increasing apoCIII content and that sialylation of apoCIII was essential for its proinflammatory properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated a number of features of apoCIII-containing <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> from hypertriglyceridemic patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> that could explain the proatherogenic role of apoCIII </plain></SENT>
