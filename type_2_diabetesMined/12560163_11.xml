<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Insulin lispro Mix25 and human insulin 30/70 were compared in an open-label, multicenter, randomised, crossover study involving 151 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each treatment period had a duration of 14 days during which the patients self-monitored their BG before and 2 h after the main meals on any 3 days within the last 5 days of each treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 2 h <z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi> excursion following the main evening meal after sunset was significantly lower with insulin lispro Mix25 (3.4+/-2.9 mmol/l) compared with human insulin 30/70 (4.0+/-3.2 mmol/l, P=0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The evening pre-meal fasting BG values were also lower with insulin lispro Mix25 (7.1+/-2.2 mmol/l) versus human insulin 30/70 (7.5+/-2.6 mmol/l, P=0.034) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The average daily BG concentration was 9.5+/-2.4 mmol/l during treatment with insulin lispro Mix25 versus 10.1+/-2.5 mmol/l with human insulin 30/70 given in identical doses (P=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: When compared with human insulin 30/70, treatment of insulin-requiring Type 2 patients with insulin lispro Mix25 during Ramadan resulted in better average daily glycaemia, and better BG control before and after the evening meal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Insulin lispro Mix25 should be considered as a therapeutic option during Ramadan </plain></SENT>
