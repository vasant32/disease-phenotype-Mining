<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To test the potential for members of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein (MAP) kinase family to contribute to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we examined basal and insulin-stimulated Erk 1/2, JNK, and p38 phosphorylation in adipocytes isolated from healthy and type 2 diabetic individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Maximal insulin stimulation increased the phosphorylation of Erk 1/2 and JNK in healthy control subjects but not type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Insulin stimulation did not increase p38 phosphorylation in either healthy control subjects or type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In type 2 diabetic adipocytes, the basal phosphorylation status of these MAP kinases was significantly elevated and was associated with decreased IRS-1 and GLUT4 in these fat cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To determine whether MAP kinases were involved in the downregulation of IRS-1 and GLUT4 protein levels, selective inhibitors were used to inhibit these MAP kinases in 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated chronically with insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of Erk 1/2, JNK, or p38 had no effect on insulin-stimulated reduction of IRS-1 protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, inhibition of the p38 pathway prevented the insulin-stimulated decrease in GLUT4 protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In summary, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is associated with an increased basal activation of the MAP kinase family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, upregulation of the p38 pathway might contribute to the loss of GLUT4 expression observed in adipose tissue from type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
