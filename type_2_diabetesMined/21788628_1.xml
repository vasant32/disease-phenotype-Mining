<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To develop a model for the prediction of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) risk on the basis of a multivariate logistic model and 1-h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration (1-h PG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The model was developed in a cohort of 1,562 nondiabetic subjects from the San Antonio Heart Study (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SAHS</z:e>) and validated in 2,395 nondiabetic subjects in the Botnia Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A risk score on the basis of anthropometric parameters, plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile, and blood pressure was computed for each subject </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects with a risk score above a certain cut point were considered to represent high-risk individuals, and their 1-h PG concentration during the oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test was used to further refine their future T2DM risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We used the San Antonio <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Prediction Model (SADPM) to generate the initial risk score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A risk-score value of 0.065 was found to be an optimal cut point for initial screening and selection of high-risk individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A 1-h PG concentration &gt;140 mg/dL in high-risk individuals (whose risk score was &gt;0.065) was the optimal cut point for identification of subjects at increased risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The two cut points had 77.8, 77.4, and 44.8% (for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SAHS</z:e>) and 75.8, 71.6, and 11.9% (for the Botnia Study) sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value, respectively, in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SAHS</z:e> and Botnia Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A two-step model, based on the combination of the SADPM and 1-h PG, is a useful tool for the identification of high-risk Mexican-American and Caucasian individuals </plain></SENT>
