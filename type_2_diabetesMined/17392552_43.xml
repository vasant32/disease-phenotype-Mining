<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a cross-sectional study of 355 type 2 diabetic men aged &gt;30 years, total and bioavailable <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="25" ids="50112">sex hormone</z:chebi>-binding globulin, BMI, and waist circumference were measured and free <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0000135'>hypogonadism</z:hpo> was defined as the presence of clinical symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000135'>hypogonadism</z:hpo> and low <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> level (total <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> &lt;8 nmol/l and/or bioavailable <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> &lt;2.5 nmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Borderline <z:hpo ids='HP_0000135'>hypogonadism</z:hpo> was defined as the presence of symptoms and total <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> of 8-12 nmol/l or bioavailable <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> of 2.5-4 nmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A low blood <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> level was common in diabetic men, and a significant proportion of these men had symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000135'>hypogonadism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0000135'>hypogonadism</z:hpo> was seen in 17% of men with total <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> &lt;8 nmol/l and 14% with bioavailable <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> &lt;2.5 nmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Borderline <z:hpo ids='HP_0000135'>hypogonadism</z:hpo> was found in 25% of men with total <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> 8-12 nmol/l and bioavailable <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> between 2.5 and 4 nmol/l; 42% of the men had free <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> &lt;0.255 nmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BMI and waist circumference were both significantly negatively correlated with <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> levels in men, with the association being stronger for waist circumference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">Testosterone</z:chebi> levels are frequently low in men with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and the majority of these men have symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000135'>hypogonadism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
