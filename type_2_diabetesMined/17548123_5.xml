<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For this analysis, we included 321 full and 36 half sibling pairs affected with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2D) from West Africa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A genome-wide panel of 390 tri-nucleotide and tetra-nucleotide repeats with an average distance of 8.9 cM was performed on a total of 691 persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Variance components based on multipoint linkage approach as implemented in SOLAR were performed for log C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant linkage evidences were observed on 10q23 at D10S2327 with a LOD score of 4.04 (nominal p-value=0.000008, empirical p-value=0.0004); and on 4p15 at D4S2632 with a LOD score of 3.48 (nominal p-value=0.000031, empirical p-value=0.0013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other suggestive evidence of linkage were observed on 15q14 at D15S659 with a LOD score 2.41 (nominal p-value=0.000435, empirical p-value=0.0068), and on 18p11 near D18S976 with a LOD score 2.18 (nominal p-value=0.000771 and empirical p-value=0.0094) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, five positional candidate genes for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and related complications are located in our linkage region (the pituitary adenylate cyclase activating <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (PACAP in 18p11); the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 (PPARGC1 in 4p15); PTEN, PPP1R5, and IDE located in 10q23 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we identified four major genetic loci (10q23, 4p15, 15q14, and 18p11) influencing C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> concentration in West Africans with T2D </plain></SENT>
