<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the most commonly used non-invasive test of endothelial function (flow-mediated dilation [FMD]) is technically challenging to perform, and no previous studies have carefully examined the reproducibility of FMD measurements in individuals with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we tested the hypothesis that larger day-to-day changes in insulin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> are associated with larger fluctuations in FMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ultrasound was used to measure the FMD (% change from baseline diameter) of the brachial artery in 18 healthy adults with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on three separate occasions, in the absence of changes to diet, activity level or medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CV and mean deviations between pairs of FMD scores in the same individual were used as the primary outcome variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The CV for FMD (29.7%) was higher than the level traditionally accepted for biochemical assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, this CV estimate is within the low range of published values for FMD in healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FMD scores were not significantly correlated with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> or insulin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, subjects with the largest variability in FMD also showed the largest fluctuations in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> ( r=0.52), insulin ( r=0.47) and heart rate ( r=0.48) ( p&lt;/=0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: FMD can be reliably measured in individuals with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and population-specific data on reliability is critical for the design of adequately powered studies of endothelial function </plain></SENT>
