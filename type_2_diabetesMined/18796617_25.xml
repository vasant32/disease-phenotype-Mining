<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Cytokines are elevated in various insulin-resistant states, including type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, although the contribution of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the induction of these diseases is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed the impact of IL-6 on insulin action in murine primary myocytes, skeletal muscle cell lines, and mice (<z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> and protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B [PTP1B] deficient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IL-6 per se increased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake by activating serine/threonine protein kinase 11 (LKB1)/<z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase/protein kinase B substrate of 160 kDa (AS160) pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A dual effect on insulin action was observed when myotubes and mice were exposed to this cytokine: additive with short-term insulin (increased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake and systemic insulin sensitivity) but <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> exposure produced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (impaired GLUT4 translocation to plasma membrane and defects in insulin signaling at the insulin receptor substrate 1 [IRS-1] level) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three mechanisms seem to operate in IL-6-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>: activation of c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase 1/2 (JNK1/2), accumulation of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (socs3) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, and an increase in PTP1B activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, silencing JNK1/2 with either small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> or chemical inhibitors impaired phosphorylation of IRS-1 (Ser307), restored insulin signaling, and normalized insulin-induced <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake in myotubes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When using a pharmacological approach, liver X receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> overcome IL-6-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> by producing downregulation of socs3 and ptp1b gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, the lack of PTP1B confers protection against IL-6-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in skeletal muscle in vitro and in vivo, in agreement with the protection against the IL-6 hyperglycemic effect observed on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin tolerance tests in adult male mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate the important role of IL-6 in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and further implicate PTP1B as a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
