<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (newly diagnosed, treated with diet and exercise only, or previously treated with oral diabetic medications) were randomly assigned to receive one of three extended-release <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> treatment regimens (1,500 mg/day q.d., 1,500 mg/day twice daily, or 2,000 mg/day q.d.) or immediate-release <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (1,500 mg/day twice daily) in a double-blind 24-week trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant decreases (P &lt; 0.001) in mean HbA(1c) (A1C) levels were observed by week 12 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean changes from baseline to end point in the two groups given 1,500 mg extended-release <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (-0.73 and -0.74%) were not significantly different from the change in the immediate-release <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> group (-0.70%), whereas the 2,000-mg extended-release <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> group showed a greater decrease in A1C levels (-1.06%; mean difference [2,000 mg extended-release <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> - immediate-release <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>]: -0.36 [98.4% CI -0.65 to -0.06]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rapid decreases in fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were observed by week 1, which continued until week 8, and were maintained for the duration of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall incidence of adverse events was similar for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treatment groups, but fewer patients in the extended-release <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> groups discontinued treatment due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> during the initial dosing period than in the immediate-release <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Once- or twice-daily extended-release <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> was as safe and effective as twice-daily immediate-release <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and provided continued glycemic control for up to 24 weeks of treatment </plain></SENT>
