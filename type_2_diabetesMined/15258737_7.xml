<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objectives of our study were to examine whether the BCHE K variant is associated with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or estimates of pancreatic beta cell function in large-scale populations of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-tolerant Caucasians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The variant was genotyped in association studies comprising a total of 1408 Type 2 diabetic patients and 4935 glucose-tolerant control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genotype-phenotype studies were carried out in the 4935 glucose-tolerant control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no difference in allele frequency between Type 2 diabetic patients and control subjects (20.3% [95% confidence interval: 18.8-21.8] vs 20.4% [19.6-21.2], non-significant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the genotype-phenotype studies we found no consistent association with BMI, fasting or post-OGTT plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, serum insulin or serum C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The present study does not support the suggestion that the BCHE K polymorphism is associated with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or with estimates of pancreatic beta cell function in large-scale Danish Caucasian populations </plain></SENT>
