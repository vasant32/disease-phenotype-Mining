<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Activation of VPAC1 has been implicated in elevating <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> output, whereas activation of VPAC2 may be involved in insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A hypothesis that a VPAC2-selective <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> would enhance <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal by stimulating insulin secretion without causing increased hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production was tested using a novel selective <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> of VPAC2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, BAY 55-9837, was generated through site-directed mutagenesis based on sequence alignments of PACAP, VIP, and related analogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> bound to VPAC2 with a dissociation constant (K(d)) of 0.65 nmol/l and displayed &gt;100-fold selectivity over VPAC1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BAY 55-9837 stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent insulin secretion in isolated rat and human pancreatic islets, increased insulin synthesis in purified rat islets, and caused a dose-dependent increase in plasma insulin levels in fasted rats, with a half-maximal stimulatory concentration of 3 pmol/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Continuous intravenous or subcutaneous infusion of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> reduced the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> area under the curve following an intraperitoneal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> had effects on intestinal water retention and mean arterial blood pressure in rats, but only at much higher doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>BAY 55-9837 may be a useful therapy for the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
