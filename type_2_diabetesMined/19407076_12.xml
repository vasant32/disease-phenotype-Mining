<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This meta-analysis aimed to elucidate the effect of replacing dietary fat with carbohydrate on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> parameters in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We searched for randomized trials that investigated the effects of two kinds of prescribed diets (a low-fat, high-carbohydrate [LFHC] diet and a high-fat, low-carbohydrate [HFLC] diet); in these studies, energy and protein intake did not differ significantly between the two dietary groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nineteen studies that included 306 patients met our inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median diet composition of carbohydrate/fat in the LFHC and HFLC diets was 58%/24% and 40%/40%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Changes in values for A1C, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG), and total and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> did not differ significantly between the LFHC and HFLC groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the LFHC diet significantly increased fasting insulin and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> by 8% (P = 0.02) and 13% (P &lt; 0.001), respectively, and lowered <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> by 6% (P &lt; 0.001) compared with the HFLC diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were positive associations among the magnitude of changes in FPG, fasting insulin, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> for the diets analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, stratified analysis indicated that the increase in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> was insignificant when accompanied by energy intake restriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested that replacing fat with carbohydrate could deteriorate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> while the adverse effect on <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> from the LFHC diet could be avoided by restricting energy intake to a degree sufficient for the attainment of weight reduction </plain></SENT>
