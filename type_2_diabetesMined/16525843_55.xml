<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Audit and Research in Tayside Scotland (DARTS) <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> information system and the Medicines Monitoring Unit (MEMO) dispensed prescribing database for the population of Tayside, Scotland (400,000 people) were employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients newly prescribed with oral hypoglycaemic agents between 1994 and 2001 were classified into five study cohorts according to the treatment received: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> only, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> only, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> added to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> added to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi>, and both drugs simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In Cox regression analyses, we estimated relative risks for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality and cardiovascular hospital admission for patients in the five study cohorts, with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy as the reference group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 5,730 study patients, 1,000 died during a maximum of 8 years follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> only cohort had increased risks of mortality and cardiovascular mortality, with unadjusted relative risks of 3.12 (95% CI 2.54-3.84) and 3.71 (95% CI 2.64-5.22), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for differences between groups (age, sex, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, blood pressure, cholesterol, HbA(1c), smoking, previous hospital admission, treatment with cardiovascular medication), these relative risks were 1.43 (95% CI 1.15-1.77) and 1.70 (95% CI 1.18-2.45), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients in the combination cohorts had significantly increased risks of cardiovascular hospital admission, as well as increased risks of mortality and cardiovascular mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In this cohort study of patients newly treated with oral hypoglycaemic agents, those treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> only, or combinations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, were at higher risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes than those treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> alone </plain></SENT>
