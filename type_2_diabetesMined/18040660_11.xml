<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a prospective study of 62,095 middle-aged parous women in Shanghai, China, who had no prior history of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> at study recruitment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Breast-feeding history, dietary intake, physical activity and anthropometric measurements were assessed by in-person interviews </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Cox regression model was employed to evaluate the association between breast-feeding and the risk of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 4.6 years of follow-up, 1,561 women were diagnosed with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Women who had breastfed their children tended to have a lower risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> than those who had never breastfed [relative risk (RR)=0.88; 95% CI, 0.76-1.02; p=0.08] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increasing duration of breast-feeding was associated with a reduced risk of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The fully adjusted RRs for lifetime breast-feeding duration were 1.00, 0.88, 0.89, 0.88, 0.75 and 0.68 (p trend=0.01) for 0, &gt;0 to 0.99, &gt;0.99 to 1.99, &gt;1.99 to 2.99, &gt;2.99 to 3.99 and &gt;or=4 years in analyses adjusted for age, daily energy intake, BMI, WHR, smoking, alcohol intake, physical activity, occupation, income level, education level, number of live births and presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Breast-feeding may protect parous women from developing type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> later in life </plain></SENT>
