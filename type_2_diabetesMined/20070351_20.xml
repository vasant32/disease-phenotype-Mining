<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a double-blind study, 1050 treatment-naïve patients (i.e. not taking an antihyperglycaemic agent for &gt; or =16 weeks prior to study entry) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and an HbA(1c) 6.5-9% were randomized (1:1) to treatment with once-daily <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> 100 mg (N = 528) or twice-daily <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> 1000 mg (N = 522) for 24 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> was up-titrated from 500 to 2000 mg per day (or maximum tolerated daily dose &gt; or =1000 mg) over a period of 5 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary analysis used a per-protocol (PP) approach to assess whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> was non-inferior to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> based on HbA(1c) change from baseline at week 24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Non-inferiority was to be declared if the upper boundary of the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the between-group difference in this endpoint was &lt;0.40% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From a mean baseline HbA(1c) of 7.2% in the PP population, HbA(1c) change from baseline was -0.43% with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> (n = 455) and -0.57% with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (n = 439) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The between-group difference (95% CI) was 0.14% (0.06, 0.21), thus confirming non-inferiority </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Baseline HbA(1c) influenced treatment response, with larger reductions in HbA(1c) observed in patients with baseline HbA(1c)&gt; or =8% in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> (-1.13%; n = 74) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (-1.24%; n = 73) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The proportions of patients at week 24 with HbA(1c) values at the goals of &lt;7 or &lt;6.5% were 69 and 34% with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> and 76 and 39% with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> changes from baseline were -11.5 mg/dL (-0.6 mmol/l) and -19.4 mg/dl (-1.1 mmol/l) with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, respectively (difference in LS mean change from baseline [95% CI] = 8.0 mg /dl [4.5,11.4]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both treatments led to similar improvements from baseline in measures of homeostasis model assessment-beta cell function (HOMA-beta) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-IR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> was 1.7% with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> and 3.3% with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (p = 0.116) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The incidence of gastrointestinal-related adverse experiences was substantially lower with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> (11.6%) compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (20.7%) (difference in incidence [95% CI] = -9.1% [-13.6,-4.7]), primarily because of significantly decreased incidences of diarrhoea (3.6 vs. 10.9%; p &lt; 0.001) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> (1.1 vs. 3.1%; p = 0.032) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this 24-week monotherapy study, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> was non-inferior to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> in improving HbA(1c) in treatment-naïve patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Although both treatments were generally well tolerated, a lower incidence of gastrointestinal-related adverse experiences was observed with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
