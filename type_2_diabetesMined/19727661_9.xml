<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Certain types of bariatric surgical procedures have proved not only to be effective with regard to treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, but they also seem to be associated with <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> changes which independently of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> give rise to remission of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Currently, it is speculated that surgical re-routing of nutrients triggers changes in the release of gastrointestine-derived hormones, which in turn cause amelioration of the diabetic state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 'hindgut hypothesis' states that surgical re-routing of nutrients to the distal part of the small intestine results in increased secretion and concomitant <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering effects of glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1, whereas the 'foregut hypothesis' emphasises that surgical bypass of the foregut prevents the release of a hitherto unidentified nutrient-induced diabetogenic signal in susceptible individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have shown that in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, glucagon is differentially secreted in response to oral and i.v. <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, respectively, with lack of suppression (and initial net secretion) during oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> administration and a perfectly <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> suppression during isoglycaemic i.v. <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings could point towards a role for glucagon or gut-derived glucagonotropic signalling as putative diabetogenic signals of the foregut hypothesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the present paper the hypotheses describing the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering mechanisms of bariatric surgical procedures sharing the common feature of a bypass of the duodenum and the proximal jejunum are outlined and a possible role for glucagon in these is proposed </plain></SENT>
