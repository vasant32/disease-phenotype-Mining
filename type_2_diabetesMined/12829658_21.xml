<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma)-2 is a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily that is expressed predominantly in adipocytes and is thought to have a role in energy homeostasis, adipogenesis, and insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A functional single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that predicts a proline to alanine substitution (Pro12Ala) within the coding region of this gene has previously been associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in several populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we identified several novel SNPs in the promoter region of PPARgamma2 and genotyped them, along with the previously identified Pro12Ala SNP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 241 nondiabetic Pima subjects, the Pro12Ala was associated with whole-body insulin action (P = 0.05), hepatic insulin action (P = 0.03), and fasting plasma insulin concentrations (P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One of the promoter SNPs positioned within a putative E2 box was in high linkage disequilibrium (/D'/ = 0.98) with the Pro12Ala </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This promoter SNP was similarly associated with whole-body insulin action (P = 0.04) and hepatic insulin action (P = 0.05), but not fasting plasma insulin concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Functional studies in transfected 3T3-L1 cells demonstrated that this single base substitution in the putative E2 box significantly altered transcriptional activity from a luciferase reporter construct </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that this promoter SNP, via its effect on PPARgamma2 expression, may also have functional consequences on PPARgamma2-activated pathways, and perhaps both the promoter SNP and the Pro12Ala contribute to PPARgamma2-related phenotypes </plain></SENT>
