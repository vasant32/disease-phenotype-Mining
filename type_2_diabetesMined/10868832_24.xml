<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This randomized double-blind placebo-controlled multicenter study was conducted in 289 patients who received either nateglinide at doses of 30 mg (n = 51), 60 mg (n = 58), 120 mg (n = 63), or 180 mg (n = 57) or placebo (n = 60) before three main meals for 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Levels of HbA1c, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24103">fructosamine</z:chebi>, and plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> were measured at predetermined intervals, and the effects of nateglinide on prandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> insulin, C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels were measured after a liquid standard meal (Sustacal; Mead Johnson, Evansville, IN) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adverse events and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001988'>hypoglycemic episodes</z:hpo> were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After a liquid meal challenge, nateglinide rapidly increased mealtime insulin levels within 30 min of drug intake and reduced mealtime <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excursions without affecting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At study end point, reduction of HbA1c levels was statistically significantly greater with nateglinide at doses of 60, 120, and 180 mg than placebo (-0.45, -0.62, and -0.64%, respectively; P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean level of FPG was significantly reduced versus placebo in the nateglinide 120-mg group only (-1.14 mmol/l P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, nateglinide was well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that nateglinide improves mealtime and mean glycemic control in a dose-dependent manner by restoring early insulin secretion phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nateglinide was well tolerated and is suitable for the treatment of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
