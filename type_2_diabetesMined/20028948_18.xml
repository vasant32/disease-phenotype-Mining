<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined whether exercise training could restore <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> function and insulin sensitivity in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Eighteen male type 2 diabetic and 20 healthy male control subjects of comparable body weight, BMI, age, and VO2max participated in a 12-week combined progressive training program (three times per week and 45 min per session) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In vivo <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> function (assessed via magnetic resonance spectroscopy), insulin sensitivity (clamp), metabolic flexibility (indirect calorimetry), and IMCL content (histochemically) were measured before and after training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>Mitochondrial</z:hpo> function was lower in type 2 diabetic compared with control subjects (P = 0.03), improved by training in control subjects (28% increase; P = 0.02), and restored to control values in type 2 diabetic subjects (48% increase; P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity tended to improve in control subjects (delta Rd 8% increase; P = 0.08) and improved significantly in type 2 diabetic subjects (delta Rd 63% increase; P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Suppression of insulin-stimulated endogenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production improved in both groups (-64%; P &lt; 0.01 in control subjects and -52% in diabetic subjects; P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After training, metabolic flexibility in type 2 diabetic subjects was restored (delta respiratory exchange ratio 63% increase; P = 0.01) but was unchanged in control subjects (delta respiratory exchange ratio 7% increase; P = 0.22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Starting with comparable pretraining IMCL levels, training tended to increase IMCL content in type 2 diabetic subjects (27% increase; P = 0.10), especially in type 2 muscle fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Exercise training restored in vivo <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> function in type 2 diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Insulin-mediated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal and metabolic flexibility improved in type 2 diabetic subjects in the face of near-significantly increased IMCL content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This indicates that increased capacity to store IMCL and restoration of improved <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> function contribute to improved muscle insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
