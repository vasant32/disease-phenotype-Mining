<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To validate and apply a method for independent assessment of insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity (S(I)) during the same test; that is, an intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test followed by a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp, also called the Botnia clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This test was then applied to nondiabetic subjects with (FH+) and without (FH-) a first-degree family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The Botnia clamp measures the first-phase insulin response (FPIR) to 0.3g/kg <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> i.v. and insulin sensitivity (M-value) from a 2-h euglycemic clamp begun 60 min after the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> bolus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The M-value obtained during the Botnia clamp was compared with M-values obtained during a regular euglycemic clamp without prior <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> bolus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Repeated tests were performed in random order in subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001952'>abnormal glucose tolerance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, the test was applied to subjects with and without a family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: S(I) and insulin secretion from this test showed a high degree of reproducibility, and the M-value obtained with the Botnia clamp correlated strongly with the M-value from a euglycemic clamp without prior <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> bolus (r = 0.953, P &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FH+ subjects showed decreased S(I) (P = 0.02), but similar FPIR, compared with FH- subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, insulin secretion adjusted for the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> was significantly impaired (P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the Botnia clamp provides reliable and independent measures of S(I) and beta-cell function during the same test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As illustrated above, knowledge of the degree of S(I) is mandatory when presenting data on insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
