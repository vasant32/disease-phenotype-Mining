<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-six Japanese type 2 diabetic patients (T2DM) and 39 healthy control subjects were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed clinical parameters, urinary albumin excretion rate (AER), brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV), intima media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) and serum levels of proinflammatory molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum levels of IL-6, IP-10 and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 were significantly higher in T2DM than in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In T2DM, serum levels of high-sensitivity (hs) CRP, IP-10, hsTNF-alpha, VCAM-1 and E-selectin were positively correlated with AER </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of IP-10, hsTNF-alpha and VCAM-1 were positively correlated with baPWV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of hsCRP, IL-6, IP-10 and hsTNF-alpha were positively correlated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that serum levels of hsTNF-alpha were independently associated with AER (beta=0.235, P=0.038) and serum levels of IP-10 were independently associated with baPWV (beta=0.209, P=0.047) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> (beta=0.303, P=0.032) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that low-grade <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, microinflammation, may be a common risk factor for diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in Japanese type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
