<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Epidemiological observations have suggested a relationship between type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birth weight</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there are many confounding variables and problems with retrospective data collection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> mellitus (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e>), who are likely to develop type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the future, may help clarify these observations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Consecutive women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> (n = 138) were included in the study if they had a singleton pregnancy delivered between 37 and 41 weeks of gestation, if they had themselves been born in the local hospital, and if their own delivery data were available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With respect to their own births, a matched group was obtained by considering the next female delivery of the same gestational age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e>, the mean (+/- 1 SD) birth weight was 3,293 +/- 493 g and the ponderal index was 27.0 +/- 2.4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Their values were not significantly different from the matched group, which had a birth weight of 3,315 +/- 460 g and a ponderal index of 27.0 +/- 2.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for the gestational age of delivery, the birth weight of women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> did not show a U-shaped distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: After adjustment for the gestational age of delivery, women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> do not themselves have either a lower or higher birth weight than a matched group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> are either not a good surrogate for investigating the relationship between birth weight and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or that correction for the gestational age of delivery removes the most important confounding variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is also possible that modern dietary changes may have altered the relationship </plain></SENT>
