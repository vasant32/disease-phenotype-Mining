<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Reduction of bone marrow-derived circulating progenitor cells has been proposed as a novel mechanism of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to describe the extent and potential mechanisms of progenitor cell reduction during the natural history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We identified 425 individuals, divided into seven categories according to carbohydrate metabolism status (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance [NGT], impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> [IGT], and newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration (0-9, 10-19, and &gt;or=20 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These categories were examined as ideally describing the natural history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> development and progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We measured CD34+ and CD34+KDR+ progenitor cells by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also evaluated progenitor cells in 20 coupled bone marrow and peripheral blood samples and examined progenitor cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in 34 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In comparison to NGT, CD34+ cells were significantly reduced in IGT and had a first nadir in newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and a second nadir after 20 years of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Statistical adjustment for possible confounders confirmed that CD34+ cell counts are deeply reduced at time of diagnosis, that they partially recover during the subsequent 0-19 years, and that they dip again after &gt;or=20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A similar, but less consistent, trend was detected for CD34+KDR+ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood CD34+ cells were directly correlated with bone marrow CD34+ cells and inversely correlated with CD34+ cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Circulating progenitor cell reduction marks the clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Both defective mobilization and <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> may account for this phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>While a partial recovery occurs during subsequent years, bone marrow reserve seems exhausted in the long term </plain></SENT>
