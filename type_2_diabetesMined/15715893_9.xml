<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo> and its most severe form type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> are rapidly increasing throughout the world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is generally recognized that <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33243">natural products</z:chebi> with a long history of safety can increase insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The present investigation examined the ability of various combinations of essential oils such as fenugreek, cinnamon, cumin, oregano, etc. to enhance insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As a first approximation, we examined the effects of these <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33243">natural products</z:chebi> on <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> fatty rats (ZFRs), a model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), a model of genetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Water or essential oils were given orally via droplets, and insulin sensitivity was estimated by systolic blood pressure (SBP) changes and circulating <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and/or insulin concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We have found that the ability to alter SBP in rat models is the most sensitive early index of insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The combined essential oils lowered circulating <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels and SBP in both ZFRs and SHRs, suggesting that these <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33243">natural products</z:chebi> are enhancing insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The second series of studies examined two additional combinations of essential oils along with the original formula </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The major differences were in the types and proportions of individual oils contributing to a given formula </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the three formulae decreased SBP in ZFRs, one of the formulae was more effective than the others in lowering circulating <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, some essential oils may be added to the long list of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33243">natural products</z:chebi> that can affect insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
