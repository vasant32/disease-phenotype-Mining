<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We functionally characterized human islets to determine secretory, biophysical, and ultrastructural features in relation to genetic risk profiles in diabetic and nondiabetic donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Islets from donors with T2D exhibited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948379" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">impaired insulin secretion</z:e>, which was more pronounced in lean than <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> diabetic donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We assessed the impact of 14 disease susceptibility variants on measures of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> sensing, exocytosis, and structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Variants near TCF7L2 and ADRA2A were associated with reduced <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced insulin secretion, whereas susceptibility variants near ADRA2A, KCNJ11, KCNQ1, and TCF7L2 were associated with reduced depolarization-evoked insulin exocytosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>KCNQ1, ADRA2A, KCNJ11, HHEX/IDE, and SLC2A2 variants affected granule docking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We combined our results to create a novel genetic risk score for β-cell dysfunction that includes aberrant granule docking, decreased Ca(2+) sensitivity of exocytosis, and reduced insulin release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Individuals with a high risk score displayed an impaired response to intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and deteriorating insulin secretion over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results underscore the importance of defects in β-cell exocytosis in T2D and demonstrate the potential of cellular phenotypic characterization in the elucidation of complex <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
