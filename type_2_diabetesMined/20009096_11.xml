<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE This study examines the usefulness of childhood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis variables (<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> index [homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> {HOMA-IR}]) in predicting pre-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and related cardiometabolic risk factors in adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS This retrospective cohort study consisted of normoglycemic (n = 1,058), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pre-diabetic</z:e> (n = 37), and type 2 diabetic (n = 25) adults aged 19-39 years who were followed on average for 17 years since childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS At least 50% of the individuals who ranked highest (top quintile) in childhood for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis variables maintained their high rank by being above the 60th percentile in adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate model, the best predictors of adulthood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis variables were the change in BMI Z score from childhood to adulthood and childhood BMI Z score, followed by the corresponding childhood levels of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, and HOMA-IR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further, children in the top decile versus the rest for insulin and HOMA-IR were 2.85 and 2.55 times, respectively, more likely to develop pre-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; children in the top decile versus the rest for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, and HOMA-IR were 3.28, 5.54, and 5.84 times, respectively, more likely to develop <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, independent of change in BMI Z score, baseline BMI Z score, and total-to-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, children with adverse levels (top quintile versus the rest) of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis variables displayed significantly higher prevalences of, among others, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002155'>hypertriglyceridemia</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS Adverse levels of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis variables in childhood not only persist into adulthood but also predict adult pre-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and relate to cardiometabolic risk factors </plain></SENT>
