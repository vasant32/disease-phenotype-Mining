<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were randomised as follows: group 1, insulin-based treatment; group 2, insulin during hospitalisation followed by conventional <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control; and group 3, conventional treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment according to the above protocol lasted 2.1 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using the total DIGAMI 2 cohort as an epidemiological database, this study presents mortality rates in the randomised groups, and mortality and morbidity rates by <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering treatment during an extended period of follow-up (median 4.1 and max 8.1 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Follow-up data were available in 1,145 of the 1,253 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mortality rate was 31% (72% cardiovascular) without significant differences between treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The total number of fatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> was 37, with a trend towards a higher risk in group 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The HR for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from malignant disease, compared with group 2, was 1.77 (95% CI 0.87-3.61; p = 0.11) and 3.60 (95% CI 1.24-10.50; p = 0.02) compared with group 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Insulin treatment was associated with non-fatal cardiovascular events (OR 1.89 95% CI 1.35-2.63; p = 0.0002), but not with mortality (OR 1.30, 95% CI 0.93-1.81; p = 0.13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> was associated with a lower mortality rate (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.47-0.90; p = 0.01) and a lower risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> (HR 0.25, 95% CI 0.08-0.83; p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Insulin may be associated with an increased risk of non-fatal cardiac events, while <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> seems to be protective against risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
