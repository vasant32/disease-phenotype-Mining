<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed the associations of variants in the adiponectin gene (ADIPOQ) with circulating adiponectin levels and cardiovascular risk among women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of 989 diabetic women from the Nurses' Health Study, 285 developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) during follow-up through 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We genotyped five ADIPOQ polymorphisms in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> case and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A promoter polymorphism -11365C--&gt;G was significantly associated with lower plasma adiponectin levels (P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The homozygotes of allele -4034C were significantly associated with approximately 60% increased cardiovascular risk (odds ratio 1.62 [95% CI 1.07-2.45]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adjustment for age, BMI, and other covariates did not appreciably change the associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, a common haplotype possessing allele +276T (CAATT) was associated with a significantly lower <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk than the most common haplotype (CAATG) (0.70 [0.50-0.98]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In our meta-analysis of 827 CVD case and 1,887 CVD-free control subjects, polymorphism +276G--&gt;T was significantly associated with approximately 45% (20-62%) decreased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk under a recessive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> mode in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, ADIPOQ promoter polymorphism -11365C--&gt;G was associated with plasma adiponectin levels, whereas polymorphisms -4034A--&gt;C and +276G--&gt;T were associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
