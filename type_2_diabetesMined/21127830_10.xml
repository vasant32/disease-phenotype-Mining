<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science were searched for articles assessing the association between genes and diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> genetic variants statistically associated with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in an initial study, then independently reproduced in at least one additional study, were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studies assessing these variants were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The association between these variants and diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> (defined as macroalbuminuria/<z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal disease</z:hpo> [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e>]) was calculated at the allele level and the main measure of effect was a pooled odds ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pre-specified subgroup analyses were performed, stratifying for type 1/type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e> and ethnic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The literature search yielded 3,455 citations, of which 671 were genetic association studies investigating diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We identified 34 replicated genetic variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of these, 21 remained significantly associated with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in a random-effects meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These variants were in or near the following genes: ACE, AKR1B1 (two variants), APOC1, APOE, EPO, NOS3 (two variants), HSPG2, VEGFA, FRMD3 (two variants), CARS (two variants), UNC13B, CPVL and CHN2, and GREM1, plus four variants not near genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The odds ratios of associated genetic variants ranged from 0.48 to 1.70 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Additional variants were detected in subgroup analyses: ELMO1 (Asians), CCR5 (Asians) and CNDP1 (type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: This meta-analysis found 24 genetic variants associated with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The relative contribution and relevance of the identified genes in the pathogenesis of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> should be the focus of future studies </plain></SENT>
