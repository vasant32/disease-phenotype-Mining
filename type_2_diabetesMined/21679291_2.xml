<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of initiating and titrating a single bolus dose of insulin glulisine to baseline insulin glargine plus oral hypoglycaemic agents (OHAs) was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a 6-month, parallel-group, randomized, open-label, Phase IV study conducted in the US, UK and Russia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>People with T2DM (HbA(1c) 7.5-9.5%) using any basal insulin underwent a 3-month run-in period on insulin glargine titrated to optimize fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (BG) control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Those with HbA(1c) &gt;7.0% were randomized to either continue prior therapy (n = 57) or to add a single dose of insulin glulisine (n = 49) immediately prior to the main meal for a further 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two different titration algorithms were employed for the bolus dose, targeting 2-h postprandial BG ≤135 mg/dL (≤7.5 mmol/l; Russia and UK) or pre-meal/bedtime BG 100-120 mg/dl (5.5-6.7 mmol/l; US) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HbA(1c) and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels decreased during the run-in period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the 3 months after randomization, more participants in the basal-plus-bolus group reached HbA(1c) &lt;7.0% than the basal-only control group (22.4 vs. 8.8%; p &lt; 0.05), with significantly greater reduction of HbA(1c) (-0.37 vs. -0.11%; p = 0.0290) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> and mean weight change were comparable between the treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In people with T2DM inadequately controlled on basal insulin plus OHAs, adding a single injection of insulin glulisine prior to the main meal significantly improves <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control without undesired side effects </plain></SENT>
