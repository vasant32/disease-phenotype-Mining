<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A trial tissue was obtained from 19 diabetic (Type 2) and 43 non-diabetic patients undergoing coronary surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Endogenous <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> release was examined under baseline conditions as well as during electrical field stimulation (effective voltage 5 V, stimulation frequency 4 Hz, pulse width 2 msec) by high performance liquid chromatography and electrochemical detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cardiac function and arterial blood pressure was assessed from coronary angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In atrial tissue from diabetic patients, stimulation-induced <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> release was reduced by 25% compared with non-diabetic patients, while baseline <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> release did not differ between both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Preoperative plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1C) concentrations were increased in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, however, no relation was found to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Diabetic and non-diabetic patients did not differ regarding left ventricular ejection fraction and arterial blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: Cardiac <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> release is suppressed in patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> which could contribute to sympathetic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The difference of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> release in diabetic and non-diabetic patients was independent of cardiac function and arterial blood pressure </plain></SENT>
