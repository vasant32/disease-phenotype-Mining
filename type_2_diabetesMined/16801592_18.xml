<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the current study was to investigate whether ADIPOQ gene variants in the promoter region predict adiponectin levels and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 550 subjects with increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were investigated; they underwent a 75-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test, repeated after 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adiponectin levels were analyzed, and two ADIPOQ promoter variant single nucleotide polymorphisms, -11391G&gt;A and -11377C&gt;G, were genotyped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Tertiles of the adjusted adiponectin levels were associated with single nucleotide polymorphism -11391G&gt;A and -11377C&gt;G haplotypes (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Carriers of the intermediate/high-level haplotype combination showed a bisected <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk at the 3-year follow-up and were characterized by a "regression" of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Evolution of disease status correlates with preexisting low adiponectin levels at inclusion rather than with variation in adiponectin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We present data that gene variants in the ADIPOQ promoter region are associated with variations in adiponectin levels and thus with future type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and disease progression </plain></SENT>
