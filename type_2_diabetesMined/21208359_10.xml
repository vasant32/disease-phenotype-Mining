<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Incretin-based therapies, such as the injectable glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> and orally administered dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, have recently been introduced into clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At present, the GLP-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> need to be administered once or twice daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several once-weekly GLP-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> are in phase 3 development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This review examines the efficacy, safety and perspective for the future of the once-weekly GLP-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi>: exenatide once weekly, taspoglutide, albiglutide, LY2189265 and CJC-1134-PC, and compared them to the currently available <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi>, exenatide BID and liraglutide QD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A greater reduction in <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA1c) and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was found with the once-weekly GLP-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> compared with exenatide BID, while the effect on postprandial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> was modest with the once-weekly GLP-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The reduction in HbA1c was in most studies greater compared to oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs and insulin glargine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The reduction in weight did not differ between the short- and long-acting <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The gastrointestinal side effects were less with the once-weekly <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> compared with exenatide BID, except for taspoglutide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Antibodies seem to be most frequent with exenatide once weekly, while hypersensitivity has been described in few patients treated with taspoglutide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Injection site reactions differ among the long-acting GLP-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> and are observed more frequently than with exenatide BID and liraglutide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In humans, no signal has been found indicating an association between the once-weekly <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> and C-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The cardiovascular safety, durability of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control and effect on weight will emerge from several ongoing major long-term trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The once-weekly GLP-1 receptor analogues are promising candidates for the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, although their efficacy may not be superior to once-daily analogue liraglutide </plain></SENT>
