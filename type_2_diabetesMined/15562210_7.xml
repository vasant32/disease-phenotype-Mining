<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of sympathetic versus parasympathetic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> among type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: There were 43 patients with type 1 and 17 with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sympathetic nerve function was assessed by measurement of the vasoconstriction (VAC) index by laser Doppler perfusion imaging of a locally heated finger followed by indirect cooling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Parasympathetic nerve function was assessed by R-R interval variation during deep breathing as measured by the expiration/inspiration (E/I) ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results were expressed as age-corrected z scores in SD; VAC index &gt;1.64 SD and E/I ratio &lt;-1.64 SD were considered abnormal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: VAC index was abnormal in 40% with type 1 and 41% with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, whereas the E/I ratio was abnormal in 42% with type 1 and 65% with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a clear association between VAC index and E/I ratio among type 1 (rs=0.525; P=0.0002) but not among type 2 (rs=0.10) diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among type 2 diabetic patients, the degree of dysfunction was most severe regarding parasympathetic function (P=0.0167) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Sympathetic and parasympathetic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> were frequent in both type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, there was a difference between the two types of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve functions correlated in type 1 but not in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The explanation for this discrepancy might be that parasympathetic nerve function was most severely affected among type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
