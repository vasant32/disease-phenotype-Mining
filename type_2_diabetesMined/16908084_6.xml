<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined whether macrophages from men and women with Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) exhibited differences in expression of key genes involved in fatty acid metabolism and in fatty acid composition compared with macrophages from non-diabetic controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood monocytes from subjects with T2DM (n=9) and non-diabetic controls (n=10) were differentiated into macrophages in 10% autologous serum and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (5mM) or high (22mM) <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Levels of PPARalpha, PPARgamma, LXRalpha, SCD and ABCA1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> were similar in macrophages from subjects with T2DM and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 5mM <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, macrophage <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28842">stearic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28842">C18:0</z:chebi>) was 12.6+/-1.0% of total fatty acids for T2DM compared with 18.1+/-2.0% for controls (p=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Macrophage <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17351">linoleic acid</z:chebi> (C18:2) was 15.5+/-0.8% for T2DM and 9.3+/-2.0% for controls (p=0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ratio of macrophage <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28842">stearic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28842">C18:0</z:chebi>)/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16196">oleic acid</z:chebi> (C18:1) was 0.29 [0.25,0.48] for T2DM versus 0.54 [0.36,0.82] for controls (p=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with non-diabetic controls, macrophages from men and women with T2DM had significantly different fatty acid profiles consistent with increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15541">stearoyl-CoA</z:chebi> desaturase (SCD) activity and increased C18:2 accumulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This pattern of altered macrophage fatty acid composition may be relevant to diabetic atherogenesis </plain></SENT>
