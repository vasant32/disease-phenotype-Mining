<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Since there is no agreement on regimens of self-monitoring of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (SMBG) in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> not on insulin, we evaluated the effects of a simple SMBG policy taking into account compliance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: 273 type 2 diabetic patients not on insulin with HbA1c &gt;7% attending our <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Clinic and already using SMBG were randomized as follows: Group A, one BG profile/month with fasting and post-prandial values; Group B, one BG profile every 2 weeks with pre- and post-prandial values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed-up by the same team every 3 months with the same education and treatment policies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 3 and 6 months, SMBG profiles were evaluated and HbA1c measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SMBG was carried out as recommended by 73% of Group A and 44% of Group B patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In compliant patients, HbA1c and BG were unchanged in Group A whereas in Group B fasting, pre-prandial and two out of three post-prandial BG values were reduced and HbA1c decreased from 8.09+/-0.84% to 7.60+/-0.73% (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The influence on BG control was similar for the two policies when compliance was not considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The more intensive SMBG policy considered is associated with improvements in glycaemic control in compliant subjects </plain></SENT>
