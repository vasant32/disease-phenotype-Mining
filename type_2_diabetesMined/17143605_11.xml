<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Persons aged 40-69 years were screened for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> based on a high-risk, stepwise strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At baseline, anthropometric measurements, blood samples and questionnaire data were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 1,160 persons had IFG or IGT at baseline: 811 (70%) accepted re-examination after 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> tolerance classification was based on the 1999 WHO definition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At follow-up, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was based on one diabetic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> value of fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> or 2-h blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, 308 persons had IFG and 503 had IGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 17.6 and 18.8 per 100 person-years in the two groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: IFG and IGT identified in general practice during a stepwise, high-risk screening programme for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have high 1-year progression rates to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Consequently, intensive follow-up and intervention strategies are recommended for these high-risk individuals </plain></SENT>
