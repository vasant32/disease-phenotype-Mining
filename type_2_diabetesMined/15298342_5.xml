<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Abdominal, subcutaneous adipose tissue and splanchnic <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism were studied by conducting measurements of arterio-venous concentrations and regional blood flow in six overweight Type 2 diabetic subjects before, during and after exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Exercise induced an increase in adipose tissue lipolysis and fatty acid release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the increase in adipose tissue blood flow was small, limiting fatty acid mobilisation from this tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Some of the fatty acids were released in excess in the post-exercise phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The splanchnic fatty acid uptake was unchanged during the experiment but splanchnic ketogenesis increased in the post-exercise phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The arterial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration decreased during exercise and continued to decrease afterwards, indicating an imbalance between splanchnic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production and whole-body <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Regional subcutaneous, abdominal adipose tissue lipolysis is no higher in patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than in young, healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Exercise stimulates adipose tissue lipolysis, but due to an insufficient increase in blood flow, a high fraction of the fatty acids liberated by lipolysis cannot be released to the blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Splanchnic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> release is smaller than whole-body <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilisation during exercise and post-exercise recovery </plain></SENT>
