<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility genes through a genome-wide association scan (GWAS) in the Amish </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: DNA from 124 type 2 diabetic case subjects and 295 control subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance were genotyped on the Affymetrix 100K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 82,485 SNPs were tested for association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-associated SNPs were further prioritized by the following: 1) associations with 5 oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) traits in 427 nondiabetic Amish subjects, and 2) in silico replication from three independent 100L SNP GWASs (Framingham Heart Study Caucasians, Pima Indians, and Mexican Americans) and a 500K GWAS in Scandinavians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The strongest association (P = 1.07 x 10(-5)) was for rs2237457, which is located in growth factor receptor-bound protein 10 (Grb10), an adaptor protein that regulate insulin receptor signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>rs2237457 was also strongly associated with OGTT <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> area under the curve in nondiabetic subjects (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 1,093 SNPs associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at P &lt; 0.01, 67 SNPs demonstrated associations with at least one OGTT trait in nondiabetic individuals; 80 SNPs were nominally associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in one of the three independent 100K GWASs, 3 SNPs (rs2540317 in MFSD9, rs10515353 on chromosome 5, and rs2242400 in BCAT1 were associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in more than one population), and 11 SNPs were nominally associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Scandinavians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-associated SNP (rs3845971, located in FHIT) showed replication with OGTT traits and also in another population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our GWAS of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> identified several gene variants associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, some of which are worthy of further study </plain></SENT>
