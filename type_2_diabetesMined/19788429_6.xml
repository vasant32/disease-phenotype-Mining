<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using the administrative databases of Saskatchewan Health, 12272 new users of oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> therapy were identified between 1991 and 1996 and grouped according to cumulative insulin exposure based on total insulin dispensations per year: no exposure (reference group); low exposure (0 to &lt;3); moderate exposure (3 to &lt;12) and high exposure (&gt; or =12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Time-varying multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the relationship between insulin exposure and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause, CV-related and non-vascular mortality after adjustment for demographics, medications and comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Average age was 65 (s.d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>13.9) years, 45% were female, and mean follow-up was 5.1 (s.d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>2.2) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In total, 1443 (12%) subjects started insulin, and 2681 (22%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The highest mortality rates were in the high exposure group; 95 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>/1000 person-years compared with 40 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>/1000 person-years in the no exposure group [unadjusted hazard ratio (HR): 2.32; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.96-2.73] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After adjustment, we observed a graded risk of mortality associated with increasing exposure to insulin: low exposure [adjusted HR (aHR): 1.75; 95% CI: 1.24-2.47], moderate exposure (aHR: 2.18; 1.82-2.60) and high exposure (aHR: 2.79; 2.36-3.30); p = 0.005 for trend </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Analyses restricted to CV-related (p = 0.042 for trend) and non-vascular (p = 0.004 for trend) mortality showed virtually identical results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We observed a significant and graded association between mortality risk and insulin exposure level in an inception cohort of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> that persisted despite multivariable adjustment </plain></SENT>
