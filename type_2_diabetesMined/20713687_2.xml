<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Physical activity may modify the association of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the independent and joint association of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> and physical activity with fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a Chinese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Middle-aged and older Chinese (n=28,946, â‰¥50 years, 72.4%women) from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study were examined in 2003-2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariable regression was used in a cross-sectional analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BMI, waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) were positively associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after multiple adjustment, most strongly for WHR with odds ratio (OR) of 3.99 (95% CI 3.60-4.42) for highest compared with lowest tertile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lack of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, but not walking, was associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with an OR of 1.29 (1.17-1.41) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The association of moderate-to-vigorous activity with fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> varied with WHR tertiles (P=0.01 for interaction) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Within the high WHR tertile, participants who had a lack of moderate-to-vigorous activity had an OR of 3.87 (3.22-4.65) for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, whereas those who were active had an OR of 2.94 (2.41-3.59) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this population, WHR was a better measure of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e>-related <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk than BMI or waist circumference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Higher moderate-to-vigorous activity was associated with lower <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk, especially in abdominally <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals </plain></SENT>
