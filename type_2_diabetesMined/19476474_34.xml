<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of multiple oral doses of the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor linagliptin (BI 1356) in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-seven male type 2 diabetic patients received linagliptin 1, 2.5, 5 or 10 mg, or placebo, once daily for 12 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Linagliptin exposure [area under the plasma concentration-time curve and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax)] increased less than proportionally with dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Accumulation half-life was short (8.6-23.9 h), resulting in rapid attainment of steady state (2-5 days) and little accumulation (range: 1.18-2.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The long terminal half-life (113-131 h) led to a sustained inhibition of DPP-4 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Renal excretion was below 1% on day 1 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> dose groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of plasma DPP-4 activity correlated well with linagliptin plasma concentrations, resulting in DPP-4 inhibition &gt;90% in the two highest dose groups; even 24 h postdose, DPP-4 inhibition was &gt;80% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Following an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test, 24 h after the last dose, statistically significant reductions of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excursions were observed with linagliptin (2.5, 5 and 10 mg doses) compared with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Linagliptin was well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The frequency of adverse events (AEs) was not higher with linagliptin (54%) than with placebo (75%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No serious AEs and no episodes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In type 2 diabetic patients, multiple rising doses of linagliptin were well tolerated and resulted in significant improvements of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Together with the favourable pharmacokinetics, these results confirm the unique profile of linagliptin in the DPP-4 inhibitor class </plain></SENT>
