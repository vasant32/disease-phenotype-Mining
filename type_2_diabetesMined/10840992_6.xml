<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The present investigation used data from the Verona <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study to verify a main assumption of the capture-recapture method (source independence) and to characterize the subgroup of known diabetic patients missed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sources whose number is estimated by the capture-recapture method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The Verona <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study identified 7,148 type 2 diabetic patients on 31 December 1986 using 3 different sources: family physicians, a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> center, and a drug prescription database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Completeness of ascertainment was estimated with traditional methods based on the hypergeometric distribution and with a log-linear model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Identification sources were not independent because the drug prescription database was positively related to family physicians and negatively related to the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> center (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, completeness of ascertainment was overestimated (87.5% [95% CI 86.3-88.8]) when using only family physicians and the drug prescription database and underestimated (45.9% [43.9-48.1]) when using only the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> center and the drug prescription database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because of characteristics contributing to variable "catchability" (probability of ascertainment), the estimated proportion of ascertainment increased with increasing time since diagnosis from 65.6% in the first tertile (&lt;6 years) to 91.5% in the third tertile (&gt;12 years); moreover, the ascertainment was estimated to be nearly complete (97.9%) for insulin-treated patients and scanty (28.9%) for diet-treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Because identification sources are likely to be dependent, the capture-recapture method should be used with caution in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> epidemiology and possibly when at least 3 sources are available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The subgroup of diabetic patients whose existence is inferred by this technique likely consists of newly diagnosed patients with mild disease severity </plain></SENT>
