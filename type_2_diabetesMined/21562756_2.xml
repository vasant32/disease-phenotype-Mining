<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>APPL1 is present in C2C12 myoblasts and mouse skeletal muscle, but its presence in human skeletal muscle has not been investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Samples from type 2 diabetic, and lean and non-diabetic <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> participants were analysed by: immunoprecipitation and western blot; HPLC-electrospray ionisation (ESI)-mass spectrometry (MS) analysis; peak area analysis by MS; HPLC-ESI-MS/MS/MS analysis; and RT-PCR analysis of APPL1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Immunoprecipitation and western blot indicated a band specific to APPL1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tryptic digestion and HPLC-ESI-MS analysis of whole-muscle homogenate APPL1 unambiguously identified APPL1 with 56% sequence coverage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Peak area analysis by MS validated western blot results, showing APPL1 levels to be significantly increased in type 2 diabetic and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> as compared with lean participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Targeted phosphopeptide analysis by HPLC-ESI-MS/MS/MS showed that APPL1 was phosphorylated specifically on Ser(401) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>APPL1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was significantly increased in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and type 2 diabetic participants as compared with lean participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After bariatric surgery in morbidly <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> participants with subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, skeletal muscle APPL1 abundance was significantly reduced (p &lt; 0.05) in association with an increase in plasma adiponectin (p &lt; 0.01), increased levels of ADIPOR1 (p &lt; 0.05) and increased muscle <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: APPL1 abundance is significantly higher in type 2 diabetic muscle; APPL1 is phosphorylated in vivo on Ser(401) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Improvements in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> and hypoadiponectinaemia following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> are associated with reduced skeletal muscle APPL1, and increased plasma adiponectin levels and muscle AMPK phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
