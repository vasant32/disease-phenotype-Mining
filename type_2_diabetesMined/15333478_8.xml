<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to characterize the distribution of the rate of change of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> for a diabetic population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study population consisted of 124 adults with type 1 or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> requiring insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Study participants applied a GlucoWatch Biographer during the day at home for 5 consecutive days and took finger-prick blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> measurements hourly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects kept a diary of meals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Biographer frequently and automatically measured <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> up to three times per hour for up 12 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rates of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> change were calculated for both Biographer and blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rates of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> change during a separate study of 134 subjects were determined for daytime and nighttime use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: -Mean (+/-SD) rates of change of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> of -0.36 +/- 0.95 and 0.36 +/- 0.99 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>dl(-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>min(-1) were found before and after lunch using blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> data and -0.31 +/- 1.23 and 0.43 +/- 1.26 using Biographer data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For both types of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, rates of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> change exceeded 2 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>dl(-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>min(-1) before and after meals approximately 10% of the time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Periprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> patterns showed some significant differences between type 1 and type 2 diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> levels changed more gradually at night than during the day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> values were almost equally unstable before and after meals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Glycemic instability around dinner was different in type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The GlucoWatch Biographer was found to be effective in tracking trends in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels and yielded similar results as obtained by finger-prick blood samples </plain></SENT>
