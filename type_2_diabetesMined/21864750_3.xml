<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta-cell dysfunction</z:hpo> determines the course of the disease, regardless of the treatment used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is mounting evidence that chronically elevated circulating levels of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and fatty acids contribute to relentless beta-cell function decline, by endorsing processes commonly referred to as glucolipotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mechanisms related to glucolipotoxicity include endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction and islet <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most commonly prescribed blood-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> lowering agents, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and sul-fonylurea, may temporarily improve glycaemic control, however, these drugs do not alter the continuous decline in beta-cell function in T2DM patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Evidence exists that novel classes of drugs, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> (TZDs) and incretin-based therapies, may be able to preserve beta-cell function and functional beta-cell mass, amongst others by reducing glucolipotoxicity in the beta cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The durability of the effects of TZDs and incretin-based therapies on beta-cell function, whether given as monotherapy or combined with other treatment, should be addressed in future, long-term clinical studies </plain></SENT>
