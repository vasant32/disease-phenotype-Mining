<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: There is considerable interindividual variation in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> response in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) variants have been identified to be strongly associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk, probably due to decreased beta-cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that variation in TCF7L2 would influence response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> but not <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied the effect of TCF7L2 rs12255372 and rs7903146 genotypes on glycemic response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The DARTS/MEMO (<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Audit and Research Tayside/Medicines Monitoring Unit) collaboration database includes prescribing, biochemistry, and clinical phenotype of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> within Tayside, Scotland, from 1992 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these, the TCF7L2 genotype was determined in 4,469 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> recruited to GoDARTS (Genetics of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Audit and Research Tayside) between 1997 and July 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 901 incident <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> users and 945 metformin users were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A logistic regression was used with treatment failure defined as an A1C &gt;7% within 3-12 months after treatment initiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Covariates included the TCF7L2 genotype, BMI, sex, age diagnosed, drug adherence, and drug dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A1C pretreatment was available in a subset of patients (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> n = 579; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> n = 755) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Carriers of the risk allele were less likely to respond to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> with an odds ratio (OR) for failure of 1.95 (95% CI 1.23-3.06; P = 0.005), comparing rs12255372 T/T vs. G/G </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Including the baseline A1C strengthened this association (OR 2.16 [95% CI 1.21-3.86], P = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A similar, although slightly weaker, association was seen with rs7903146 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No association was seen between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> response and either single nucleotide polymorphism, after adjustment for baseline A1C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TCF7L2 variants influence therapeutic response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> but not <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This study establishes that genetic variation can alter response to therapy in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
