<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite the fact that there are indications of common aetiological features of T1DM and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2DM), variation in genes involved in insulin secretion and insulin signalling has to a large extent been ignored as potential modifiers in the pathogenesis of T1DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent studies suggest, however, that proven T2DM susceptibility gene variants may be involved in the pathogenesis of T1DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to estimate the impact of four selected amino acid polymorphisms -IRS-1 Gly972Arg, Kir6.2 Glu23Lys, HNF-1alpha Ala98Val and PPARgamma2 Pro12Ala in a Danish population of T1DM families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> variants were genotyped in 490 simplex- and multiplex-T1DM families applying polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism, and results were evaluated by means of a transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TDT analysis revealed that the Arg972 IRS-1, the Lys23 Kir6.2 and the Val98 HNF-1alpha variants were transmitted from heterozygous parents to affected probands at frequencies of 49.1%, 47.0% and 54.1%, respectively (p &gt; 0.05 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was similar to the rate of transmission to unaffected siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The transmission rate of the Ala12 PPARgamma2 variant to affected probands was 46.5% (p &gt; 0.05) which differed significantly from the transmission to unaffected offspring (p = 0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A combined analysis of the present and published pertinent data of 1691 transmissions showed a significantly decreased transmission of the PPARgamma2 Ala12 allele to affected probands (p = 0.0045) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The Pro12Ala variant of PPARgamma2 is associated with T1DM, the minor Ala allele conferring a reduced risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This same finding has been reported in patients with T2DM </plain></SENT>
