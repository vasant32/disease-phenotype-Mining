<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This cross-sectional study comprised 2152 men and 3143 women (43-66 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test identified 316 men and 213 women with previously unknown impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (IFG), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT), IFG+IGT, or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Personality traits antagonism (low agreeableness), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100710'>impulsivity</z:hpo> (low conscientiousness), hedonic capacity (high extraversion), negative affectivity (high <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027932" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">neuroticism</z:e>) and alexithymia (low openness) were measured by a self-report inventory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on distribution of scores, responses were divided into "low" (&lt;1 SD), "middle" (Â±1 SD) and "high" (&gt;1 SD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Middle groups were considered reference groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prevalence odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In men, OR for low antagonism was 0.3 (CI 0.2-0.6) (age- and multi-adjusted models) while in women, neither high nor low antagonism was associated to abnormal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Men and women with high hedonic capacity had ORs 0.5 (0.3-0.9) and 0.6 (0.4-1.0), respectively (age- and multi-adjusted models) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The other scales illustrated no significant associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: No elevated risk of abnormal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> regulation was observed for deviating scores on personality scales </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Instead, reduced risks were indicated in men with low antagonism, and in men and women with high hedonic capacity </plain></SENT>
