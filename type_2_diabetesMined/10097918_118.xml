<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate glycemic control in a representative sample of U.S. adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey included national samples of non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, and Mexican Americans aged &gt; or = 20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Information on medical history and treatment of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was obtained to determine those who had been diagnosed with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by a physician before the survey (n = 1,480) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and HbA1c were measured, and the frequencies of sociodemographic and clinical variables related to glycemic control were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A higher proportion of non-Hispanic blacks were treated with insulin and a higher proportion of Mexican Americans were treated with oral agents compared with non-Hispanic whites, but the majority of adults in each racial or ethnic group (71-83%) used pharmacologic treatment for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Use of multiple daily insulin injections was more common in whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> self-monitoring was less common in Mexican Americans, but most patients had never self-monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HbA1c values in the nondiabetic range were found in 26% of non-Hispanic whites, 17% of non-Hispanic blacks, and 20% of Mexican Americans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Poor glycemic control (HbA1c &gt; 8%) was more common in non-Hispanic black women (50%) and Mexican-American men (45%) compared with the other groups (35-38%), but HbA1c for both sexes and for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> racial and ethnic groups was substantially higher than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Those with HbA1c &gt; 8% included 52% of insulin-treated patients and 42% of those taking oral agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no relationship of glycemic control to socioeconomic status or access to medical care in any racial or ethnic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that many patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the U.S. have poor glycemic control, placing them at high risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Non-Hispanic black women, Mexican-American men, and patients treated with insulin and oral agents were disproportionately represented among those in poor glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Clinical, public health, and research efforts should focus on more effective methods to control blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
