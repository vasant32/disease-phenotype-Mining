<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate day-to-day variations of insulin needs in type 2 diabetic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e>) on maintenance hemodialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We developed a 24-h euglycemic clamp in patients who received an average of 2,200 calories in a standardized three-meal and two-snack regimen per day, adjusted to body size and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intravenous insulin was adjusted every 30 min to achieve 5.5 +/- 1.1 mmol/l glycemia over 24 h prehemodialysis, during hemodialysis session, and 24 h posthemodialysis in 10 type 2 diabetic patients, aged 55.7 +/- 8.7 years with 11.9 +/- 4.5 years <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration, undergoing maintenance hemodialysis for 2.3 +/- 2.3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Insulin requirements were derived from the dose of insulin administered to maintain euglycemia per period of time and day-to-day comparisons performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean capillary glycemia was 5.5 +/- 0.3 mmol/l prehemodialysis and 5.3 +/- 0.2 mmol/l posthemodialysis (P = 0.39) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pre- and posthemodialysis areas under the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> curve were comparable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was achieved by infusing 23.6 +/- 7.7 IU/24 h prehemodialysis vs. 19.9 +/- 4.9 IU/24 h posthemodialysis, indicating a 15.3% decrease posthemodialysis (P = 0.09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Basal insulin needs decreased from 0.4 +/- 0.1/h prehemodialysis to 0.3 +/- 0.1/h posthemodialysis (P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Total boluses were decreased by 2.2 +/- 3.1 IU (P = 0.15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Changes in blood <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> did not correlate with changes in insulin needs (r = 0.1, P = 0.79) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study has demonstrated a significant 25% reduction in basal insulin requirements the day after dialysis compared with the day before </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No significant change in boluses was observed, and overall the reduction of total insulin requirements was -15% equivalent to -4 IU/day posthemodialysis of marginal statistical significance </plain></SENT>
