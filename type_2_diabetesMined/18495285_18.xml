<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients (226, treated with diet with/without OADs, mean HbA(1c) 8.30%, mean BMI 23.9kg/m(2)) were randomized after OAD discontinuation and washout to receive liraglutide 0.1, 0.3, 0.6 or 0.9mg once daily, or placebo in double-blind, parallel-group design for 14 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Liraglutide dose levels reduced HbA(1c) versus placebo (by 0.79%, 1.22%, 1.64% and 1.85%, respectively; p&lt;0.0001 for linear contrast) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Liraglutide 0.9mg/day resulted in 75% of patients achieving HbA(1c) &lt;7.0% and 57% achieving HbA(1c) &lt;6.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no major or minor hypoglycemic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Liraglutide also reduced, with significant dose-response (each p&lt;0.0001 for linear contrast) versus placebo: fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (up to 2.5mmol/L), postprandial (0-3h) <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excursion (up to 12.8mmol/(Lh)); and increased postprandial insulin secretion (up to 23.0microU/(mLh)) and beta-cell function as evaluated by HOMA-beta (up to around 20.0(microU/mL)/(mg/dL)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Body weight was unchanged; no development of liraglutide antibodies was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Liraglutide was highly effective and well tolerated at doses up to 0.9mg/day in Japanese patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, allowing glycemic control without <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
