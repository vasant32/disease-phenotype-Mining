<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between dietary fiber and the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in older men and the role of hepatic and inflammatory markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study was performed prospectively and included 3,428 nondiabetic men (age 60-79 years) followed up for 7 years, during which there were 162 incident cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Low total dietary fiber (lowest quartile &lt; or =20 g/day) was associated with increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after adjustment for total calorie intake and potential confounders (relative risk -1.47 [95% CI 1.03-2.11]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This increased risk was seen separately for both low cereal and low vegetable fiber intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dietary fiber was inversely associated with inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, interleukin-6) and with tissue plasminogen activator and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24190">gamma-glutamyl</z:chebi> transferase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adjustment for these markers attenuated the increased risk (1.28 [0.88-1.86]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Dietary fiber is associated with reduced <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk, which may be partly explained by inflammatory markers and hepatic fat deposition </plain></SENT>
