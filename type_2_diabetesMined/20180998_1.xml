<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a population-based descriptive cross-sectional study conducted on a sample of 131 individuals of both genders aged 20 years or more (66.8% of the target population) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CG was measured with a glucometer in a blood sample obtained from the fingertip and PG was determined by an enzymatic method (hexokinase) in venous blood plasma, after a 10-14 hour fast in both cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data were analyzed by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve in order to identify the best cut-off point for fasting glycemia (CG and PG) for the diagnosis of DM, using the 2-hour plasma glycemia &gt; 200 mg/dl as gold - standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The ROC curve revealed that the best cut-off point for the screening of DM was 110 mg/dl for CG and 105 mg/dl for PG, values that would optimize the relation between individuals with positive and false-positive results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The area under the ROC curve was 0.814 for CG (p &lt; 0.01) and 0.836 for PG (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The cut-off points of 105 mg/dl(5.8 mmol/l) for PG and of 110 mg/dl(6.1 mmol/l) for CG appear to be the most appropriate for the screening of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DM2</z:e> in the population under study, with emphasis on the fact that the value recommended for CG is 5 mg/dl higher than that for PG, in contrast to WHO recommendations </plain></SENT>
