<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifteen African-American and 18 Caucasian children and adolescents between 8 and 18 years of age were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intravenous bolus of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (250 mg/kg) was administered and blood samples collected at frequent intervals for three hours following the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A nonlinear mixed-effect population kinetic analysis with covariate structure was performed using Monolix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significantly higher initial insulin secretion from a readily releasable pool, which is responsible for the first-phase insulin secretion, was detected in African-Americans compared to Caucasians (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The proposed kinetic model is able to describe the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin response, account for the first-phase insulin release and identify a racially-based pharmacokinetic difference in insulin's biphasic secretion behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is hypothesized that the first-phase insulin component may play an important role in the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The proposed mechanistic model provides a quantitative analysis of the biphasic insulin release that may be useful in the early detection of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
