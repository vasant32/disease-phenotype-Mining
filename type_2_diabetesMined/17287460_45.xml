<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have developed a highly specific small molecule inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase, an enzyme that catalyzes a necessary step in the conversion of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi> to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24402">glycosphingolipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When administered to mice and rats, <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>-DNM significantly reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24402">glycosphingolipid</z:chebi> but not <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi> concentrations in various tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment of ob/ob mice with <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>-DNM normalized their elevated tissue glucosylceramide levels, markedly lowered circulating <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, improved oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, reduced A1C, and improved insulin sensitivity in muscle and liver </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings provide further evidence that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24402">glycosphingolipid</z:chebi> metabolites of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi> may be involved in mediating the link between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and that interference with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24402">glycosphingolipid</z:chebi> biosynthesis might present a novel approach to the therapy of states of impaired insulin action such as type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
