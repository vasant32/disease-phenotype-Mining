<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A prior genome-wide linkage scan in Pima Indians indicated a young-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (aged &lt;45 years) type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility locus on chromosome 1q21-q23 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ARHGEF11, which encodes the Rho <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16235">guanine</z:chebi> nucleotide exchange factor 11, was analyzed as a positional candidate gene for this linkage because this protein may stimulate Rho-dependent signals, such as the insulin signaling cascade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ARHGEF11 gene, and two adjacent genes NTRK1 and INSRR, were sequenced in 24 Pima Indians who were not first-degree relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sequencing of the coding regions, 5' and 3' untranslated regions and putative promoter regions of these genes, identified 28 variants in ARHGEF11, 11 variants in NTRK1, and 8 variants in INSSR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These 47 variants, as well as 84 additional public database variants within/between these genes, were genotyped for association analysis in the same group of Pima Indians who had participated in the linkage study (n = 1,228) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An R1467H in ARHGEF11, and several additional noncoding variants that were in high linkage disequilibrium with this variant, were nominally associated with young-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P = 0.01; odds ratio 3.39) after adjusting for sex, family membership, and Pima heritage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The risk allele H had a frequency of 0.10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a subgroup of 262 nondiabetic, full-heritage Pima Indians who had undergone detailed metabolic testing, the risk allele H also was associated with a lower mean insulin-mediated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal rate and a lower mean nonoxidative <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> storage rate after adjusting for age, sex, nuclear family membership, and percentage of body fat (P &lt; or = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that variation within ARHGEF11 nominally increases risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, possibly as a result of increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
