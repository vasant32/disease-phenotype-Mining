<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed immmunohistochemical analysis of IL-18 and IL-18 receptor (IL-18 R) in human kidney tissue derived from 12 subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, and compared with those in 7 subjects with minimal change <z:hpo ids='HP_0000100'>nephrotic syndrome</z:hpo> (MCNS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, we examined the regulation of IL-18 expression using human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (HRPTECs) in culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IL-18 expression in tubular cells was observed in higher rate (83%) in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, whereas one positive specimen (14.3%) for IL-18 in patients with MCNS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, IL-18 R was expressed in glomerular mesangial cells and endothelial cells as well as tubular cells, similarly in almost of both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Exposure to transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta(1)) led to two-fold increase in IL-18 gene expression in HRPTECs, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinases (MAPK) inhibitors abolished TGF-beta(1)-induced IL-18 mRNA expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis showed the IL-18 protein in HRPTECs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present data indicate that IL-18 is overexpressed in human tubular epithelial cells in diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, probably through the activation of MAPK pathways induced by TGF-beta(1) </plain></SENT>
