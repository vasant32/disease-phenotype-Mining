<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>Weight loss</z:hpo> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is associated with improved glycemic control and reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> risk factors, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> is notably difficult to achieve and sustain with caloric restriction and exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of treatment with orlistat, a pancreatic lipase inhibitor, on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, glycemic control, and serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a multicenter 57-week randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study, 120 mg orlistat or placebo was administered orally three times a day with a mildly hypocaloric diet to 391 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> men and women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were aged &gt; 18 years, had a BMI of 28-40 kg/m2, and were clinically stable on oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Changes in body weight, glycemic control, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels, and drug tolerability were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 1 year of treatment, the orlistat group lost 6.2 +/- 0.45% (mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) of initial body weight vs. 4.3 +/- 0.49% in the placebo group (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twice as many patients receiving orlistat (49 vs. 23%) lost &gt; or = 5% of initial body weight (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Orlistat treatment plus diet compared with placebo plus diet was associated with significant improvement in glycemic control, as reflected in decreases in HbA1c (P &lt; 0.001) and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.001) and in dosage reductions of oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> medication (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Orlistat therapy also resulted in significantly greater improvements than placebo in several <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> parameters, namely, greater reductions in total cholesterol, (P &lt; 0.001), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.001), <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.05), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B (P &lt; 0.001), and the <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-to-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> ratio (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mild to moderate and transient gastrointestinal events were reported with orlistat therapy, although their association with study withdrawal was low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="24020">Fat-soluble vitamin</z:chebi> levels generally remained within the reference range, and vitamin supplementation was required in only a few patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Orlistat is an effective treatment modality in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with respect to clinically meaningful <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and maintenance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, improved glycemic control, and improved <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile </plain></SENT>
