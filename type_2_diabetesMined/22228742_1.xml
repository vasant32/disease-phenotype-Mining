<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In 793 individuals of the Dutch Famine Birth Cohort, we analyzed the interaction between three SIRT1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and prenatal exposure to famine on type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the total population (exposed and unexposed), SIRT1 variants were not associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A significant interaction was found between two SIRT1 SNPs and exposure to famine in utero on type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk (P = 0.03 for rs7895833; P = 0.01 for rs1467568) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Minor alleles of these SNPs were associated with a lower prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> only in individuals who had been exposed to famine prenatally (odds ratio for rs7895833 0.50 [95% CI 0.24-1.03], P = 0.06; for rs1467568 0.48 [0.25-0.91], P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SIRT1 may be an important genetic factor involved in fetal programming during <z:hpo ids='HP_0004395'>malnutrition</z:hpo>, influencing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk later in life </plain></SENT>
