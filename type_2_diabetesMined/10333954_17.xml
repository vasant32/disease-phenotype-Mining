<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This study was case-controlled, with matched pairs for 71 newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects aged 40-70 years were recruited from a risk population for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> seen in the Risk Factors in IGT for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> (RIAD) Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Standard risk factors, 75-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test with real insulin, proinsulin, and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, and ultrasound measurement of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> of the common carotid artery were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The diabetic subjects, both men and women, displayed carotid intimal-medial thickening, even in the subgroup with fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> between 7.0 and 7.8 mmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HbA1c was significantly increased in the diabetic patients (6.33 vs. 5.48%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Insulin, proinsulin, and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> were also significantly higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the coronary risk factors, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> and plasminogen activator inhibitor were significantly increased </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> in the diabetic group was correlated to <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> and the total-to-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the total group, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> was significantly correlated to blood pressure, 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance testing, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp>, and the total-to-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> ratio, and inversely correlated to <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No independent determinant of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> was found in the diabetic group by multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
