<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine factors associated with variation in the risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in women with prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> mellitus (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review of articles published between January 1965 and August 2001, in which subjects underwent testing for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> and then testing for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We abstracted diagnostic criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, cumulative incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and factors that predicted incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 28 studies were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After the index pregnancy, the cumulative incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> ranged from 2.6% to over 70% in studies that examined women 6 weeks postpartum to 28 years postpartum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Differences in rates of progression between ethnic groups was reduced by adjustment for various lengths of follow-up and testing rates, so that women appeared to progress to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at similar rates after a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cumulative incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> increased markedly in the first 5 years after delivery and appeared to plateau after 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An elevated fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level during pregnancy was the risk factor most commonly associated with future risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Conversion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> varies with the length of follow-up and cohort retention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Adjustment for these differences reveals rapid increases in the cumulative incidence occurring in the first 5 years after delivery for different racial groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Targeting women with elevated fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels during pregnancy may prove to have the greatest effect for the effort required </plain></SENT>
