<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate whether mutations in this gene might contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, we screened the exons encoding the aminoterminal transcriptional activation domain in a cohort of 85 unrelated human subjects with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two missense mutations (P87L and P416A) were found in single affected patients but not in 47 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, these variants were indistinguishable from the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> in their ability to bind DNA or to transactivate an SREBP-1 responsive promoter construct </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also identified a common intronic single nucleotide polymorphism (C/T) located between exon 18c and 19c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a case-control study of 517 U.K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Caucasian case subjects and 517 age- and sex-matched control subjects, the T-allele at this locus was significantly associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in men (odds ratio = 1.42 [1.11-1.82], P = 0.005) but not women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a separate population-based study of 1,100 Caucasians, carriers of the T-allele showed significantly higher levels of total and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.05) compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In summary, we have conducted the first study of the SREBP-1c gene as a candidate for human <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although the rare mutations identified were functionally silent in the assays used, we obtained some evidence, which requires conformation in other populations, that a common variant in the SREBP-1c gene might influence <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk and plasma cholesterol level </plain></SENT>
