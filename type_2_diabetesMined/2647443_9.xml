<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were similar for the two groups but the Nisei had higher levels of insulin at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time points (P less than 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Nisei men had a higher mean body mass index (P less than 0.001) and the Tokyo men had had <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for a longer duration (P less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data were also compared following selection of a subgroup of Nisei men (n = 39) with a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration of 2-25 years, making this group more similar to the Tokyo men with respect to this variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Nisei still had significantly higher plasma insulin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because of a significant (P less than 0.01) positive correlation between plasma insulin and body mass index in Nisei, but not in Tokyo men, data comparing the Nisei subgroup and Tokyo men were re-examined by analysis of covariance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With an adjustment for body mass index in the analysis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> differences in plasma insulin, except for the fasting insulin level, were no longer significant between the Nisei and Tokyo men, suggesting that body mass index was responsible for these differences </plain></SENT>
