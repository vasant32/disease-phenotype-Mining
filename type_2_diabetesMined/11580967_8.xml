<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The cost-effectiveness analysis of mass screening for Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM) was performed to elucidate whether, who and how often it should be conducted in Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A series of Markov process was developed to model the disease natural history of Type 2 DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A hypothetical cohort with 30,000 residents aged over 30 years in Taiwan was randomly assigned to three arms of screening regimes, biennial, five-yearly and the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A Monte Carlo computer simulation was performed to calculate effectiveness of two screening regimes compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Direct costs and utilities were incorporated to each corresponding state to calculate the incremental costs per life-years gained and per quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for biennial and five-yearly screening regimes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incremental costs for biennial screening regime were estimated at $26,750 per life-year gained, and $17,833 per QALY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The corresponding figures for five-yearly screening regime were $10,531 per life-year gained and $17,113 per QALY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incremental costs per life-year gained and per QALY increase with age, ranging from $17,238 for aged 30-39 years to $54,700 for aged over 70 years and from $9193 to 36,467, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, mass screening for Type 2 DM, especially in younger subjects, with 5-year inter-screening interval is cost-effective in Taiwan </plain></SENT>
