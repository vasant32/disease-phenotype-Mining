<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently, an A-to-G variant in intron 3 (SNP43) of the calcium-activated neutral protease 10 gene (CAPN10) was identified as a possible type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility gene through positional cloning in Mexican-Americans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted cross-sectional and prospective studies to evaluate the relation between SNP43 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and related traits in middle-aged African-American participants of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Risk in Communities Study, a population-based longitudinal study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At baseline, 269 prevalent <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> cases and 1,159 nondiabetic control subjects were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Those with the G/G genotype were more likely to have <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than those with the A/G or A/A genotype (odds ratio [OR] 1.41, 95% CI 1.00-1.99, P = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the prospective study, 166 of the control subjects developed incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> over 9 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for individuals with the G/G genotype did not differ significantly from those with at least one copy of the A allele (23.3 vs. 19.5 per 1,000 person years, P = 0.29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pooling prevalent and incident diabetic cases together, individuals with the G/G genotype were approximately 40% more likely to have <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than those without (OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.04-1.83, P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because of the high frequency of the G allele (0.88), approximately 25% of the susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in African-Americans may be attributed to the G/G genotype at SNP43 of CAPN10, although most of the subjects with the G/G genotype did not develop <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> over the 9 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude from this large prospective study that the G allele of SNP43 of CAPN10 or another allele or gene that is in linkage disequilibrium with it increases susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in African-Americans </plain></SENT>
