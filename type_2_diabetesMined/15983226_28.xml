<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy is associated with reduced macrovascular complications in overweight patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is uncertain whether such improvement in the cardiovascular outcome is related to specific vasculoprotective effects of this drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we determined the effect of leptin on human aortic smooth muscle cell (HASMC) proliferation and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 expression, the signaling pathways mediating these effects, and the modulatory effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> on these parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Incubation of HASMCs with leptin enhanced the proliferation and MMP-2 expression in these cells and increased the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These effects were abolished by vitamin E </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13392">NAD(P)H</z:chebi> oxidase and protein kinase C (PKC) suppressed the effect of leptin on ROS production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In HASMCs, leptin induced PKC, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation and inhibition of these signaling pathways abrogated HASMC proliferation and MMP-2 expression induced by this hormone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment of HASMCs with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> decreased leptin-induced ROS production and activation of PKC, ERK1/2, and NF-kappaB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> also inhibited the effect of leptin on HASMC proliferation and MMP-2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall, these results demonstrate that leptin induced HASMC proliferation and MMP-2 expression through a PKC-dependent activation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13392">NAD(P)H</z:chebi> oxidase with subsequent activation of the ERK1/2/NF-kappaB pathways and that therapeutic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> concentrations effectively inhibit these biological effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest a new mechanism by which <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> may improve cardiovascular outcome in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
