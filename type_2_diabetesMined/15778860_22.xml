<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adiponectin, a novel adipocyte-derived protein with insulin-sensitising properties, has been proposed as a factor linking <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta cell dysfunction</z:hpo> in the pathogenesis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted the current investigation to determine whether adiponectin is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta cell dysfunction</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 180 women undergoing OGTT in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878751" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">late pregnancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on the OGTT results, participants were stratified into three groups: (1) NGT (n=93); (2) IGT (n=39); and (3) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> (n=48) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>First-phase insulin secretion was determined using a validated index previously proposed by Stumvoll </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity was assessed using the validated OGTT insulin sensitivity index of Matsuda and DeFronzo (IS(OGTT)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: To evaluate beta cell function in relation to ambient insulin sensitivity, an insulin secretion-sensitivity index (ISSI) was derived from the product of the Stumvoll index and the IS(OGTT), based on the existence of the predicted hyperbolic relationship between these two measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean ISSI was highest in the NGT group (6,731), followed by that in the IGT group (4,976) and then that in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> group (3,300) (overall p&lt;0.0001), compatible with the notion of declining beta cell function across these <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Importantly, adiponectin was significantly correlated with ISSI (r=0.34, p&lt;0.0001), with a stepwise increase in mean ISSI observed per tertile of adiponectin concentration (trend p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In multivariate linear regression analysis, ISSI was positively correlated with adiponectin and negatively correlated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e>, IGT and C-reactive protein (r(2)=0.54) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Adiponectin concentration is an independent correlate of beta cell function in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878751" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">late pregnancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>As such, adiponectin may play a key role in mediating <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta cell dysfunction</z:hpo> in the pathogenesis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
