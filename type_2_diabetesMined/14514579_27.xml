<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the 10-year probability of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> (CHD) in diabetic adults and how well basic and novel risk factors predict CHD risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We measured risk factors in 14054 participants (1500 with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) initially free of CHD in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Risk in Communities study from 1987 to 1989 and followed them prospectively for CHD incidence through 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used proportional hazards regression models and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for CHD risk prediction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Based on our model using basic risk factors (age, race, total and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, systolic blood pressure, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensives</z:chebi>, and smoking status), approximately 61% of diabetic women and 86% of diabetic men had a predicted 10-year CHD probability &gt;or=10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This CHD risk-prediction model had an area under the ROC curve of 0.72 in diabetic women and 0.67 in diabetic men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Novel risk factors or subclinical disease markers individually added only modest predictivity, but the addition of multiple markers (BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, Keys dietary score, serum albumin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, factor VIII, white blood cell count, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> determined by electrocardiogram, and carotid intima-media thickness) increased the area under the curve by approximately 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> diabetic adults are at high risk for CHD, their variation in CHD risk can be predicted moderately well by basic risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No single novel risk marker greatly enhanced absolute CHD risk assessment, but a battery of novel markers did </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our model can provide estimates of CHD risk for the primary prevention of this disease in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
