<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To analyze prospectively the importance of urinary N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG), a marker for renal tubular function, in comparison with urinary albumin excretion (UAE), a marker for glomerular renal function, with respect to macrovascular disease in elderly patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We followed 124 patients over a mean period of 7.0 +/- 0.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At baseline, urinary NAG, UAE, age, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration, sex, blood pressure, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, and serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Also, history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo> (PVD), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> and concomitant medication, and smoking habits were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 7 years, patients were reevaluated, and a multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to test risk factors for significance in order to predict macrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subgroups of patients were analyzed with respect to severe macrovascular disease, with a separate analysis for surviving patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with known <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> such as <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> and total cholesterol, urinary NAG was similarly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> for the total cohort (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analyzing the subgroup of 65 patients still alive after follow-up care, urinary NAG and UAE were significantly elevated at baseline and at the time of follow-up care in patients with MI and PVD, but not in those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a positive predictive trend of NAG excretion for the development of MI and PVD in our patients (P = 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Urinary NAG proved comparable to UAE when analyzed with respect to preexistence and development of severe macrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It needs to be determined by further studies if urinary NAG will be of value to serve as an adjunct marker to UAE in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
