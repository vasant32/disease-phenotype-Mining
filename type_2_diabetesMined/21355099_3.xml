<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Accumulating evidence has identified a positive association between active smoking and the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but previous studies had limited information on passive smoking or changes in smoking behaviors over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This analysis examined the association between exposure to passive smoke, active smoking, and the risk of incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study of 100,526 women in the Nurses' Health Study who did not have prevalent <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in 1982, with follow-up for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for 24 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 5,392 incident cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during 24 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with nonsmokers with no exposure to passive smoke, there was an increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among nonsmokers who were occasionally (relative risk [RR] 1.10 [95% CI 0.94-1.23]) or regularly (1.16 [1.00-1.35]) exposed to passive smoke </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The risk of incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was increased by 28% (12-50) among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> past smokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The risk diminished as time since quitting increased but still was elevated even 20-29 years later (1.15 [1.00-1.32]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Current smokers had the highest risk of incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adjusted RRs increased from 1.39 (1.17-1.64) for 1-14 cigarettes per day to 1.98 (1.57-2.36) for â‰¥25 cigarettes per day compared with nonsmokers with no exposure to passive smoke </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that exposure to passive smoke and active smoking are positively and independently associated with the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
