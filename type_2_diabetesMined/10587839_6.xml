<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: It has previously been demonstrated that the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> is low among otherwise healthy elderly fasted patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> taking oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, these agents do cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> in clinical practice, suggesting that accompanying factors must typically be present for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> to occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">Ethanol</z:chebi> is one putative risk factor that has not been evaluated as a mechanism for low blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> among <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> users </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that low concentrations of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> would reduce blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations in elderly type 2 diabetic patients receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> during a short-term fast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 10 type 2 diabetic patients, aged 68 +/- 3 years and receiving 20 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi> daily, participated in a prospective double-blind placebo-controlled in-patient study consisting of two 24-h fasts at least 1 week apart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During hours 14 and 15 of the fasting studies, subjects received intravenous infusions of either 4.35 mmol.kg-1.h-1 ethanol (equivalent to one or two alcoholic beverages) or saline placebo in random order </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">Ethanol</z:chebi>, plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, and counterregulatory hormones were assessed very 30-60 min during the final 10 h of the fast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Blood <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> levels peaked at 17 +/- 2 mmol/l (the lower legal limit of intoxication in New Mexico) during the <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations did not differ at baseline (placebo 8.5 +/- 1.8 vs. <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> 8.7 +/- 1.7 mmol/l; P = 0.50), but nadir plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was lower after the <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> infusion compared with placebo (4.4 +/- 1.2 vs. 5.0 +/- 1.4 mmol/l; P = 0.01), and the absolute decline in plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was also greater during the <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> study than the placebo study (4.7 +/- 0.9 vs. 3.6 +/- 1.2 mmol/l; P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Counterregulatory hormone levels were increased during the <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> study and nonesterified fatty acid concentrations were suppressed compared with the placebo study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Low doses of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> predispose fasted elderly type 2 diabetic patients to low blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> during a short-term fast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This may be one of several mechanisms by which <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> occurs in elderly patients </plain></SENT>
