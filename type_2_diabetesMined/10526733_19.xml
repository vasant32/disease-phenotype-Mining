<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 144 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> aged 25-65 years in two internal medicine outpatient clinics were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>African-Americans and Hispanics made up &gt; 75% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Doctors and staff in one of the clinics were trained in the use of a clinical practice guideline based on Staged <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A problem-based learning educational program was instituted to reach consensus on a stepped intensification scheme for glycemic control and to determine the standards of care used in the clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HbA1c was obtained at baseline and at 9 and 15 months after enrollment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At 9 months, there was a mean -0.90% within-subject change in HbA1c in the intervention group, with no significant changes in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 15-month mean within-subject change in HbA1c of -0.62% in the intervention group was also significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among intervention patients, those with the poorest glycemic control at baseline realized the greatest benefit in improvement of HbA1c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The intervention group also exhibited significant changes in physician adherence with American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association standards of care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Clinical practice guidelines are an effective way of improving the processes and outcomes of care for patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Problem-based learning is a useful strategy to gain physician support for clinical practice guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>More intensive interventions are needed to maintain treatment gains </plain></SENT>
