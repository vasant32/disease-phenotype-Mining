<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to elucidate which variant in TCF7L2 confers <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility in African Americans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Through the evaluation of tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility was limited to a 4.3-kb interval, which contains the YRI (African) linkage disequilibrium (LD) block containing rs7903146 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To better define the relationship between type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk and genetic variation we resequenced this 4.3-kb region in 96 African American DNAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three novel and 13 known SNPs were identified: 20 with minor allele frequencies (MAF) &gt;0.05 and 12 with MAF &gt;0.10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These polymorphisms and the previously identified DG10S478 microsatellite were evaluated in African American type 2 diabetic cases (n = 1,033) and controls (n = 1,106) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Variants identified from direct sequencing and databases were genotyped or imputed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifteen SNPs showed association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P &lt; 0.05) with rs7903146 being the most significant (P = 6.32 × 10(-6)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results of imputation, haplotype, and conditional analysis of SNPs were consistent with rs7903146 being the trait-defining SNP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the DG10S478 microsatellite, which is outside the 4.3-kb LD block, revealed consistent association of risk allele 8 with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (odds ratio [OR] = 1.33; P = 0.022) as reported in European populations; however, allele 16 (MAF = 0.016 cases and 0.032 controls) was strongly associated with reduced risk (OR = 0.39; P = 5.02 × 10(-5)) in contrast with previous studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In African Americans, these observations suggest that rs7903146 is the trait-defining polymorphism associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these results support ethnic differences in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> associations </plain></SENT>
