<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study evaluates the relationship of CRP and IL6 with CHD risk factors in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM) with CHD and age and sex matched type 2 DM controls without CHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CRP, IL-6, total plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> (tHcy), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> (a) [Lp(a)] and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi> (SA) were determined in 55 type 2 diabetic patients with CHD and 51 age- and sex-matched type 2 diabetic controls without CHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariate and logistic regression analyses were used to relate these markers with CHD risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CRP (P=0.02) and tHcy (P=0.03) were significantly higher in patients with CHD compared with the control group even after correction for age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IL6, Lp(a), SA and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> parameters were not significantly different between the two groups of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for potential confounders, the odds ratio (OR) for elevated CRP was 2.00 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-3.58) (P=0.02) but the OR for IL6 was 3.41 95% CI, 0.70-17.17 (P=0.14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Partial correlation analyses of CRP and IL6 with other variables showed significant correlation of CRP with tHcy, and SA in patients with CHD only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results support the inclusion of CRP (high-sensitivity assay), in the risk assessment of diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
