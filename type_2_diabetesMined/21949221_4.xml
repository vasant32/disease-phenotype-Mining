<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Consecutive type 2 diabetic patients (n = 505) followed up at our <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> clinic were evaluated at baseline (1995) for the main <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> and for five glycemic control parameters (fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> 2 h after breakfast, blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> 2 h after lunch, blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> before dinner, and A1C); <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality and the first cardiovascular events occurring during the 14-year follow-up were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We observed 172 cardiovascular events (34.1% of the population) and 147 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (29.1% of the population) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using the Cox analysis with the backward method, we categorized the variables according to the therapeutic targets of the American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our observations were as follows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When the five glycemic control parameters were considered together, the predictors were 1) for cardiovascular events, blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> 2 h after lunch (hazard ratio 1.507, P = 0.010) and A1C (1.792, P = 0.002); and 2) for mortality, blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> 2 h after lunch (1.885, P &lt; 0.0001) and A1C (1.907, P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> 2 h after lunch and A1C were considered together with the main <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, the following glycemic control parameters were predictors: 1) for cardiovascular events, blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> 2 h after lunch (1.452, P = 0.021) and A1C (1.732, P = 0.004); and 2) for mortality, blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> 2 h after lunch (1.846, P = 0.001) and A1C (1.896, P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, both postprandial blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and A1C predict cardiovascular events and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality in a long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
