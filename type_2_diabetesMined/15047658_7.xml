<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined this relationship and the potential mediating role of blood pressure in older patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: At least two of three components of cardiovascular autonomic testing were completed by 132 patients (mean age 70 +/- 5.6 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Relative rankings on each of the components were averaged to create a summary heart rate variability (HRV) measure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The urine microalbumin-to-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio (milligrams albumin/grams <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>) was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure was measured at rest and by 24-h ambulatory recording </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Urine microalbumin-to-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio was higher in those with lower HRV (mean urine microalbumin-to-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio 28, 56, and 191 mg/g from the highest to lowest tertile of HRV; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Resting and ambulatory blood pressure levels were negatively correlated with HRV and positively correlated with urine microalbumin-to-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis adjusting for age, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, HbA(1c), and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, HRV and blood pressure were both independently associated with urine microalbumin-to-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio, with no evidence that either mediates the effect of the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cardiovascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0259749" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autonomic neuropathy</z:e> and blood pressure are independently associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> in older patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
