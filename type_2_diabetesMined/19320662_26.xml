<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment-naive patients with T2DM who had a glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA(1c)) of 7.5-11% (N = 1179) were randomized equally to receive vildagliptin plus high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> combination therapy (50 mg + 1000 mg twice daily), vildagliptin plus low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> combination therapy (50 mg + 500 mg twice daily), vildagliptin monotherapy (50 mg twice daily) or high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy (1000 mg twice daily) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary objective was to demonstrate that HbA(1c) reduction from baseline with either combination therapy is superior to both monotherapies at the week 24 endpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients who failed glycaemic-screening criteria [HbA(1c )&gt;11% or fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) &gt;15 mmol/l (270 mg/dl)] could enter a 24-week, single-arm substudy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These patients (N = 94) received open-label vildagliptin plus high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> combination therapy (100 mg + 1000 mg twice daily) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From comparable baseline values (8.6-8.7%), HbA(1c) decreased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four treatment groups, to the greatest extent with vildagliptin plus high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> combination therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean (SE) HbA(1c) change from baseline was -1.8% (0.06%), -1.6% (0.06%), -1.1% (0.06%) and -1.4% (0.06%) with vildagliptin plus high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> combination therapy, vildagliptin plus low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> combination therapy, and vildagliptin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapies respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The between-group difference was superior with vildagliptin plus high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> combination therapy (p &lt; 0.001 vs. both monotherapies) and vildagliptin plus low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> combination therapy (p &lt; 0.001 and p = 0.004, vs. vildagliptin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapies, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Higher baseline HbA(1c) values were linked to greater HbA(1c) reductions, with changes of -3.2% (0.22%), -2.7% (0.22%), -1.5% (0.24%) and -2.6% (0.26%) respectively, occurring in patients with baseline HbA(1c)&gt;or=10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Reductions in FPG were superior with vildagliptin plus high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> combination therapy [change from baseline -2.63 (0.13) mmol/l] compared with both monotherapies [-1.26 (0.13) mmol/l and -1.92 (0.13) mmol/l, respectively; p &lt; 0.001] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> or severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> with either combination therapy, and neither was associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> treatments were well tolerated and displayed a comparable incidence of adverse events overall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Despite superior HbA(1c) lowering, the vildagliptin plus low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> combination therapy group demonstrated a favourable gastrointestinal (GI) tolerability profile compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In treatment-naive patients, combinations of vildagliptin and both high-dose and low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> provide superior efficacy to monotherapy treatments with a comparable overall tolerability profile and low risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The potential dose-sparing effect of adding vildagliptin to low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> in preference to the up-titration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> may allow patients to achieve equivalent or superior HbA(1c) lowering without the GI tolerability issues associated with higher doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
