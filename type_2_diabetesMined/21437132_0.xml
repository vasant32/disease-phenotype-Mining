<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>Weight gain</z:mp> can contribute towards the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2D), and some treatments for T2D can lead to <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine whether having T2D and also being <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> had a greater or lesser impact on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) than having either of the two conditions alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The 2003 dataset of the Health Survey for England (HSE) was analyzed using multiple regression analyses to examine the influence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and T2D on HRQoL, and to determine whether there was any interaction between these two disutilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: T2D reduced HRQoL by 0.029 points, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> reduced HRQoL by 0.027 points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no significant interaction effect between T2D and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, suggesting that the effect of having both T2D and being <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> is simply additive and results in a reduction in HRQoL of 0.056 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Based on analysis of HSE 2003 data, people with either T2D or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> experience significant reduction in HRQoL and people with both conditions have a reduction in HRQoL equal to the sum of the two independent effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> on HRQoL in people with T2D should be considered when selecting a therapy </plain></SENT>
