<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The healthy beta-cell has an enormous capacity to adapt to conditions of higher insulin demand (e.g. in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, pregnancy, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> excess) to maintain normoglycaemia with an increase in its functional beta-cell mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This compensates in 80-90% of individuals for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, in 10-20% of individuals, the beta-cells are unable to match the demands of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and insulin levels are relatively insufficient to maintain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This eventually leads to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, preservation of functional beta-cell mass has become central in the treatment of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> as well as T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this review is to summarize the recently described mechanisms of beta-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in T2DM and to postulate possible new targets for treatment </plain></SENT>
