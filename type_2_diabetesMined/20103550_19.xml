<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Exploratory post hoc intention-to-treat comparisons were made between intensive and standard glycemia groups on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality by subgroups defined by baseline characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were few significant interactions between baseline characteristics and effects of intensive versus standard glycemia treatment on mortality: self-reported history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> (hazard ratio [HR] 1.95, 95% CI 1.41-2.69) versus no history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> (0.99, 0.79-1.26; P value for interaction 0.0008), higher A1C (A1C &gt;8.5%: HR 1.64, 95% CI 1.22-2.22; A1C 7.5-8.4%: 1.00, 0.75-1.34; A1C &lt;7.5%: 1.00, 0.67-1.50; P value for interaction 0.04), and aspirin use (HR 1.45, 95% CI 1.13-1.85, compared with 0.96, 0.72-1.27, in nonusers; P value for interaction 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found a remarkable similarity of effect from intensive compared with standard glycemia treatment on mortality across most baseline subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No differential effect was found in subgroups defined by variables anticipated to have an interaction: age, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and previous history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The three baseline characteristics that defined subgroups for which there was a differential effect on mortality may help identify patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at higher risk of mortality from intensive regimens for glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further research is warranted </plain></SENT>
