<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined whether a high white blood cell count (WBC), a marker of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, predicts a worsening of insulin action, insulin secretory function, and the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Pima Indians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We measured WBC in 352 nondiabetic Pima Indians (215 men and 137 women, aged 27 +/- 6 years [means +/- SD], body fat 32 +/- 8%, WBC 8,107 +/- 2,022 cells/mm(3)) who were characterized for body composition (by hydrodensitometry or dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (by 75-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test), insulin action (M; by hyperinsulinemic clamp), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin secretory response (AIR; by 25-g intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> challenge) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among 272 subjects who were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerant (NGT) at baseline, 54 developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> over an average follow-up of 5.5 +/- 4.4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among those who remained nondiabetic, 81 subjects had follow-up measurements of M and AIR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cross-sectionally, WBC was related to percent body fat (r = 0.32, P &lt; 0.0001) and M (r = -0.24, P &lt; 0.0001), but not to AIR (r = 0.06, P = 0.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate analysis, when adjusted for age and sex, both percent body fat (P &lt; 0.0001) and M (P = 0.03) were independently associated with WBC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A high WBC value predicted <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (relative hazard 90th vs. 10th percentiles [95%CI] of 2.7 [1.3-5.4], P = 0.007) when adjusted for age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The predictive effect of WBC persisted after additional adjustment for established predictors of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, i.e., percent body fat, M, and AIR (relative hazard 2.6 [1.1-6.2], P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for follow-up duration, a high WBC at baseline was associated with a subsequent worsening of M (P = 0.003), but not a worsening of AIR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A high WBC predicts a worsening of insulin action and the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Pima Indians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> activation of the immune system may play a role in the pathogenesis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
