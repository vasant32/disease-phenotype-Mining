<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> suppress <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> in diabetic (NON x NZO)F1 males, these mice exhibit unusual sensitivity to drug-induced exacerbation of an underlying hepatosteatosis only rarely experienced in human patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To establish the pharmacogenetic basis for this sensitivity, a panel of recombinant congenic strains (RCSs) with varying degrees of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was generated by fixing selected NZO HlLt alleles on the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>- and hepatosteatosis-resistant NON/Lt background </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four new strains in this panel were exposed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only one, NONcNZO8 (designated RCS8), exhibited an F1-like hepatosteatotic response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In both the F1 and RCS8 males, this adverse effect correlated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> suppression of already impaired hepatic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49183">phosphatidylcholine</z:chebi> biosynthetic enzymes in both arms of the biosynthetic pathway, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16038">phosphatidylethanolamine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>- transferase pathway, and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16436,49086">CDP-choline</z:chebi> pathway, including <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> kinase and <z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18132">cholinephosphate</z:chebi> cytidylyltransferase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This adverse response was not reproduced by CL316,243, a beta3-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37886">adrenergic receptor agonist</z:chebi> with potent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35679">antihyperlipemic</z:chebi> effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Genome comparison showed that RCS8 differed from the other strains in carrying NZO-derived genome on virtually <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of chromosome 16 and in smaller segments on chromosomes 6, 14, and 17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, these RCSs present a panel of new mouse models exhibiting differential levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> as well as different drug responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This panel can be used to screen for treatments for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and its complications </plain></SENT>
