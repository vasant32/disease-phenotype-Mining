<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We conducted a community-based case-control study of African-American men and women in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Risk in Communities Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The allele frequencies of the Gly972Arg variant of the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) gene and the Ala54Thr variant of the fatty acid binding protein 2 (FABP2) gene were compared in 992 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects and three patient groups: 1) 321 type 2 diabetic individuals, 2) 260 severely <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals, and 3) 258 markedly hyperinsulinemic individuals without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Allele frequencies of Gly972Arg IRS-1 and Ala54Thr FABP2 were 0.07 and 0.22, respectively; there were no differences in allele or genotype frequencies between patients and control subjects for either gene variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In weighted linear regression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and control subjects, the presence of the IRS-1 gene variant was associated with a 0.85 (0.42) kg/m2 higher BMI (P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, individuals with at least one IRS-1 Arg972 allele and two FABP2 Thr54 alleles had a BMI of 33.3 (7.9) kg/m2, compared with 30.0 (6.3) kg/m2 for those with neither allele (P = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that in African-Americans, these variants in the IRS-1 and FABP2 genes are not associated with the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, or marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo>, but that their independent and joint effects may be associated with small increases in BMI </plain></SENT>
