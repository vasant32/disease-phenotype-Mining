<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The efficacy and safety of the 11betaHSD1 inhibitor INCB13739 were assessed when added to ongoing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> exhibiting inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7-11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This double-blind placebo-controlled paralleled study randomized 302 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (mean A1C 8.3%) on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy (mean 1.5 g/day) to receive one of five INCB13739 doses or placebo once daily for 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was the change in A1C at study end </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 12 weeks, 200 mg of INCB13739 resulted in significant reductions in A1C (-0.6%), fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (-24 mg/dl), and homeostasis model assessment-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-IR) (-24%) compared with placebo </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A reversible dose-dependent elevation in adrenocorticotrophic hormone, generally within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> reference range, was observed </plain></SENT>
