<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47612">bezafibrate</z:chebi>, an approved fibrate, can prevent or delay type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study using data from routine medical practice in the U.K., as captured by the General Practice Research Database (GPRD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Individuals chronically exposed to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47612">bezafibrate</z:chebi> were compared with individuals chronically exposed to other fibrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hazard ratios (HRs) for incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were calculated using a Cox proportional hazards model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A post hoc analysis was used to examine the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47612">bezafibrate</z:chebi> on progression to use of oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> medications or insulin in individuals with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47612">Bezafibrate</z:chebi> users had a lower hazard for incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than users of other fibrates (HR 0.66 [95% CI 0.53-0.81]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This effect became stronger with increasing duration of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Post hoc analysis of the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47612">bezafibrate</z:chebi> on progression of preexisting <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> also showed a lower hazard for progression to use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> medication (0.54 [0.38-0.76]) or progression to use of insulin (0.78 [0.55-1.10]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47612">Bezafibrate</z:chebi> appears to have clinically important <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Randomized controlled trials should be considered to assess the utility of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47612">bezafibrate</z:chebi> in treating patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or in preventing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in high-risk patients </plain></SENT>
