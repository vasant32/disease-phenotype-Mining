<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Physical activity is associated with a reduced risk of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and with reduced mortality among diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the effects of physical activity on the number of years lived with and without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim is to calculate the differences in life expectancy with and without type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> associated with different levels of physical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using data from the Framingham Heart Study, we constructed multistate life tables starting at age 50 years for men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transition rates by level of physical activity were derived for three transitions: nondiabetic to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, nondiabetic to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used hazard ratios associated with different physical activity levels after adjustment for age, sex, and potential confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For men and women with moderate physical activity, life expectancy without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at age 50 years was 2.3 (95% CI 1.2-3.4) years longer than for subjects in the low physical activity group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For men and women with high physical activity, these differences were 4.2 (2.9-5.5) and 4.0 (2.8-5.1) years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Life expectancy with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 0.5 (-1.0 to 0.0) and 0.6 (-1.1 to -0.1) years less for moderately active men and women compared with their sedentary counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For high activity, these differences were 0.1 (-0.7 to 0.5) and 0.2 (-0.8 to 0.3) years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Moderately and highly active people have a longer total life expectancy and live more years free of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than their sedentary counterparts but do not spend more years with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
