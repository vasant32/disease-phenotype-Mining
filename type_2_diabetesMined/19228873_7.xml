<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that, compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects, patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have a lower total adipocyte number with fewer small adipocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue was obtained from lean and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects with or without type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> matched for BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adipocyte size was measured by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="30687">osmium</z:chebi> fixation and sizing/counting in a Coulter counter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adipocyte size and number subdistributions (small, medium, large, and very large) were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects, type 2 diabetic patients had larger mean adipocyte size and 67% bigger very large adipocytes; the total adipocyte number was lower, but the fraction of small adipocytes was increased by 27% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Total adipocyte cellularity is lower in type 2 diabetic subjects than in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found no evidence for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of small adipocytes in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This suggests the presence of a defect in early maturation of adipocytes in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
