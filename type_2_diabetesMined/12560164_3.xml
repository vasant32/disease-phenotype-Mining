<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The objective of our study was to estimate the hospital inpatient prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> in a Spanish tertiary care teaching hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed a cohort of 1036 patients consecutively admitted over a 7-day period to our hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We classified this total of hospitalized patients based on information obtained from individual analysis of medical history and values of plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> after fasting, into groups with the following conditions: recognized <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, unrecognized <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, other hyperglycaemic situations, impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (IFG) or non <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hundred and seventy-eight patients were estimated to have <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (total prevalence: 17.2%), including 158 patients with recognized <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 20 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> unrecognized before admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, 25 patients were considered to have other hyperglycaemic situations and 20 patients were estimated to have IFG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean age of the diabetic patients was 65+/-13.7 years (50.5% men), and 94.4% had type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> disproportionately affects the elderly inpatient, with a prevalence of 30.9% in people older than 64 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the total number of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, only 144 (<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevalence: 13.8%) were registered in hospital discharge records as having <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the extent of hospital <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevalence considerably exceeds levels reported in the literature, suggesting that true <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevalence in hospitals could be significantly under-reported, resulting in a serious underestimate of required expenditures </plain></SENT>
