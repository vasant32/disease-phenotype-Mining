<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: It has been reported that moderate alcohol consumption decreased the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> but that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002910'>elevated liver enzymes</z:hpo> increased it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The comparative importance of alcohol consumption and liver enzymes as predictors of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> remains unconfirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The participants included 8,576 Japanese men, aged 40-55 years, without type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at entry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was diagnosed if a fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level was &gt;or=126 mg/dl or if participants were taking oral hypoglycemic medications or insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the 4-year follow-up period, we confirmed 878 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In multivariate models, moderate daily alcohol consumption (16.4-42.6 g <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi>/day) decreased the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and higher levels of gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased the risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In joint analyses of alcohol consumption and liver enzymes, moderate drinkers with the lowest tertile of GGT had the lowest risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with them, nondrinkers with the highest GGT had the highest risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (odds ratio 3.18 [95% CI 1.75-5.76]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At every level of GGT, moderate or heavy alcohol drinkers (&gt;or=42.7 g <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi>/day) had a lower risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than nondrinkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The relationship of ALT and daily alcohol consumption with the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was almost the same as that of GGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: GGT, ALT, and daily alcohol consumption were independently associated with the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nondrinkers with the highest GGT or ALT had a high risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
