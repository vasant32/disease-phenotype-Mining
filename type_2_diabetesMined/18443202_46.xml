<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Several whole-genome association studies have reported identification of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility genes in various European-derived study populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little investigation of these loci has been reported in other ethnic groups, specifically African Americans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Striking differences exist between these populations, suggesting they may not share identical genetic risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to examine the influence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> genes identified in whole-genome association studies in a large African American case-control population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 12 loci (e.g., TCF7L2, IDE/KIF11/HHEX, SLC30A8, CDKAL1, PKN2, IGF2BP2, FLJ39370, and EXT2/ALX4) associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in European-derived populations were genotyped in 993 African American type 2 diabetic and 1,054 African American control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, 68 ancestry-informative markers were genotyped to account for the impact of admixture on association results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Little evidence of association was observed between SNPs, with the exception of those in TCF7L2, and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in African Americans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One TCF7L2 SNP (rs7903146) showed compelling evidence of association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (admixture-adjusted additive P [P(a)] = 1.59 x 10(-6)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only the intragenic SNP on 11p12 (rs9300039, dominant P [P(d)] = 0.029) was also associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after admixture adjustments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, four of the SNPs are monomorphic in the Yoruba population of the HAPMAP project, with only the risk allele from the populations of European descent present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that these variants do not significantly contribute to interindividual susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in African Americans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Consequently, genes contributing to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in African Americans may, in part, be different from those in European-derived study populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>High frequency of risk alleles in several of these genes may, however, contribute to the increased prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in African Americans </plain></SENT>
