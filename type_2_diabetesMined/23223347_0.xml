<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Participants were recruited consecutively from a population-based cohort: NGT (n = 39), IGT (n = 29), and T2D (n = 51) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Electrophysiological measures included nerve conduction studies and thermal thresholds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) in skin biopsies was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS There was no difference between IGT and NGT in sural nerve conduction, IENFD, and thermal thresholds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IENFD was significantly lower in T2D (median = 2.8 fibers/mm [interquartile range 1.1-4.7 fibers/mm]) than NGT individuals (4.5 fibers/mm [3.4-6.1 fibers/mm]; P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>T2D participants had poorer nerve conduction and higher heat thresholds than NGT and IGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS Large and small nerve function in people with IGT did not differ from those with NGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our finding does not support the existence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetic</z:e> stage </plain></SENT>
