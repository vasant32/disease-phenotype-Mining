<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1) is a transcription factor that acts on nuclear genes encoding respiratory subunits and components of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> transcription and replication machinery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, we investigated its genetic association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The NRF1 gene was sequenced to identify polymorphisms in 24 Korean DNA samples and then common variants were genotyped in 766 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 303 non-diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twelve single nucleotide polymorphisms and one insertion/deletion polymorphism were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six common variants among them were genotyped in a larger study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although three individual polymorphisms appeared to be associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (g.-46350insdel A, g.+141G&gt;T and g.+54529A&gt;G), the effects were only marginal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, a haplotype (H2) was associated with a decreased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and another haplotype (H4) was associated with an increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (p values for the Haplo </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We demonstrated that two common haplotypes of NRF1 gene are associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the Korean population </plain></SENT>
