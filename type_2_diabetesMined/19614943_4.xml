<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A two-phase 24-week randomized trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During the first phase, participants were to increase daily steps using a pedometer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At week 12, participants were randomly allocated to either an enhanced lifestyle programme (ELP) targeting walking speed or a basic lifestyle programme (BLP) targeting total daily steps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both programmes focused on increasing the intake of low glycaemic index foods but utilized different goal setting strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical measurements were completed at baseline, week 12 and week 24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Principal outcomes were change in resting pulse rate (PR) and glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (A1c) between week 12 and week 24 compared between groups using analysis of covariance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-one participants [mean +/- s.d. : age = 56.5 +/- 7.2 years, body mass index (BMI) = 32.7 +/- 6.1 kg/m(2)] were randomized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After 12 weeks, we observed an increase in average total daily steps of 1688 (95% confidence interval: 330-3040, [corrected] p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Weight, BMI and systolic and diastolic blood pressure improved (p &lt; 0.01 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No changes were observed for energy intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At week 24, those in the ELP had a lower resting PR (71 +/- 12 b.p.m.) compared with those in the BLP (78 +/- 12 b.p.m.) (adjusted p = 0.03), while no group differences for total daily steps or glycaemic control were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Improvements in cardiovascular health can be expected following a pedometer-based lifestyle modification programme that progresses from walking more to walking faster </plain></SENT>
