<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare the glycemic control of inhaled insulin via the AERx insulin <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> management system (iDMS) with that of subcutaneous (SC) insulin, both combined with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin at bedtime, in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The AERx iDMS uses a liquid insulin formulation to achieve flexible precise mealtime dosing (with increments corresponding to 1 IU administered subcutaneously) and ensures insulin delivery only when the breathing technique is optimal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This trial in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared the glycemic control (HbA(1c)) achieved by inhaled insulin administered via AERx iDMS with that using SC insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This was a randomized, 12-week, open-label, parallel, multicenter, multinational trial in 107 nonsmoking patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (mean age 59 years, mean duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> 11.9 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomized to receive either inhaled fast-acting human insulin via AERx iDMS immediately before meals or SC fast-acting human insulin administered 30 min before meals, both in combination with evening <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Baseline and demographic characteristics were similar between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant difference in HbA(1c) between the AERx and SC groups after 12 weeks of treatment (7.84 +/- 0.77 vs. 7.76 +/- 0.77%, P = 0.60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fasting serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was significantly lower in the AERx group compared with the SC group by the end of the trial (8.9 +/- 3.8 vs. 10.8 +/- 3.7 mmol/l, P = 0.01) with a similar <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> dose in the two groups (0.23 vs. 0.23 IU/kg, P = 0.93) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in the intra-subject variability of fasting or prandial blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> increment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Adverse events were similar in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No major safety concerns were raised during the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, preprandial inhaled insulin via AERx iDMS is as effective as preprandial SC insulin injection in achieving glycemic control with similar tolerability </plain></SENT>
