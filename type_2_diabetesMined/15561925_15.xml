<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, we have recently demonstrated that changes in AMPK activity accompany the exposure of pancreatic islet beta-cells to elevated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations and may be involved in the activation of insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we discuss this hypothesis and explore the potential role of changes in AMPK activity in the actions of other secretagogues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Amino acids decreased AMPK activity in MIN6 beta-cells with an order of potency for inhibition: arg=leu &lt; gln= leu + glu &lt; <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, which was closely correlated with the stimulation of insulin release (r2=0.76) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By contrast, increases in intracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> concentration provoked by cell depolarization with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi> activated AMPK in the face of increased free intracellular ATP concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Elevation of intracellular cAMP levels with isobutylmethylxanthine or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42471">forskolin</z:chebi> had no effect on AMPK activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that metabolizable amino acids regulate AMPK in the beta-cell via increases in the cytosolic ATP/<z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi> ratio and via phosphorylation by the upstream kinase LKB1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> ions may activate AMPK by calmodulin kinase 1 kinase-mediated phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The latter may act as a novel feedback mechanism to inhibit excessive insulin secretion under some circumstances </plain></SENT>
