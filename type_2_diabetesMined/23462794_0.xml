<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The introduction or removal of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi>-phosphate-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16235">guanine</z:chebi> (CpG) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotides</z:chebi>, which are possible sites of DNA methylation, has been suggested as a potential mechanism through which single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can affect gene function via epigenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to examine if any of 40 SNPs previously associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> introduce or remove a CpG site and if these CpG-SNPs are associated with differential DNA methylation in pancreatic islets of 84 human donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: DNA methylation was analysed using pyrosequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that 19 of 40 (48%) type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-associated SNPs introduce or remove a CpG site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Successful DNA methylation data were generated for 16 of these 19 CpG-SNP loci, representing the candidate genes TCF7L2, KCNQ1, PPARG, HHEX, CDKN2A, SLC30A8, DUSP9, CDKAL1, ADCY5, SRR, WFS1, IRS1, DUSP8, HMGA2, TSPAN8 and CHCHD9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> analysed CpG-SNPs were associated with differential DNA methylation of the CpG-SNP site in human islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, six CpG-SNPs, representing TCF7L2, KCNQ1, CDKN2A, ADCY5, WFS1 and HMGA2, were also associated with DNA methylation of surrounding CpG sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Some of the type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> CpG-SNP sites that exhibit differential DNA methylation were further associated with gene expression, alternative splicing events determined by splice index, and hormone secretion in the human islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 19 type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-associated CpG-SNPs are in strong linkage disequilibrium (r (2) &gt; 0.8) with a total of 295 SNPs, including 91 CpG-SNPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that the introduction or removal of a CpG site may be a molecular mechanism through which some of the type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> SNPs affect gene function via differential DNA methylation and consequently contributes to the phenotype of the disease </plain></SENT>
