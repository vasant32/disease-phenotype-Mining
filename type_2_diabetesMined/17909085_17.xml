<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A systematic literature search through July 2007 was conducted to identify randomized placebo-controlled trials of cinnamon that reported data on A1C, fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FBG), or <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean change in each study end point from baseline was treated as a continuous variable, and the weighted mean difference was calculated as the difference between the mean value in the treatment and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A random-effects model was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five prospective randomized controlled trials (n = 282) were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Upon meta-analysis, the use of cinnamon did not significantly alter A1C, FBG, or <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subgroup and sensitivity analyses did not significantly change the results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cinnamon does not appear to improve A1C, FBG, or <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> parameters in patients with type 1 or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
