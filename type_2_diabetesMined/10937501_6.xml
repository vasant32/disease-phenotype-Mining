<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Insulin levels were also determined during the OGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequency of Trp(64)Arg heterozygotes in this population was approximately 7% and was similar in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> and control groups (6.7 vs. 6.9%) as well as in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (BMI &gt; or =27 kg/m2) and the nonobese (6.3 vs. 6.8%) subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> group, BMI, fasting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> index, and diastolic blood pressure were significantly higher in Trp(64)Arg carriers; these differences were no longer observed when <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> was considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the 4 subgroups (control Trp(64)Trp and Trp(64)Arg and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> Trp(64)Trp and Trp(64)Arg), a highly significant trend was evident of an increase in the percentage of subjects with shorter height </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of the Arg(64) allele in Greek pregnant women is relatively rare compared with other ethnic groups and is probably not related to the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> The observed tendency for shorter body height in Arg(64) carriers merits further evaluation in larger population samples </plain></SENT>
