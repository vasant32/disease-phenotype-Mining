<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The KCNQ1 gene (<z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> voltage-gated channel, KQT-like subfamily, member 1) was originally identified as a strong susceptibility gene for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in two Japanese genome-wide association studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within KCNQ1 with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in Japanese subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We genotyped 33 SNPs in KCNQ1 using 754 type 2 diabetic patients with overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> and 558 control subjects (an initial study), and we further examined the association of a candidate SNP using three other independent Japanese populations (replications 1-3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that five SNPs were nominally associated with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, and the association of rs2237897 was the strongest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also found that the T allele frequencies of rs2237897 were consistently higher in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> groups than in the control groups for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> study populations (initial study: 0.33 vs. 0.27; replication 1: 0.32 vs. 0.30; replication 2: 0.33 vs. 0.28; and replication 3: 0.32 vs. 0.28), although the individual associations did not reach statistically significant levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Combined analysis by a meta-analysis revealed that the T allele of rs2237897 was significantly associated with susceptibility to diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in Japanese subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (odds ratio 1.22 [95% CI 1.10-1.34], P = 3.1 x 10(-4), corrected P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that KCNQ1 is a new candidate gene for conferring susceptibility to diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
