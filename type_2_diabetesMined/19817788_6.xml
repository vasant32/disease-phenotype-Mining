<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are two major pathways to beta-cell regeneration, beta-cell replication and beta-cell neogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Substantial evidence for a role for both processes exists in different models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While beta-cell replication clearly occurs during development and early in life, the potential for replication appears to decline substantially with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, we have demonstrated that the exocrine compartment of the adult human pancreas contains a facultative stem cell that can differentiate into beta-cells under specific circumstances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have favoured the idea that, similar to models described in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318485" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver regeneration</z:e>, beta-cell mass can be increased either by neogenesis or replication, depending on the intensity of different stimuli or stressors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Understanding the nature of <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> stem/progenitor cells and the mechanism by which external stimuli mobilize them to exhibit <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> differentiation is central for success in therapeutic approaches to induce meaningful endogenous beta-cell neogenesis </plain></SENT>
