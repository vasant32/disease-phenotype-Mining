<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: After excluding two underweight patients (BMI &lt;18.5 kg/m2), the study population comprised 831 consecutive patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (mean age 61 +/- 9 years) referred for exercise testing for clinical reasons between 1995 and 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Exercise capacity was determined from a maximal exercise test and measured in metabolic equivalents (METs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified both according to BMI category (18.5-24.9, 25.0-29.9, and &gt; or =30 kg/m2) and by exercise capacity (&lt;5.0 or &gt; or =5.0 maximal METs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The association among exercise capacity, BMI, other clinical variables, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality was assessed by Cox proportional hazards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Study participants were followed for mortality up to 30 June 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 4.8 +/- 3.0 years, 112 patients died, for an average annual mortality rate of 2.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Each 1-MET increase in exercise capacity conferred a 10% survival benefit (hazard ratio 0.90 [95% CI 0.82-0.98]; P = 0.01), but BMI was not significantly associated with mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for age, ethnicity, examination year, BMI, presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk factors, diabetic patients achieving &lt;5 maximal METs were 70% more likely to die (1.70 [1.13-2.54]) than those achieving &gt; or =5 maximal METs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There was a strong inverse association between exercise capacity and mortality in this cohort of men with documented <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and this relationship was independent of BMI </plain></SENT>
