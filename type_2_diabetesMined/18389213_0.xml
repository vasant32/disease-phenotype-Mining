<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined whether recently developed photoactivatable/photoconvertible proteins are a useful tool for studying this process at the single granule level in insulin-secreting cells after <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Plasmids were generated for expression of fusion proteins of the granule membrane phosphatase phogrin or the granule cargo protein neuropeptide Y (NPY) with the photoactivatable green fluorescent protein mutant A206K (PA-GFP-A206K), the photoconvertible protein Dendra2 and the fluorescent protein mCherry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transfected insulin-secreting MIN6 cells were analysed by fluorescence microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Point-resolved 405 nm light exposure during image acquisition of MIN6 cells transiently transfected with Phogrin-PA-GFP-A206K or NPY-PA-GFP-A206K as well as of stable MIN6-Phogrin-Dendra2 cells resulted in selective visualisation of few granules by green or red fluorescence, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Movement of these granules was analysed by an automated tracking method from confocal 3D image series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The high spatiotemporal resolution facilitated an elongated tracking of single granules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the track speed and track displacement of granules after 1 h starvation and subsequent <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> stimulation was lower in cells pre-cultured for 48 h at 3 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> than in cells pre-cultured at 25 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Targeting of the granule membrane or its cargo with a photoactivatable/photoconvertible protein allows in-depth visualisation and tracking of single insulin granules in dependence upon <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This technique may also open the way to elucidating the regulation of granule movement velocity within the pancreatic beta cell with respect to secretory defects in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
