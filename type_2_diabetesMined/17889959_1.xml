<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> receptor blocker (ARB) improves <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, whether this is a direct effect of ARB or through lowering blood pressure is still controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to determine the direct effect of ARB on diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four type 2 diabetic patients with early kidney damage were divided into two groups: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> group (n=17) and control group (n=17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> group, low dose (25mg) of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> was administered once daily for a year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure at home, blood pressure at office and urinary albumin/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio (UACR) were measured before and during the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After a 1-year observation, the increment of UACR was significantly smaller in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> group than that in control group [-23.8+/-13.7 mg/gCr vs. 15.9+/-13.2mg/gCr, mean+/-S.E.M., P=0.0114] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean blood pressure levels did not change before and during the observation period both in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> group and control group, though only systolic blood pressure at home decreased slightly but significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the levels of HbA(1c), fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> and body mass index between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The observed decrease in UACR in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi>-treated group might be attributed to a direct renoprotective action in addition to a subtle decrease in systolic blood pressure at home </plain></SENT>
