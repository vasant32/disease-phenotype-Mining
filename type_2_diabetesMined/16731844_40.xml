<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The role of oxidative phosphorylation in adipose tissue was elucidated from results of Affymetrix gene profiling in subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue of eight nonobese healthy, eight <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> healthy, and eight <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> type 2 diabetic women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Downregulation of several genes in the electron transport chain was the most prominent finding in visceral fat of type 2 diabetic women independent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, but the gene pattern was distinct from that previously reported in skeletal muscle in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A similar but much weaker effect was observed in subcutaneous fat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is a major factor behind <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in adipose tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TNF-alpha treatment decreased <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of electron transport chain genes and also inhibited fatty acid oxidation when differentiated human preadipocytes were treated with the cytokine for 48 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is associated with a tissue- and region-specific downregulation of oxidative phosphorylation genes that is independent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and at least in part mediated by TNF-alpha, suggesting that impaired oxidative phosphorylation of visceral adipose tissue has pathogenic importance for development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
