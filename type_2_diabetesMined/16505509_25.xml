<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the natural history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral arterial disease</z:hpo> (PAD) complicating type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, in particular the influence of PAD on the risk of cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and the adequacy of PAD risk factor management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The Fremantle <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study (FDS) was a prospective community-based observational study of diabetic patients recruited between 1993 and 1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present sample comprised the 1,294 FDS type 2 diabetic patients and a subgroup of 531 of these who had valid data at baseline and five or more subsequent consecutive annual reviews </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Assessments consisted of a range of clinical and biochemical variables including the ankle/brachial index (ABI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PAD was defined as an ABI &lt; or =0.90 at two consecutive reviews or any PAD-related lower-extremity <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of PAD at study entry was 13.6% and the incidence of new PAD was 3.7 per 100 patient-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both prevalent and incident PAD was strongly and independently associated with increasing age, systolic blood pressure, total serum cholesterol, and especially smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Risk factor management improved but remained suboptimal during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An ABI of &lt; or =0.90 was independently associated with an increased risk of cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of 67% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Measurement of the ABI is a simple means of identifying PAD in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>PAD is common in diabetic patients and predicts cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data further support the role of regular screening for PAD in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> so that intensive management of vascular risk factors can be pursued </plain></SENT>
