<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the association between hematocrit, stratified by the presence of CKD, and cardiovascular events in a cohort of Chinese subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 3,983 patients who underwent assessment for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> complications were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects were categorized into five groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Group I included subjects with hematocrit below the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sex-specific range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cutoff points for groups II-V were selected to represent the distribution of the hematocrit for each sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CKD was defined by the estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt;60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular events were defined as cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, including new <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndrome, revascularization, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> requiring hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 294 subjects (7.4%) developed cardiovascular events during the median of 36.4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The rate of cardiovascular events was highest in subjects with low hematocrit (group I, 18.6%) compared with group V (3.4%, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio for cardiovascular events diminished with increasing hematocrit (group I, 1.0; group II, 0.73 [95% CI 0.51-1.04]; group III, 0.57 [0.39-0.83]; group IV, 0.61 [0.39-0.95]; and group V, 0.36 [0.17-0.79]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After stratifying by the presence of CKD, the previously observed reduction in the risk of developing cardiovascular events with increasing hematocrit was abolished in the cohort with CKD but persisted in the non-CKD cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In Chinese subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, low levels of hematocrit and the presence of CKD are associated with increased risk of developing adverse cardiovascular events </plain></SENT>
