<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The frequency of a positive family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in diabetic patients has increased in recent studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, it was 16-33% for type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 43-49% for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was significantly higher than in non-diabetic subjects, and in type 2 than in type 1 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in parents and siblings of type 2 diabetic patients was higher than in those of type 1 patients, and it was particularly high in parents of young <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among type 2 diabetic patients, positive family history was somewhat lower in those with marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in the past </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparison of groups with varying degrees of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> revealed that a family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> increased in parallel with the impairment of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that genetic factors in the pathogenesis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are more important in type 2 than in type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and in the younger <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and less <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects than in older <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and more <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
