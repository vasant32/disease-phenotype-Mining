<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We now report the safety and efficacy of exenatide QW in 1) patients who continued treatment for an additional 22 weeks (52 weeks total) and 2) patients who switched from exenatide BID to exenatide QW after 30 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this randomized, multicenter, comparator-controlled, open-label trial, 258 patients entered the 22-week open-ended assessment phase (n = 128 QW-only; n = 130 BID--&gt;QW) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A1C, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG), body weight, blood pressure, fasting <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, safety, and tolerability were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients continuing exenatide QW maintained A1C improvements through 52 weeks (least squares mean -2.0% [95% CI -2.1 to -1.8%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients switching from exenatide BID to exenatide QW achieved further A1C improvements; both groups exhibited the same A1C reduction and mean A1C (6.6%) at week 52 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At week 52, 71 and 54% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients achieved A1C &lt;7.0% and &lt;or=6.5%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In both treatment arms, FPG was reduced by &gt;40 mg/dl, and body weight was reduced by &gt;4 kg after 52 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>Nausea</z:hpo> occurred less frequently in this assessment period and was predominantly mild </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Exenatide QW elicited sustained improvements in glycemic control and body weight through 52 weeks of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients switching to exenatide QW experienced further improvements in A1C and FPG, with sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
