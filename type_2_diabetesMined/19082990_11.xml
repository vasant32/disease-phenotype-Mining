<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, whether G6PC2 variants have a similar effect in other ethnic groups is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of common variants of G6PC2 on type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and related clinical features in a Chinese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We selected four SNPs, rs13387347, rs2232316, rs492594 and rs16856187, tagging <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the common variants spanning the G6PC2 gene (r(2) &gt;or= 0.8) based on HapMap Chinese data, and genotyped them in a group of 3,676 Shanghai Chinese individuals, comprising 1,876 cases and 1,800 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three SNPs were nominally associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, with rs16856187 showing the strongest evidence for association (p = 0.0009, empirical p = 0.0047) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further conditional analysis revealed that the association signal arose from an individual SNP, rs16856187 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This SNP was also associated with fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level in participants with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> regulation (p = 0.0002), with the fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level observed to increase by 0.067 mmol/l with each copy of the rare C allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In this study we identified a novel risk-conferring G6PC2 SNP for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a Chinese population and confirmed the previous finding that G6PC2 variants are associated with fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration </plain></SENT>
