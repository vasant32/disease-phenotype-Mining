<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The emerging picture of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> genetics involves differently assembled gene variants, each modestly increasing risk with environmental exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the relevance of these genes for disease prediction has not been extensively tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed 19 common polymorphisms of 14 known candidate genes for their contribution to prevalence and incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> in the DESIR (Data from an Epidemiological Study on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin Resistance</z:hpo> syndrome) prospective study of middle-aged Caucasian subjects, including 3,877 participants (16.8% with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> and 7.9% with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after the 9-year study) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The GCK (Glucokinase) -30A allele was associated with increased type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk at the end of the follow-up study (adjusted OR 1.34 [95% CI 1.07-1.69]) under an additive model, as supported in independent French diabetic case subjects (OR 1.22, P = 0.007), with increased fasting glycemia (0.85% per A allele, P = 6 x 10(-5)) and decreased homeostasis model assessment of beta-cell function (4%, P = 0.0009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IL6 (Interleukin- 6) -174 G/C interacts with age in disease risk and modulates fasting glycemia according to age (1.36% decrease over 56 years, P = 5 x 10(-5)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These polymorphisms together with KCNJ11 (Kir6.2)-E23K and TCF7L2-rs7903146 may predict <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence in the DESIR cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Each additional risk allele at GCK, TCF7L2, and IL6 increased risk by 1.34 (P = 2 x 10(-6)), with an OR of 2.48 (95% CI 1.59-3.86), in carriers of at least four at-risk alleles compared with those with none or one risk allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirm several at-risk polymorphisms for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a general population and demonstrate that prospective studies are valuable designs to complement classical genetic approaches </plain></SENT>
