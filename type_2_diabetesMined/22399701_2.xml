<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used prospective observational data from Veterans Affairs Medical Centers in Washington, DC, and Palo Alto, California </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our cohort (N = 4,156; mean age 60 ± 10.3 years) consisted of 2,013 African Americans (mean age, 59.5 ± 9.9 years), 2,000 Caucasians (mean age, 60.8 ± 10.5 years), and 143 of unknown race/ethnicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BMI, cardiac risk factors, medications, and peak exercise capacity in metabolic equivalents (METs) were assessed during 1986 and 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo>-cause mortality was assessed across BMI and fitness categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 1,074 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> during a median follow-up period of 7.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A paradoxic BMI-mortality association was observed, with significantly higher risk among those with a BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 kg/m(2) (hazard ratio [HR] 1.70 [95% CI 1.36-2.1]) compared with the <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> category (BMI ≥ 35 kg/m(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This association was accentuated in African Americans (HR 1.95 [95% CI 1.44-2.63]) versus Caucasians (HR 1.53 [1.0-2.1]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The fitness-mortality risk association for the entire cohort and within BMI categories was inverse, independent, and graded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mortality risks were 12% lower for each 1-MET increase in exercise capacity, and ~35-55% lower for those with an exercise capacity &gt;5 METs compared with the least fit (≤ 5 METs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS A paradoxic BMI-mortality risk association was observed in African American and Caucasian patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The exercise capacity-mortality risk association was inverse, independent, and graded in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> BMI categories but was more potent in those with a BMI ≥ 25 kg/m(2) </plain></SENT>
