<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we report the reanalysis of data from 573 U.K. sibships ascertained for multiplex type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, using age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (assessed by the proxy measure of age at diagnosis) as the phenotype of interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genome-wide evidence for linkage to age at diagnosis was evaluated using both variance components and Haseman-Elston (HECOM) regression approaches, with extensive simulations to derive empirical significance values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was broad agreement across analyses with six regions of interest (logarithm of odds [LOD] &gt;/==" BORDER="0"&gt;1.18) identified on chromosomes 1qter, 4p15-4q12, 5p15, 12p13-12q13, 12q24, and 14q12-14q21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The strongest empirically "suggestive" evidence for linkage comes from regions on chromosome 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The first region (12p13-12q13), peaking at D12S310 (variance components LOD [LOD(VC)] = 2.08, empirical pointwise P = 0.0007; HECOM LOD [LOD(HECOM)] = 2.58, P = 0.0010) seems to be novel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The second (12q24) peaking between D12S324 and D12S1659 (LOD(VC) = 1.87, P = 0.0016; LOD(HECOM) = 1.93, P = 0.0027) overlaps a region showing substantial prior evidence for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> linkage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data provide additional evidence that genes mapping to these chromosomal regions are involved in the susceptibility to, and/or development of, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
