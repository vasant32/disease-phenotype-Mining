<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The incretin hormones gastric inhibitory <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> and especially glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (GLP) have an important physiological function in augmenting postprandial insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since GLP-1 may play a role in the pathophysiology and treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, assessment of meal-related GLP-1 secretory responses in type 2 diabetic patients vs healthy individuals is of great interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A common view states that GLP-1 secretion in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is deficient and that this applies to a lesser degree in individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Such a deficiency is the rationale for replacing endogenous incretins with GLP-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> or re-normalising active GLP-1 concentrations with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This review summarises the literature on this topic, including a meta-analysis of published studies on GLP-1 secretion in individuals with and without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and mixed meals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our analysis does not support the contention of a generalised defect in nutrient-related GLP-1 secretory responses in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rather, factors are identified that may determine individual incretin secretory responses and explain some of the variations in published findings of group differences in GLP-1 responses to nutrient intake </plain></SENT>
