<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>LY465608 altered PPAR-responsive genes in liver and fat of db/db mice and dose-dependently lowered plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in hyperglycemic male <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats, with an ED(50) for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> normalization of 3.8 mg small middle dot kg(-1) small middle dot day(-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Metabolic improvements were associated with enhanced insulin sensitivity, as demonstrated in female <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> (fa/fa) rats using both oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests and hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Further characterization of LY465608 revealed metabolic changes distinct from a selective PPAR-gamma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, which were presumably due to the concomitant PPAR-alpha agonism, lower respiratory quotient, and less fat accumulation, despite a similar impact on glycemia in male ZDF rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition to these alterations in diabetic and insulin-resistant animals, LY465608 dose-dependently elevated <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> and lowered plasma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> in human <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> A-I transgenic mice, demonstrating that this compound significantly improves primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, these studies demonstrate that LY465608 beneficially impacts multiple facets of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and associated cardiovascular risk, including those facets involved in the development of micro- and macrovascular complications, which are the major sources for morbidity and mortality in these patients </plain></SENT>
