<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We compared plasma interleukin (IL)-18 concentrations in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with those in age-matched control subjects and investigated whether plasma IL-18 was associated with plasma total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> (tHcy) concentration or carotid intimal-media wall thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>), an early marker of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We measured plasma IL-18 in 103 type 2 diabetic patients and 45 age-matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also measured patients' plasma tHcy and serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> was evaluated for both common carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Plasma IL-18 was significantly higher in diabetic patients than in control subjects (203 +/- 153 vs. 118 +/- 37 pg/ml, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High IL-18 was defined as equaling or exceeding the mean + 2 SD of plasma IL-18 in control subjects (192 pg/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with high IL-18 showed a greater carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> than those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> IL-18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Carotid plaques were more numerous in diabetic patients with high IL-18 than in those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> IL-18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Plasma tHcy concentrations were significantly higher in patients with high IL-18 than in those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> IL-18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate analyses showed a strong independent association between tHcy and IL-18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Plasma IL-18 also correlated positively with serum hs-CRP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, plasma IL-18 concentrations are greater than in nondiabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Plasma IL-18 is an independent determinant of plasma tHcy, which is linked independently with atherosclerotic carotid wall thickening </plain></SENT>
