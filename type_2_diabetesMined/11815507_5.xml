<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Repaglinide, a novel <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> agent that has a rapid <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and short duration of action, was developed for mealtime dosing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this pharmacodynamic study was to validate a prandial regimen of repaglinide by comparing meal-related dosing with a regimen in which the same total daily dose was divided into only two doses at morning and evening meals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study was a double-blind, randomized, parallel-group trial in 19 antidiabetic agent-naive subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (mean age 58 years, known duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> 3.5 years, HbA(1c) 7.3%, and BMI 32 kg/m(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomly assigned to receive repaglinide either before each of the three main meals or before breakfast and before the evening meal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients in both groups received the same total daily dose of repaglinide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hour profiles of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, plasma insulin, and plasma C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> concentrations were measured at baseline and after 4 weeks of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Repaglinide increased postprandial insulin levels and markedly reduced postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels relative to baseline in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant reductions were also recorded in fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and HbA(1c) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The repaglinide regimen, in which a dose was taken before each main meal, was more effective in improving glycemic control (including postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and HbA(1c) levels) than the same total dose of repaglinide divided into morning and evening mealtime doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data support the strategy of mealtime dosing with repaglinide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The improvements in glycemic control observed in these patients are encouraging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition to classic parameters of glycemic control, improvements in postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excursions may prove to be important because <z:hpo ids='HP_0011998'>postprandial hyperglycemia</z:hpo> has been suggested to be an independent risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
