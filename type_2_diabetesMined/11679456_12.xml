<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 2,759 men and 3,464 women (40-78 years of age) without a previous diagnosis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were recruited from a population-based sampling frame </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diet was assessed using a self-reported semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The HbA(1c) level was negatively associated with the polyunsaturated fat-to-saturated fat ratio (P:S ratio) of the diet (beta = -0.0338 HbA(1c)% per SD change in P:S ratio; P &lt; 0.001) and positively associated with the total level of fat intake (beta = 0.0620 HbA(1c)% per SD change in total fat intake; P &lt; 0.001), adjusted for age and total energy intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The associations remained significant when adjusted for each other and for total energy, protein, age, sex, family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, physical activity, and smoking (for P:S ratio, beta = -0.0200 HbA(1c)% per SD change in P:S ratio, P = 0.013; for total fat, beta = 0.420% HbA(1c)% per SD change in total fat intake, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The benefits from a high P:S ratio were attributed to a lower saturated fat intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate independent associations between HbA(1c) concentration across the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range of HbA(1c) and both total fat intake and the pattern of dietary fat intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They provide further support to efforts promoting modifications in the intake of dietary fat </plain></SENT>
