<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271686" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic autonomic neuropathy</z:e> (DAN) have an increased cardiovascular mortality rate compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> or diabetic patients without DAN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Indices of standard cardiovascular autonomic function tests and heart rate variability (HRV) are reliable markers of the presence and severity of DAN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The present prospective study investigated the natural history of values of HRV indices and cardiovascular reflex tests in patients with recently diagnosed asymptomatic DAN, over a period of 2 years, at 3 month intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 30 consecutive patients (nine men and 21 women), of median age 51 (range 25-65) years, eight with type 1 and 22 with Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, were included in the study, at the time that the presence of DAN was confirmed, as this was established if at least two of cardiovascular autonomic function tests became abnormal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expiration/inspiration (E/I) ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>S.D. and mean circular resultant of R-R intervals, the Valsalva index, the 30:15 ratio, and the blood pressure response to standing as well as normalised spectral power indices of HRV were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> measured indices, except the Valsalva index, deteriorated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 30 patients during the 2 year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most of HRV indices values deteriorated significantly in comparison to baseline at month 12, while the values of cardiovascular reflex tests displayed significant deterioration, in comparison to baseline, between months 15 and 21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients developed symptoms of DAN during the 2 year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with better glycemic control exhibited deterioration of DAN markers at the same time period with those with poor glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the progression of DAN is significant during the 2 years subsequent to its discovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This was defined by the deterioration of the mean values of HRV indices and standard cardiovascular autonomic function tests, and by the development of autonomic symptoms in some patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>HRV indices are the earlier markers of DAN deterioration </plain></SENT>
