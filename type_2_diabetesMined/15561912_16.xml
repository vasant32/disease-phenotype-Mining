<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The rapid degradation of native GLP-1 has engendered interest in more stable longer-acting GLP-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> such as exendin-4 (Ex-4); however, the potential consequences of sustained GLP-1 receptor activation leading to receptor desensitization has not been extensively studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have now examined a range of GLP-1 receptor-dependent responses following treatment with Ex-4 using INS-1 cells in vitro and both <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> control and MT-Ex-4 transgenic mice in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although both GLP-1 and Ex-4 acutely desensitized GLP-1 receptor-dependent cAMP accumulation in INS-1 cells, Ex-4 produced more sustained receptor desensitization, relative to GLP-1, in both <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> (5-120 min) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> (24-72 h) experiments </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MT-Ex-4 transgenic mice exhibited a reduced glycemic response to oral but not intraperitoneal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> challenge following <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> Ex-4 administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, no differences in glycemic excursion or plasma insulin were observed after 1 week of twice-daily Ex-4 administration to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> versus MT-Ex-4 mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the levels of insulin, pdx-1, and GLP-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> transcripts were comparable in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and MT-Ex-4 transgenic mice after 1 week of Ex-4 administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, repeated Ex-4 administration significantly reduced food intake in MT-Ex-4 but not in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings illustrate that although Ex-4 is more potent than native GLP-1 in producing GLP-1 receptor desensitization in vitro, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> exposure to Ex-4 in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or transgenic mice is not associated with significant downregulation of GLP-1 receptor-dependent responses coupled to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis in vivo </plain></SENT>
