<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity were assessed with the Botnia clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Heteroplasmy of the A3243G mutation and variants in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility genes were determined, and transcriptional activity, DNA binding, and subcellular localization of mutated HNF1alpha were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirteen family members carried the mutation in mtDNA; 6 of them also had the M626K mutation, whereas none had only the M626K mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The protective Ala12 allele in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)gamma was present in two nondiabetic individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Carriers of both mtDNA and HNF1alpha mutations showed an earlier age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than carriers of only the mtDNA mutation (median 22 vs. 45 years) but no clear difference in beta-cell function or insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vitro, the M626K mutation caused a 53% decrease in transcriptional activity in HeLa cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mutated protein showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> nuclear targeting but increased DNA binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that several genetic factors might contribute to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk, even in families with mtDNA and HNF1alpha mutations </plain></SENT>
