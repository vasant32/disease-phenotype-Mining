<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms underlying the first phase of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin release, the deterioration of which marks the early stages of both type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, are essentially unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among many hypotheses, one holds that the first phase is due to a readily releasable pool of insulin-containing granules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used current knowledge of the mechanisms of exocytosis and the proteins involved in docking granules at the plasma membrane to test this hypothesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A docked pool of readily releasable granules was identified by immunoprecipitation of the plasma membrane protein syntaxin with a specific antibody and by co-immunoprecipitation of soluble <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44485">N-ethylmaleimide</z:chebi>-sensitive factor attachment protein-25 (SNAP-25) and the granule proteins synaptobrevin and synaptotagmin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The four SNARE proteins co-immunoprecipitated each other, thus identifying the core complex associated with docked granules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using co-immunoprecipitation as a marker for docked granules, we found that the docked pool was rapidly discharged during the first phase of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin release and refilled during the second phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other secretagogues also released the pool, whereas the physiological inhibitor <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> blocked its release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further studies on the nature of this pool of granules should shed light on the causes of its deterioration in the early stages of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the reasons for deficient insulin release </plain></SENT>
