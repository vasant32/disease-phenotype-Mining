<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Accumulating evidence indicates that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> lipase (LPL) produced by macrophages in the vascular wall may favor the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> by promoting <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> accumulation within the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We previously demonstrated that high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> stimulates in vitro murine and human macrophage LPL production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we measured macrophage LPL <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression, immunoreactive mass, and activity in normotriglyceridemic subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Monocytes isolated from healthy control subjects and patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were differentiated into macrophages in RPMI medium containing 20% autologous serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 5 days in culture, macrophage LPL <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression, mass, and activity were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Macrophages of diabetic patients cultured in their own sera showed a significant increase in LPL <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels, mass, and activity compared with macrophages of control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Differentiation of macrophages of diabetic patients in sera obtained from control subjects significantly reduced these anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conversely, culturing macrophages of control subjects in sera of diabetic patients significantly increased LPL mass and activity in these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Besides LPL overproduction, macrophages of diabetic patients exhibited an increase in basal and LPL-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF)-alpha release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>TNF-alpha alterations were reduced by exposing these cells to sera of control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall, these data demonstrate that macrophages of diabetic patients overexpress LPL and TNF-alpha and that peripheral factors dysregulated in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are, at least in part, responsible for these alterations </plain></SENT>
