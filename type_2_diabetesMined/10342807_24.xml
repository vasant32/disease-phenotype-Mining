<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The recently identified uncoupling protein-3 (UCP-3) gene, predicted to encode a new member of the family of uncoupling proteins, is preferentially expressed in skeletal muscle and has been related to phenotypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have established that during mouse ontogeny, the expression of the UCP-3 gene is switched on in skeletal muscle just after birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The induction of UCP-3 gene expression is dependent on the initiation of suckling and particularly on <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment of newborn mice with activators of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3750">clofibrate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47612">bezafibrate</z:chebi>, or (4-chloro-6-(2,3-xylidine)-pirimidinylthio)<z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32509">WY 14,643</z:chebi>), mimics the action of food intake on UCP-3 gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The specific ligand of PPAR-alpha <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32509">WY 14,643</z:chebi> induces UCP-3 gene expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner, whereas the thiazolidinedione <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">BRL 49653</z:chebi>, specific for PPAR-gamma, has no effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These treatments act without altering circulating free fatty acids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During development, skeletal muscle expresses constitutive levels of PPAR-delta <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, whereas expression of the PPAR-gamma gene is undetectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PPAR-alpha gene expression is developmentally regulated in muscle as it is first expressed at birth, just before UCP-3 gene induction occurs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The induction of UCP-3 gene expression by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32509">WY 14,643</z:chebi> is impaired in skeletal muscle of premature neonates, which do not express PPAR-alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is proposed that the UCP-3 gene is predominantly regulated in neonatal muscle by PPAR-alpha activation </plain></SENT>
