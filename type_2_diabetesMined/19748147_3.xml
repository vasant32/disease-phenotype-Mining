<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Lyso-PC was measured by electrospray ionization-liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Paraoxonase and HTLase activities were measured with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27827">paraoxon</z:chebi> and gamma-thiobutyrolactone as substrates, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum HTLase and paraoxonase activities were significantly suppressed in diabetic patients (n=96) compared with control (n=25), whereas serum Lp-<z:chebi fb="79" ids="53407">PLA</z:chebi>(2) did not differ in control and diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lyso-PC contents in <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> correlated with serum Lp-<z:chebi fb="79" ids="53407">PLA</z:chebi>(2) activity positively and with serum HTLase activity negatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stepwise regression analysis revealed that serum Lp-<z:chebi fb="79" ids="53407">PLA</z:chebi>(2) and HTLase activities independently contributed to lyso-PC contents in <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, lyso-PC contents in <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> were increased with reduced serum HTLase and paraoxonase activities compared with control, while serum Lp-<z:chebi fb="79" ids="53407">PLA</z:chebi>(2) activity did not differ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, 3-month treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> reduced both lyso-PC contents in <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> and serum Lp-<z:chebi fb="79" ids="53407">PLA</z:chebi>(2) activity in hypercholesterolemic diabetic patients, while serum HTLase or paraoxonase activities did not change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Increased lyso-PC contents in <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> were associated with the suppressed HTLase activity, and serum Lp-<z:chebi fb="79" ids="53407">PLA</z:chebi>(2) and HTLase activities may be related to lyso-PC in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
