<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The actions of AGEs are mediated both through a non-receptor-mediated pathway and through specific receptors for AGE (RAGEs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To explore a specific role for RAGE in renal changes in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we examined the renal effects of a neutralizing murine RAGE antibody in db/db mice, a model of <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One group of db/db mice was treated for 2 months with the RAGE antibody, and another db/db group was treated for the same period with an irrelevant IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two groups of nondiabetic db/+ mice were treated with either RAGE antibody or isotype-matched IgG for 2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Placebo-treated db/db mice showed a pronounced increase in kidney weight, glomerular volume, basement membrane thickness (BMT), total mesangial volume, urinary albumin excretion (UAE), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance compared with nondiabetic controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In RAGE antibody-treated db/db mice, the increase in kidney weight, glomerular volume, mesangial volume, and UAE was reduced, whereas the increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance and BMT was fully normalized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Notably, these effects in db/db mice were seen without impact on body weight, blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin levels, or food consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, RAGE is an important pathogenetic factor in the renal changes in an animal model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
