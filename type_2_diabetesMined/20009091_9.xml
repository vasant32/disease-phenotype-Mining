<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Veterans who received primary care at the VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System from June 2004 to December 2005, who were taking oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi> and/or insulin for &gt; or =1 year, and who had A1C &gt; or =7.5% at enrollment were randomly assigned to either active care management with home telemonitoring (ACM+HT group, n = 73) or a monthly care coordination telephone call (CC group, n = 77) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both groups received monthly calls for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> education and self-management review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ACM+HT group participants transmitted blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, blood pressure, and weight to a nurse practitioner using the Viterion 100 TeleHealth Monitor; the nurse practitioner adjusted medications for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, blood pressure, and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> control based on established American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Measures were obtained at baseline, 3-month, and 6-month visits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS Baseline characteristics were similar in both groups, with mean A1C of 9.4% (CC group) and 9.6% (ACM+HT group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with the CC group, the ACM+HT group demonstrated significantly larger decreases in A1C at 3 months (1.7 vs. 0.7%) and 6 months (1.7 vs. 0.8%; P &lt; 0.001 for each), with most improvement occurring by 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS Compared with the CC group, the ACM+HT group demonstrated significantly greater reductions in A1C by 3 and 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, both interventions improved glycemic control in primary care patients with previously inadequate control </plain></SENT>
