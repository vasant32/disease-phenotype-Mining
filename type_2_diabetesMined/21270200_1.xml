<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: An ABI was obtained in 2,240 patients in the Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> (BARI 2D) Trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ABIs were classified as: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, 0.91-1.3; low, â‰¤ 0.9; high, &gt;1.3; or noncompressible artery (NC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Baseline characteristics were examined according to ABI and by multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS ABI was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 66%, low in 19%, and high in 8% of patients, and 6% of patients had NC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the low ABI patients, 68% were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ABI as referent, low ABI was independently associated with smoking, female sex, black race, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, age, C-reactive protein, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration, and lower BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>High ABI was associated with male sex, nonblack race, and higher BMI; and NC artery was associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration, higher BMI, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ABI abnormalities are common and often asymptomatic in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and CAD </plain></SENT>
