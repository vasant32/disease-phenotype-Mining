<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The early stages of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> are characterized by the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (IRe) in muscle cells and adipocytes with the concomitant loss of beta-cell compensation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have extensively reviewed the literature related to metabolic and signalling pathways of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in regard to the coordinated development of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and IRe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We considered the hypothesis that <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> leads to IRe in muscle cells and adipocytes, but found that the data are more consistent with the hypothesis that the cellular mechanisms that protect against <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> per se are capable of creating an ROS-dependent insulin-resistant state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, ROS-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction can lead to disruptions of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism, increasing the intracellular <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> content, and, in addition, contribute to <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-dependent IRe in myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Together, these two ROS-activated pathways to IRe can contribute to a global state of profound resistance to insulin action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic strategies should, therefore, be directed towards reducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> without an increase in ROS production or concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pharmacological or other approaches to IRe that result in the activation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> biogenesis in particular could be highly beneficial in the prevention or treatment of both <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
