<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, these impressive benefits conflict with results from observational studies and randomised controlled trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to show that these findings are caused by a flawed design that introduced immortal time bias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We illustrate the bias in the ROSSO study and demonstrate that it is large enough to completely explain the apparently protective effect of SMBG on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the ROSSO study, patients were classified as exposed to SMBG for their whole follow-up time if they performed self-monitoring for at least 1 year during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, the time between cohort entry and the date after 1 year self-monitoring was performed is unavoidably 'immortal' for patients with SMBG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients had to survive at least 1 year to be classified as exposed to this intervention and were artificially 'protected' from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on published information, the total amount of misclassified immortal person-time in the SMBG group is at least 5,082 of 9,248 person-years at risk (55%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After re-classification of immortal person-time as unexposed, the unadjusted relative risk changed from 0.59 to 1.95 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The apparently protective effect of SMBG on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality observed in the ROSSO study is completely explained by immortal time bias </plain></SENT>
