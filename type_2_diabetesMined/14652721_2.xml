<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical tests are limited to heart rate variability and blood pressure measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether a detailed analysis of postural reflexes of patients during short-term head-up tilting and standing erect (both for 3 min) would provide useful clinical data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 14 control subjects and 56 patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, stratified into four matched groups: uncomplicated, micro-<z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp>, macro-<z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0259749" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autonomic neuropathy</z:e>, who were tilted 55 degrees three times and were standing erect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Non-invasive finger plethysmography blood pressure measurements, using the Portapres, and impedance cardiac output measurements, using the RheoCardioMonitor, were continuously recorded throughout the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Wavelets of the response to tilting and standing were drawn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The wavelets for the three tilts were combined to improve definition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002459'>autonomic dysfunction</z:hpo> was quantified by calculating the baroreflex sensitivity index from the heart-rate and blood-pressure variability data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Baroreflex sensitivity data confirmed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002459'>autonomic dysfunction</z:hpo> increased as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> worsened (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both standing and tilting resulted in an initial decrease in blood pressure followed by recovery, an increase in heart rate which was more pronounced with standing and a decrease in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Characteristic and incremental changes in these responses were noted as the complications of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> worsened (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These were a greater decrease in blood pressure with loss of the recovery phase, a <z:mp ids='MP_0005333'>reduced heart-rate</z:mp> response and paradoxically an increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: Non-invasive blood-pressure and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-volume measurements recorded during short-term tilting and standing promises to be useful in assessing diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002459'>autonomic dysfunction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
