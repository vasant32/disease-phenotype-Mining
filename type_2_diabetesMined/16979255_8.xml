<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the superiority of insulin glargine as basal insulin replacement by continuous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring system (CGMS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) whose blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was not well controlled with sulphanylureas were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At first, they were treated with extended-release glipizide (glucotrol XL) 5mg/d before breakfast for 2 weeks, then randomized to combination treatment with glargine (16 patients) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> (8 patients) and treated for 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CGMS were carried in the second week after treatment with glucotrol XL, and in the 12th week after combination treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The data of CGMS showed: (1) When FPG were well controlled in both groups (glargine group versus <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> group: 6.0+/-1.0 mmol/L versus 5.8+/-1.3 mmol/L), the blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level at 3:00 a.m </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(5.1+/-0.9 mmol/L versus 4.2+/-0.8 mmol/L) were higher (P&lt;0.05), TPG&lt; or =3.0 mmol/L at night were lower (2.56+/-1.79 versus 5.88+/-1.96), and the rate of nocturnal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> (1/16 versus 4/8) were less (P=0.028) in glargine group than those in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(2) CGMS showed that the daily blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> profile excursion were more smoother in glargine group than those in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, it was confirmed with CGMS that compared with traditionally basal insulin replacement with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e>, the combination treatment with glargine injection at bedtime may be predominant for stabilizing the daily blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> profile excursion and decreasing the nocturnal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> events incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>So glargine may be a more ideal basal insulin replacement than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
