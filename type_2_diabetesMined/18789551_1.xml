<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To determine how serum concentrations of resistin are distributed in humans in relation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cross-sectional, descriptive study carried out in a random sample (n=713, 43% men, 18-75 years) of general population of inhabitants of the Canary Islands (Spain) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum resistin concentration, HOMA2-IR, anthropometric parameters, drug consumption and physical activity were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no differences in resistin concentration between participants with and without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (3.1+/-0.2 vs. 3.2+/-0.1ng/mL; p=0.566), or between <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> participants (3.1+/-0.1 vs. 3.2+/-0.1ng/mL; p=0.803) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Individuals with abdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (waist-hip ratio [WHR] &gt;or=1 in men or &gt;or=0.9 in women) had lower concentrations of resistin (3.0+/-0.13 vs. 3.4+/-0.1ng/mL; p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The correlations between resistin and HOMA2-IR (r=-0.231; p&lt;0.001) and between resistin and WHR (r=-0.202; p&lt;0.001) were inverse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis corroborated the inverse association of this cytokine with HOMA2-IR, WHR and, in women, also retained in the model the direct association between resistin and physical activity and the inverse association between resistin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this population resistin is inversely associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and abdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
