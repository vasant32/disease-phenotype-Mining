<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the impact of a 12-week walking program on body composition and risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> in women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and in normoglycemic women with first-degree diabetic relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: There were 11 postmenopausal women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 20 normoglycemic women of similar age and BMI who were asked to walk 1 h per day on 5 days each week for 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fitness (estimated VO2max) was assessed with a 1.6-km walking test; body composition was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry; and <z:chebi fb="25" ids="50112">sex hormone</z:chebi>, metabolic, and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> concentrations were measured in serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 12 weeks, estimated VO2max improved in both groups (P &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the diabetic women, BMI and fat content of the upper body and android waist region decreased (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Concentrations of fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.05) HbAlc (P &lt; 0.05), total cholesterol (P &lt; 0.005), and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.05) decreased, while <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> and sex hormones were unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, normoglycemic women failed to lose body fat after 12 weeks of exercise in a walking program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, their HbAlc, total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="25" ids="50112">sex hormone</z:chebi>-binding globulin, and total <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> concentrations decreased (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On pooling the data and including <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> as a categorical grouping variable, stepwise multiple regression analysis indicated that the change in centralized body fat, but not the change in VO2max, was related to change in fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Twelve weeks of walking increased the fitness of diabetic and normoglycemic women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Improvement of fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was related to the loss of centralized body fat rather than to improved fitness </plain></SENT>
