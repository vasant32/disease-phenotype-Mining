<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Serum was obtained from 256 newly diagnosed patients (122 males and 134 females, median age 9.6 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Stimulated C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and A1C were determined in addition to circulating concentration of cytokines at 1, 6, and 12 months after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analyses were adjusted for sex, age, and BMI percentile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Anti-inflammatory IL-1ra was positively associated with C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> after 6 (P = 0.0009) and 12 (P = 0.009) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The beneficial association of IL-1ra on beta-cell function was complemented by the negative association of IL-1 beta with C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> after 1 month (P = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, anti-inflammatory adiponectin was elevated in patients with poor metabolic control after 6 and 12 months (P &lt; 0.05) and positively correlated with A1C after 1 month (P = 0.0004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Proinflammatory IL-6 was elevated in patients with good metabolic control after 1 month (P = 0.009) and showed a positive association with blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal after 12 months (P = 0.047) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: IL-1ra is associated with preserved beta-cell capacity in type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This novel finding indicates that administration of IL-1ra, successfully improving beta-cell function in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, may also be a new therapeutic approach in type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The relation of adiponectin and IL-6 with remission and metabolic status transfers observations from in vitro and animal models into the human situation in vivo </plain></SENT>
