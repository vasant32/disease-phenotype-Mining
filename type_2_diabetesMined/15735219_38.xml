<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Randomized controlled trials and cohort studies examining the effect of oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi>, antiobesity agents, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive agents</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi>, fibrates, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> on the incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were identified from MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Registry, and searches of reference lists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two reviewers independently assessed studies for inclusion and performed data extraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ten studies of oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi> and 15 studies of nonoral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi> were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi> and orlistat are the only drugs that have been studied in randomized controlled trials with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence as the primary end point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the largest studies of 2.5-4.0 years' duration, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (relative risk [RR] 0.69, 95% CI 0.57-0.83), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> (0.75, 0.63-0.90), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> (0.45, 0.25-0.83), and orlistat (hazard ratio [HR] 0.63, 95% CI 0.46-0.86) have <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> been shown to decrease <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence compared with placebo; however, follow-up rates varied from 43 to 96% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Current evidence for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi>, fibrates, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive agents</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> is inconclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the critical question of whether drugs are preventing, or simply delaying, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> remains unresolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Currently, no single agent can be definitively recommended for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Future studies should be designed with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence as the primary outcome and should be of sufficient duration to differentiate between genuine <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention as opposed to simple delay or masking of this condition </plain></SENT>
