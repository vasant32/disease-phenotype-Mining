<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Pima Indians from the Gila River Indian Community in Arizona have a high incidence rate of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> attributable to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since 1965, each member of the population at least 5 years of age is invited to participate in a research examination every other year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During the past 43 years, the overall incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the Pima Indians has not changed, but the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among those less than 15 years of age has increased nearly 6-fold, as an increasing prevalence and degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in the youth have shifted the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> to younger ages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rising frequency of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the youth has led, in turn, to the emergence in mid-life of the major complications of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the introduction and widespread use of medicines to control blood pressure, reduce <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, and block the renin-angiotensin system (<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>) have lead to improvements in the average blood pressure and glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels in the diabetic population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These countervailing forces have influenced the course of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in a generally favorable direction in the past few years, as evidenced by the decline in the overall incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1261469" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="ESRD">end-stage kidney disease</z:e> since 1990 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A continued increase in the incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in youth, however, threatens to reverse this trend </plain></SENT>
