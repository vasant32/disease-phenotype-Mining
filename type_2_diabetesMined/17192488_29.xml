<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These agents bind <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> in the intestine and reduce enterohepatic circulation of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi>, leading to accelerated conversion of cholesterol to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A significant improvement in glycemic control was reported in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> whose <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> was treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi>-binding resins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To confirm the effect of such drugs on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism and to investigate the underlying mechanisms, an animal model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was given a high-fat diet with and without colestimide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diet-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>fatty liver</z:hpo> were markedly ameliorated by colestimide without decreasing the food intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>Hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, and insulin response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, as well as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e>, were markedly and significantly ameliorated by the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Gene expression of the liver indicated reduced expression of small heterodimer partner, a pleiotropic regulator of diverse metabolic pathways, as well as genes for both fatty acid synthesis and gluconeogenesis, by treatment with colestimide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study provides a molecular basis for a link between <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism and suggests the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> metabolism pathway as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
