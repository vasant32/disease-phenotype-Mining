<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There is growing evidence in animal and in vitro studies showing that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> (TZDs) improve pancreatic beta cell (beta-cell) function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> on the beta-cell function of patients with Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is an observational, nested case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We identified 28 patients (TZD group), with T2DM, who had had a meal-stimulated C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> level documented before the addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> to a failing double-therapy regimen with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (MET) and sulphonylurea (SU) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As a control group (CTRL), we identified 26 patients, with T2DM, who also had had a meal-stimulated C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> documented before adding MET to a failing SU monotherapy regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We then proceeded to prospectively remeasure their meal-stimulated C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels and compared the changes over time between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both groups were well matched for age, body mass index (BMI), and HgbA1c before and after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> in the TZD group increased significantly during therapy (from 3.2 +/- 0.5 to 4.2 +/- 0.5, p = 0.01), whereas it remained unchanged in the CTRL group (from 4.8 +/- 0.6 to 5.0 +/- 0.5, p = 0.74) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> ratio also increased significantly in the TZD group (from 1.9 +/- 0.3 to 3.1 +/- 0.3, p = 0.0003) whereas it remained unchanged in the CTRL group (from 3.4 +/- 0.7 to 3.4 +/- 0.3, p = 0.97) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> ratio of the TZD group, which was significantly lower at baseline compared with the CTRL group (1.9 +/- 0.3 vs. 3.4 +/- 0.7, p = 0.04), caught up to its level during treatment (3.1 +/- 0.3 vs. 3.4 +/- 0.3, p = 0.48) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">Thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> seem to induce recovery of pancreatic beta cell function, independently of the correction of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> toxicity </plain></SENT>
