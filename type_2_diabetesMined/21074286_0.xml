<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality predicted from the UKPDS model with observed mortality among T2DM subjects in the U.S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: we studied participants with T2DM from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1988-1994 with characteristics comparable to the UKPDS cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 10-year observed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality was compared to the UKPDS model-predicted mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Lifetable method was used to estimate the probability of mortality for 10 years following diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: among 156 subjects with characteristics comparable to the UKPDS cohort, mean age was 49.6 years, age at T2DM diagnosis was 47.1 years, and T2DM duration averaged 2.6 years, with follow-up for 10.4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The UKPDS model-predicted 10-year mortality was 15.7%, similar to the observed mortality of 14.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Corresponding 10-year predicted versus observed mortality was 32.7% versus 32.4% including subjects &gt;age 65, 17.0% versus 19.3% including individuals with pre-existing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>, and 31.1% versus 20.9% including individuals with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration â‰¥ 6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality predicted by the UKPDS model was comparable to observed mortality in U.S </plain></SENT>
