<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the biological half-life of GLP-1 is short in vivo due to degradation by dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) and renal clearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The stabilization of GLP-1 is critical for its utility in drug development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, several GLP-1 mutants containing an N-terminal cyclic conformation were prepared in that the existence of cyclic conformation is predicted to increase the stabilization of GLP-1 in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, the binding capacities of the mutants were determined, the stabilities of the mutants were investigated and the physiological functions of the mutants were compared with those of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> GLP-1 in animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that the mutant (GLP1N8) remarkably raised the half-life in vivo; it also showed better <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance and higher HbA(1c) reduction than GLP-1 and exendin-4 in rodents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the GLP-1 analog (GLP1N8) which contains an N-terminal cyclic structure might be utilized as possible potent anti-diabetic drugs in the treatment of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
