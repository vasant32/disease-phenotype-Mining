<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To determine a cost per case detected for different screening strategies for both Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> alone and in combination with impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Bayesian framework modelling study using data from the ADDITION-Leicester screening study in UK multi-ethnic primary care setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 5794 people aged 40-75 years (77.4% white European; 22.6% south Asian) without previously known <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared 212 screening strategies including blood tests, a computer practice data score and a risk score, as part of a multi-stage process that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> used an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test as the diagnostic test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Simulation models were created using sensitivity estimates for the expected cost per case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The estimated costs per case identified for the 18 most sensitive strategies varied from £457 to £1639 (€526-1886, for £1=€1.15) for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and £148-913 (€170-1050) for both <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The lowest costing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> strategies ranged from £457 to £523 (€526-601) involving a two-stage screening strategy, a non-invasive risk stratifying tool followed by a blood test, producing sensitivities ranging from 67.1 to 82.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Screening a population using a non-invasive risk stratification tool followed by a screening blood test is the most cost-effective method of screening for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001952'>abnormal glucose tolerance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
