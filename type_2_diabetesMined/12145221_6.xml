<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine, for individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp>, the effects of 6 weeks of meals containing plant-based protein (PP) versus meals with predominantly animal-based protein (AP) on renal function and secondarily on glycemia, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels, and blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a randomized crossover trial, we compared 6 weeks of meals containing only PP with meals containing primarily AP (60% animal, 40% plant) in 17 subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> treated with diet and/or oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Protein content was equivalent to the average American diet, and calories provided weight maintenance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nutrients were equivalent between the two diets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Meals were prepared and packaged by a metabolic kitchen staff and were sent home weekly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the beginning and end of each 6-week period, subjects were studied for 36 h on a metabolic unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no significant differences between diets for glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow, albumin excretion rate, total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> area under the curve (AUC), <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin AUC, HbA(1c,) blood pressure, or serum amino acids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For both diets, at the end of the treatment periods as compared with baseline, total cholesterol was significantly lower (PP and AP: from 4.75 to 4.34 mmol/l, P &lt; 0.01), HbA(1c) had significantly improved (PP: from 8.1 to 7.5%, P &lt; 0.01; AP: from 7.9 to 7.4%, P &lt; 0.01), and diastolic blood pressure was significantly lower (PP: from 83 to 80 mmHg, P &lt; 0.02; AP: from 82 to 78, P &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is no clear advantage for the recommendation of diets containing only PP rather than diets containing protein that is primarily animal-based for individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There are, however, potential <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>, glycemic, and blood pressure benefits for following a carefully constructed, weight-maintaining, healthy diet, regardless of protein source </plain></SENT>
