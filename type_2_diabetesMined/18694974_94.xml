<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genome-wide association (GWA) studies identified multiple new genetic variants that associate with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The predictive value of genetic testing for prediction of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the general population is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We investigated 18 polymorphisms from recent GWA studies on type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the Rotterdam Study, a prospective, population-based study among homogeneous Caucasian individuals of 55 years and older (genotyped subjects, n = 6,544; prevalent cases, n = 686; incident cases during follow-up, n = 601; mean follow-up 10.6 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The predictive value of these polymorphisms was examined alone and in addition to clinical characteristics using logistic and Cox regression analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The discriminative accuracy of the prediction models was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 18 polymorphisms, the ADAMTS9, CDKAL1, CDKN2A/B-rs1412829, FTO, IGF2BP2, JAZF1, SLC30A8, TCF7L2, and WFS1 variants were associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk in our population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The AUC was 0.60 (95% CI 0.57-0.63) for prediction based on the genetic polymorphisms; 0.66 (0.63-0.68) for age, sex, and BMI; and 0.68 (0.66-0.71) for the genetic polymorphisms and clinical characteristics combined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We showed that 9 of 18 well-established genetic risk variants were associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a population-based study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Combining genetic variants has low predictive value for future type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at a population-based level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The genetic polymorphisms only marginally improved the prediction of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> beyond clinical characteristics </plain></SENT>
