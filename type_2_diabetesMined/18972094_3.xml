<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As previously shown, reductions in aPKC activation are seen at sub-maximal and maximal insulin stimulation, reductions in PKB activation are best seen at sub-maximal insulin stimulation and aPKC reductions at maximal insulin are partly improved by thiazolidinedione or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, effects of combined thiazolidinedione-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> treatment on aPKC or PKB activation by sub-maximal and maximal insulin are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Type 2 diabetic patients were examined before and 5 to 6 weeks after combined thiazolidinedione-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> therapy for activation of muscle aPKC and PKBbeta and their upstream activators, the insulin receptor (IR) and IRS-1-associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), during euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp studies conducted with sub-maximal (400-500 pmol/l) and maximal (1400 pmol/l) insulin concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Following combined thiazolidinedione-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> therapy, increases in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal and increases in sub-maximal and maximal insulin-induced activities of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four muscle signalling factors, IR, IRS-1-dependent PI3K (IRS-1/PI3K), aPKC and PKBbeta, were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increases in PKBbeta enzyme activity were accompanied by increases in phosphorylation of PKB and its substrate, AS160, which is needed for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transport </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite improved aPKC activity, muscle aPKC levels, which are diminished in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, were not altered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Combined thiazolidinedione-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> treatment markedly improves sub-maximal and maximal insulin signalling to IR, IRS-1/PI3K, aPKC and PKBbeta in type 2 diabetic muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These improvements exceed those previously reported after treatment with either agent alone </plain></SENT>
