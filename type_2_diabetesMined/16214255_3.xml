<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of nateglinide on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> as well as insulin secretory defects in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Insulin secretion ability was evaluated by the hyperglycemic clamp test, and insulin sensitivity was evaluated by the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp test, using an artificial pancreas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The hyperglycemic clamp test showed that a 7-day treatment with nateglinide significantly <z:mp ids='MP_0003058'>increased insulin secretion</z:mp> in response to high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, although nateglinide is known to facilitate insulin secretion, daily urinary C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> excretion was decreased after nateglinide treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp test, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion rate was significantly increased by nateglinide treatment, indicating that nateglinide functions to decrease <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nateglinide ameliorates <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> as well as insulin secretory defects in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
