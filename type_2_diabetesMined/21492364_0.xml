<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a double-blind, randomized, placebo- and active-controlled study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 287 Chinese type 2 diabetic patients with suboptimal glycaemic control (defined as HbA1c ≥6.5 to &lt;10% and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> ≥7 to ≤15 mmol/l) were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hundred and seventy-four eligible patients were randomized into one of the five treatment arms for 12 weeks: placebo, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> 30 mg daily, rivoglitazone of dose 0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 mg daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a full set analysis, we used analysis of covariance to compare the primary endpoint defined as change in HbA1c from baseline to week 12/last observation carried forward in the rivoglitazone group at each dose level with the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Changes in HbA1c were -0.11% in the 0.5-mg group; -0.22% in the 1-mg group and -0.17% in the 1.5-mg rivoglitazone group; -0.06% in the 30-mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> group and 0.61% in the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared to placebo, changes were significant in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> active treatment groups (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increase in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> and decrease in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> were observed in the rivoglitazone 1 and 1.5 mg groups, respectively, compared to placebo from baseline to week 12 (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Drug-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> was reported in eight patients (7.7%) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rivoglitazone groups compared to six patients (16.2%) in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> group and one patient (3.0%) in the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Rivoglitazone is an efficacious, safe and well-tolerated TZD which improved glycaemic control in Chinese type 2 diabetic patients up to 3 months </plain></SENT>
