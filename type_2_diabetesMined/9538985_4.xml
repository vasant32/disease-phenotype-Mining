<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the fractional esterification rate of cholesterol on <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> particles (FERHDL) in adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and assess its correlation with serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> (CHD) risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: FERHDL was measured in 90 adult (57 men, 33 women) patients by an isotopic assay method involving several steps, including preparation of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>- and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-depleted plasma, labeling of the sample with a trace amount of tritiated cholesterol, separation of free and esterified cholesterol fractions by chromatography post incubation, and subsequent counting of radioactivity in the individual fractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Male patients have higher FERHDL values than their female counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> was controlled for in a multivariate regression analysis, the sex factor was not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a significant positive correlation between FERHDL and plasma total cholesterol (r = 0.32), <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (r = 0.82), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B (apo B; r = 0.48), insulin (r = 0.46), BMI (r = 0.31), and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR; r = 0.50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a negative correlation between FERHDL and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (r = -0.76) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> AI (r = -0.60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When both <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> were controlled for, the only significant correlation was between FERHDL and BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Non-insulin-requiring type 2 diabetic patients have FERHDL, which correlated positively with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> and negatively with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The positive correlation of FERHDL with serum insulin, WHR, total cholesterol, and apo B, but not that with BMI, loses its significance when <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> are controlled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The sex difference between men and women in FERHDL also loses its significance when <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> is controlled </plain></SENT>
