<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to investigate this association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 1,000,000 individuals were randomly sampled from the National Health Insurance database, and incident cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005684" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bladder cancer</z:e> during the period from 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2009 were analyzed among 54,928 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and without previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005684" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bladder cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 165 incident case subjects, 10 (0.39%) were ever users and 155 (0.30%) were never users of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (adjusted hazard ratio in full model 1.305 [95% CI 0.661-2.576]) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The association between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005684" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bladder cancer</z:e> was not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, confirmation of this finding is required because of the possible lack of statistical power owing to the small number of events </plain></SENT>
