<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>If SMBG data do not accurately reflect HbA(1c), attempts to modify lifestyle/pharmacotherapy will be ineffective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine how well SMBG correlates with HbA(1c) and fasting serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FSG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Community-based type 2 patients using SMBG provided their highest and lowest pre- and post-prandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> results in the week before detailed assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ability of average pre- and post-prandial SMBG to predict HbA(1c)&gt;7.0% was determined by linear regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of 1286 patients with known SMBG status, 70% reported using SMBG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pre-prandial SMBG data were obtained from 554 participants and post-prandial SMBG data from 418 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean SMBG result and HbA(1c) correlated significantly (pre-prandial r(s)=0.55, post-prandial r(s)=0.47; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Areas under the ROC curve (95% confidence limits) were 0.78 (0.74-0.83) and 0.74 (0.69-0.78) for pre- and post-prandial SMBG (P&lt;0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The optimal cut-point was 6.5 mmol/L for pre-prandial SMBG (sensitivity 79.3%, specificity 64.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean pre-prandial SMBG results correlated with FSG (r(s)=0.64, P&lt;0.001) but were on average 1.4 mmol/L lower, consistent with known whole blood vs. plasma differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Since SMBG values reflect prevailing glycaemia, refinements in their interpretation and application may improve SMBG effectiveness </plain></SENT>
