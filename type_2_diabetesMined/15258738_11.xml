<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> course of events, maternal genes always develop in the same uterus, thus restricting studies aimed at investigating the relative contribution of these factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have developed an embryo transfer paradigm in rats to overcome this difficulty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Euglycaemic female Wistar rats were superovulated and mated with male Wistar rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The following day, fertilised eggs were transferred into pseudo-pregnant female Wistar rats or hyperglycaemic Goto Kakizaki (GK) rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pregnancies were allowed to go to term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Offspring were weighed at 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months of age and an intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test was carried out at 6 months of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Offspring from Wistar into Wistar embryo transfers (n=20) were not significantly hyperglycaemic compared to the non-manipulated Wistar stock colony (n=26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, offspring from Wistar gametes reared in hyperglycaemic GK mothers (n=51) were significantly lighter at 6 weeks of age (156+/-4.1 g vs 180+/-6.1 g [mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>], p&lt;0.01) and significantly more hyperglycaemic at 6 months of age (fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> 6.6+/-0.18 mmol/l vs 4.8+/-0.21 mmol/l, mean blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> during <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test 14.3+/-0.31 mmol/l vs 11.1+/-0.28 mmol/l, p&lt;0.01) than Wistar gametes transferred back into euglycaemic Wistar mothers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When GK rats were superovulated and mated together, transfer of 1-day-old embryos into pseudo-pregnant Wistar dams did not alleviate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> in adult offspring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In GK rats, a euglycaemic intrauterine environment cannot overcome the strong genetic predisposition to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, in Wistar rats with a low genetic risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, exposure to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> in utero significantly increases the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in adult life </plain></SENT>
