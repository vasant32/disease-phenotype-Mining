<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effects of PIO and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi> (GLIC)-based therapy on insulin sensitivity have not previously been directly compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This analysis aimed to compare the effects of 52 weeks of treatment with PIO (30-45 mg/day) and GLIC (80-320 mg/day), both titrated to maximum tolerable doses, as monotherapy or in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (MET), on insulin sensitivity and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> parameters known to be related to insulin sensitivity in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed an analysis of 1,880 patients with inadequately controlled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (HbA1c 7.5-11.0%) who were participants in two parallel-group, double-blind, double-dummy, randomised, multicentre, clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Measures of insulin sensitivity and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The PIO- and GLIC-based regimens produced similar levels of glycaemic control (HbA1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In both trials, insulin sensitivity as assessed using the homeostasis model assessment was improved in patients receiving PIO, but decreased in those receiving GLIC (mean change, baseline to endpoint: PIO 15.5, GLIC -15.6; p&lt;0.001 and PIO+MET 18.9, GLIC+MET -5.3; p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Improvements in the atherogenic index of plasma (mean change: PIO -0.17, GLIC -0.08; p&lt;0.001 and PIO+MET -0.17, GLIC+MET -0.02; p&lt;0.001), <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (mean change, mmol/l: PIO+MET -0.62, GLIC+MET -0.22; p&lt;0.001) and NEFA (mean change, mmol/l: PIO+MET -0.12, GLIC+MET-0.05; p&lt;0.001) were greater in PIO-treated patients than in patients receiving GLIC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The PIO-based regimens resulted in improved insulin sensitivity and more favourable insulin sensitivity-related <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profiles compared with the GLIC-based regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These benefits may be important in the management of cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
