<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28757">Fructose</z:chebi>-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) is a gluconeogenic enzyme that is upregulated in islets or pancreatic beta-cell lines exposed to high fat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, whether specific beta-cell upregulation of FBPase can impair insulin secretory function is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study therefore is to determine whether a specific increase in islet beta-cell FBPase can result in reduced <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-mediated insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: To test this hypothesis, we have generated three transgenic mouse lines overexpressing the human FBPase (huFBPase) gene specifically in pancreatic islet beta-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, to investigate the biochemical mechanism by which elevated FBPase affects insulin secretion, we made two pancreatic beta-cell lines (MIN6) stably overexpressing huFBPase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: FBPase transgenic mice showed <z:mp ids='MP_0003059'>reduced insulin secretion</z:mp> in response to an intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> bolus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with the untransfected parental MIN6, FBPase-overexpressing cells showed a <z:mp ids='MP_0000352'>decreased cell proliferation</z:mp> rate and significantly depressed <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These defects were associated with a decrease in the rate of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization, resulting in reduced cellular ATP levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results suggest that upregulation of FBPase in pancreatic islet beta-cells, as occurs in states of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> oversupply and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, contributes to insulin secretory dysfunction </plain></SENT>
