<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent findings have shown autophagy to be crucial for proper insulin secretion and β-cell viability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transgenic mice lacking autophagy in their β-cells showed decreased β-cell mass and suppressed <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several studies showed that stress can stimulate autophagy in β-cells: the number of autophagosomes is increased in different in vivo models for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, such as db/db mice, mice fed high-fat diet, pdx-1 knockout mice, as well as in in vitro models of glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pharmacological and molecular inhibition of autophagy increases the susceptibility to cell stress, suggesting that autophagy protects against <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-relevant stresses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recent findings, however, question these conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pancreases of diabetics and β-cells exposed to fatty acids show accumulation of abnormal autophagosome <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and suppression of lysosomal gene expression suggesting impairment in autophagic turnover </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this review we attempt to give an overview of the data generated by others and by us in view of the possible role of autophagy in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, a role which depending on the conditions, could be beneficial or detrimental in coping with stress </plain></SENT>
