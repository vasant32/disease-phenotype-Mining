<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Recently, an international expert committee published new revised criteria for diagnosing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>According to the new criteria, the 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) is the same as in the previous World Health Organization criteria, but the cut point for the fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level has been lowered to be equivalent to the 2-h OGTT level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Measurement of the fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level is preferred to the 2-h OGTT <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ability of the new cut point for fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> to discriminate between those at a high and a low risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> was tested in a population-based study RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The population consisted of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the 1,008 subjects (456 men) born in 1935 and living in a Finnish city A screening for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was carried out in the first phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants who were not on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> medication were invited for an OGTT in the second phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> value was measured from the diabetic subjects on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, measurements of serum cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> were made, and fundus photographs were taken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Altogether, 831 subjects (368 men) (82%) participated and constitute the eligible study population for the present analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fundus photographs were available for 790 subjects (347 men) (95%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 28 subjects (3.5%) who had mild retinopathic changes in the fundus photographs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Retinopathic changes were associated with higher fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, but not with any of the other background factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> was 10.2% (95% CI 4.8-18.5) in subjects with a fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> of &gt; or =6.1 mmol/l, while it was 2.6% (1.5-4.0) in those with a lower fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the former group, a majority (seven of nine) of the subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> were previously diagnosed diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Some cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> were found regardless the level of glycemia, and measurement of the 2-h OGTT <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels did not increase information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of this population study give support to the use of fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels in diagnosing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The lower limit of the highest decile of the fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level was 6.1 mmol/l, and it discriminated subjects at a high risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> from those at a low risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Because of the limited number of subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> in this study, the level of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> cannot be estimated accurately </plain></SENT>
