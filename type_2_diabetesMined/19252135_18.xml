<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> voltage-gated channel, KQT-like subfamily, member 1 (KCNQ1) has been found through a genome-wide association study to be a strong candidate for conferring susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in East Asian and European populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to describe the association between polymorphisms at the KCNQ1 locus with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, beta-cell function, and other type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related traits in a sample of Chinese, Malays, and Asian Indians living in Singapore </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We examined the associations between four previously reported KCNQ1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related traits in 3,734 participants from the population-based 1998 Singapore National Health Survey cohort (2,520 Chinese, 693 Malay, and 521 Asian Indians) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo> was calculated from fasting insulin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> using the homeostasis model assessment method, whereas pancreatic beta-cell function was assessed using the corrected insulin response at 120 min (CIR(120)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SNPs rs2237897, rs2237892, and rs2283228 were significantly associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (odds ratio [OR] 1.48, P = 3 x 10(-4); OR 1.38, P = 0.002; OR 1.31, P = 0.012, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Within the Chinese population, the risk alleles for rs2237897, rs2237892, and rs2283228 were significantly associated with higher fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels (P = 0.014, 0.011, and 0.034, respectively) and reduced CIR(120)(P = 0.007, 0.013, and 0.014, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A similar trend was observed among the Malay and Asian Indian minority groups, although this did not reach statistical significance because of limited sample sizes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The increased risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> associated with KCNQ1 is likely to be caused by a reduction in insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further studies will be useful to replicate these findings and to fully delineate the role of KCNQ1 and its related pathways in disease pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
