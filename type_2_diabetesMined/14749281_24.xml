<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The hormone leptin is secreted from white adipocytes, and serum levels of leptin correlate with adipose tissue mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Leptin was first described to act on the satiety center in the hypothalamus through specific receptors (leptin receptor [ObR]) to restrict food intake and enhance energy expenditure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Important peripheral actions of leptin involve inhibition of insulin biosynthesis and secretion in pancreatic beta-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In turn, insulin stimulates leptin secretion from adipose tissue, establishing a hormonal regulatory feedback loop-the so-called "adipo-insular axis." Multiple signal transduction pathways are involved in leptin signaling in pancreatic beta-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have identified the proinsulin gene and protein phosphatase 1 gene as leptin repressed genes and the gene for the suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 protein as a leptin-induced gene in pancreatic beta-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The molecular effects of leptin culminate to restrict insulin secretion and biosynthesis to adapt <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis to the amount of body fat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In most overweight individuals, however, physiological regulation of body weight by leptin seems to be disturbed, representing "leptin resistance." This leptin resistance at the level of the pancreatic beta-cell may contribute to dysregulation of the adipo-insular axis and promote the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> and manifest type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in overweight patients </plain></SENT>
