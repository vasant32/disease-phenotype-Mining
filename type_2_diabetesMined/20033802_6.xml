<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, we identified a unique splicing form of TCF7L2 expressed in pancreatic islets, pancreas and colon and detected by assay 'ex13-13b' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The expression of ex13-13b strongly correlated with proinsulin in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated pancreatic islets, suggesting a potential role for this form in the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to further characterise this unique TCF7L2 splicing form in human tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used a panel of 34 human tissues and 80 human cell lines to measure the expression of assay ex13-13b with use of quantitative RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The highest expression of assay ex13-13b was detected in several areas of the brain (hypothalamus/thalamus, occipital lobe) and in neuronal cell line SHS5Y5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Low expression was confirmed in pancreatic islets, small intestine, pancreas and colon, while no expression was detected in other human tissues and cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expression of assay ex13-13b correlated with the gene for cocaine- and <z:chebi fb="110" ids="2679">amphetamine</z:chebi>-regulated transcript (CART, also known as CARTPT) in a panel of human tissues (n = 12, r = 0.85, p = 0.00046), pancreatic islets (n = 23, r = 0.62, p = 0.0016) and colon (n = 98, r = 0.54, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The significant correlation between expression of a unique splicing form of TCF7L2, named here TCF7L2-NE, and CART, the gene for an anorexigenic neurohormone expressed in the central and peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system, suggests that these transcripts may share neuroendocrine functions important for brain, gut and pancreatic islets </plain></SENT>
