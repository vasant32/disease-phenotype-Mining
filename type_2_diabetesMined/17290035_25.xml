<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: CBF was examined in 26 diabetic (aged 61.6 +/- 6.6 years) and 25 control (aged 60.4 +/- 8.6 years) subjects using continuous arterial spin labeling (CASL) imaging during baseline, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo>, and <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> rebreathing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Regional gray and white matter, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volumes were measured on a T1-weighted inversion recovery fast-gradient echo and a fluid attenuation inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging at 3 Tesla </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The diabetic group had smaller global white (P = 0.006) and gray (P = 0.001) matter and larger CSF (36.3%, P &lt; 0.0001) volumes than the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regional differences were observed for white matter (-13.1%, P = 0.0008) and CSF (36.3%, P &lt; 0.0001) in the frontal region, for CSF (20.9%, P = 0.0002) in the temporal region, and for gray matter (-3.0%, P = 0.04) and CSF (17.6%, P = 0.01) in the parieto-occipital region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Baseline regional CBF (P = 0.006) and <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> reactivity (P = 0.005) were reduced in the diabetic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hypoperfusion in the frontal region was associated with gray matter <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Higher A1C was associated with lower CBF (P &lt; 0.0001) and greater CSF (P = 0.002) within the temporal region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is associated with cortical and subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> involving several brain regions and with diminished regional cerebral perfusion and vasoreactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Uncontrolled <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may further contribute to hypoperfusion and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Diabetic metabolic disturbance and blood flow dysregulation that affects preferentially frontal and temporal regions may have implications for cognition and balance in elderly subjects with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
