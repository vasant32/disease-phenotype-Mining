<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although physical activity is widely reported to reduce the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetes</z:e>, few studies have examined this issue independently of other lifestyle modifications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this review is to conduct a systematic review of controlled trials to determine the independent effect of exercise on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels and risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in people with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetes</z:e> (IGT and/or IFG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A detailed search of MEDLINE (1966-2006) and EMBASE (1980-2006) found 279 potentially relevant studies, eight of which met the inclusion criteria for this review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> eight studies were controlled trials in individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven studies used a multi-component lifestyle intervention that included exercise, diet and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> goals and one used a structured exercise training intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four studies used the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> over the course of the study as an outcome variable and four relied on 2-h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> as an outcome measure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the four studies that measured the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> as an outcome, the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was reduced by approximately 50% (range 42-63%); as these studies reported only small changes in physical activity levels, the reduced risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is likely to be attributable to factors other than physical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the remaining four studies, only one reported significant improvements in 2-h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> even though <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one reported small to moderate increases in maximal oxygen uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the contribution of physical activity independent of dietary or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> changes to the prevention of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in people with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetes</z:e> is equivocal </plain></SENT>
