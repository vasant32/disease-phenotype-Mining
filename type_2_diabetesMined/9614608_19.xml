<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A descriptive prospective 2-year cohort study was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study population consisted of 272 eligible <z:mp ids='MP_0002057'>NIDDM</z:mp> patients of Dutch origin &gt; or = 40 years of age who had a known <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration &gt; or = 3 months and who were treated with diet and/or oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dependent variables in the logistic regression analysis were scores on the Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Symptom Checklist, the Profile of Mood States, and questions regarding general well-being and treatment satisfaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Potential determinants under study were age, sex, known <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration, insulin dose, duration of insulin therapy, comorbidity, baseline and change in metabolic parameters and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A baseline and 2-year questionnaire were available for 157 patients (58%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, 39 of them (24.8%) were treated with insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Initiation of insulin therapy was significantly associated with improved glycemic control (mean HbA1c 8.2 +/- 1.4 [SD] to 7.4 +/- 0.9%, P = 0.001) and <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> (BMI 27.1 +/- 3.9 to 28.6 +/- 4.3 kg/m2, P = 0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> symptom and well-being scores, only feelings of emotional <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> worsened significantly, although modestly (0.4-1.7 on a scale of 0.0-10.0, P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> management with insulin was experienced as more demanding (P = 0.04), treatment satisfaction scores were not adversely influenced (2.5-1.9, P = 0.39) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>High insulin doses were significantly and independently associated with high symptom scores (total score, hypoglycemic score) and with low mood (displeasure score, anger, tension, emotional <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>) and perceived state of health </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Initiation of insulin therapy in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> improves glycemic control effectively, has little influence on physical and psychological well-being dimensions, and does not affect treatment satisfaction </plain></SENT>
