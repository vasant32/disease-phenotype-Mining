<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine whether the HFE gene variants H63D and C282Y are associated with body iron stores and the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we conducted a nested case-control study of 714 incident cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 1,120 matching control subjects in a prospective cohort, the Nurses' Health Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In both healthy control and diabetic case subjects, H63D homozygosity, C282Y, and the compound heterozygotes were associated with significantly higher levels of plasma ferritin and significantly lower ratios of transferrin receptors to ferritin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Such effects were independent of age, BMI, and lifestyle factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall, there were no significant differences in genotypes of H63D and C282Y between the case and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A meta-analysis of 4,245 case and 5,982 control subjects indicated a null association of C282Y with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk, whereas carriers of H63D or the compound heterozygotes had marginally increased risk (odds ratio [OR] 1.11 [95% CI 1.00-1.25] and 1.60 [0.99-2.60], respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, we found a significant interaction between HFE variants and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> iron intake (P for interaction = 0.029) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ORs of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> across increasing quartiles of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> iron were 1.00, 1.21 (0.72-2.01), 1.72 (1.03-2.88), and 1.49 (0.91-2.46) among the participants with either the H63D or C282Y variant, whereas the ORs were 1.00, 0.71 (0.49-1.05), 1.12 (0.76-1.66), and 0.96 (0.65-1.42) among those with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate significant effects of H63D and C282Y on body iron stores and suggest a potential interaction between HFE genotypes and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> iron intake in relation to the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
