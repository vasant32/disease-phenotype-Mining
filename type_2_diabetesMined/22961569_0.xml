<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Certain dietary and physical activity behaviors have been associated with the risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, yet little is known about the prevalence of these behaviors among Latinas (Latino women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to compare the prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related behaviors in Latinas and non-Latinas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using data from the 2009 California Health Interview Survey, we compared self-reported <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related behaviors of Latinas (n = 4,321) to non-Latinas (n = 21,112) after excluding women who were pregnant or had <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For six behaviors, we determined the cut point for the least healthy tertile: walking, doing moderate to vigorous physical activity, and consuming fried potatoes, sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), desserts, and fast food </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used logistic regression to examine the association between Latina ethnicity and being in the least healthy tertile compared with the other two tertiles for each of these behaviors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In multivariate models adjusted for age, income, education, marital status, health status, smoking, and acculturation, Latinas had a higher risk (odds ratio [95% CI]) of being in the least healthy tertile for the consumption of fast food (1.94 [1.63-2.31]), SSBs (1.53 [1.29-1.82]), and fried potatoes (1.32 [1.18-1.67]), and lower risk for desserts (0.82 [0.70-0.95]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Latinas and non-Latinas had similar physical activity levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Dietary differences between Latinas and non-Latinas (particularly in the consumption of fast food and SSBs) may be the focus of interventions to prevent <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Latinas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further research among Latinas is needed to understand and modify these dietary behaviors </plain></SENT>
