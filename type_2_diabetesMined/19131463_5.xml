<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Subclinical <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> represents a risk factor of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and several <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> complications, but data on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011882" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic neuropathies</z:e> are scarce </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we investigated whether circulating concentrations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase proteins, cytokines, and chemokines differ among diabetic patients with or without diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001271'>polyneuropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We measured 10 markers of subclinical <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in 227 type 2 diabetic patients with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001271'>polyneuropathy</z:hpo> who participated in the population-based MONICA/KORA Survey F3 (2004-2005; Augsburg, Germany) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001271'>polyneuropathy</z:hpo> was diagnosed using the Michigan <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Neuropathy</z:e> Screening Instrument (MNSI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After adjustment for multiple confounders, high levels of C-reactive protein and interleukin (IL)-6 were most consistently associated with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001271'>polyneuropathy</z:hpo>, high MNSI score, and specific neuropathic deficits, whereas some inverse associations were seen for IL-18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that subclinical <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> is associated with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001271'>polyneuropathy</z:hpo> and neuropathic impairments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This association appears rather specific because only certain immune mediators and impairments are involved </plain></SENT>
