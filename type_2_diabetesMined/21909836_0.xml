<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to investigate the association between sHSP27, neuropathic signs and nerve function in individuals with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (NGT), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Participants were recruited consecutively from the population-based Västerbotten Intervention Program (NGT, n = 39, IGT, n = 29, and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, n = 51) and were matched for age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>sHSP27 levels were measured and nerve conduction studies were performed (peroneal and sural nerves). z Scores for each nerve conduction measure were calculated and compiled into a composite z score for the leg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Neuropathy</z:e> disability score (NDS) was used to assess neuropathic signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had significantly lower sHSP27 levels (geometric mean sHSP27 206 pg/ml, 95% CI 142, 299) than those with IGT (geometric mean sHSP27 455 pg/ml, 95% CI 319, 650, p &lt; 0.05) and controls (geometric mean sHSP27 361 pg/ml, 95% CI 282, 461, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Participants with few signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> (first tertile, NDS ≤2) had significantly higher sHSP27 levels (geometric mean sHSP27 401 pg/ml, 95% CI 310, 520) than participants with many signs (third tertile, NDS ≥7) (geometric mean sHSP27 192 pg/ml, 95% CI 128, 288, p = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The highest sHSP27 tertile was associated with better nerve function, adjusted for age, sex, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> medication and HbA(1c) (OR 2.51, 95% CI 1.25, 5.05, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: High sHSP27 levels were associated with better nerve function and fewer neuropathic signs in NGT, IGT and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
