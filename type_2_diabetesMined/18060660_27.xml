<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in WFS1 have been reproducibly associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore examined the effects of these variants on <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence and response to interventions in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Prevention Program (DPP), in which a lifestyle intervention or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> treatment was compared with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We genotyped the WFS1 SNPs rs10010131, rs752854 and rs734312 (H611R) in 3,548 DPP participants and performed Cox regression analysis using genotype, intervention and their interactions as predictors of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also evaluated the effect of these SNPs on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and beta cell function at 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although none of the three SNPs was associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence in the overall cohort, white homozygotes for the previously reported protective alleles appeared less likely to develop <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the lifestyle arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Examination of the publicly available <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Genetics Initiative genome-wide association dataset revealed that rs10012946, which is in strong linkage disequilibrium with the three WFS1 SNPs (r(2)=0.88-1.0), was associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (allelic odds ratio 0.85, 95% CI 0.75-0.97, p=0.026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the DPP, we noted a trend towards <z:mp ids='MP_0003058'>increased insulin secretion</z:mp> in carriers of the protective variants, although for most SNPs this was seen as compensatory for the diminished insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The previously reported protective effect of select WFS1 alleles may be magnified by a lifestyle intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These variants appear to confer an improvement in beta cell function </plain></SENT>
