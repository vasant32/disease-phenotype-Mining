<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> is a sight-threatening microvascular complication of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with a complex multifactorial pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A systematic meta-analysis was undertaken to collectively assess genetic studies and determine which previously investigated polymorphisms are associated with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> studies investigating the association of genetic variants with the development of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> were identified in PubMed and ISI Web of Knowledge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Crude odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were calculated for single nucleotide polymorphisms and microsatellite markers previously investigated in at least two published studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty genes and 34 variants have previously been studied in multiple cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15693">aldose</z:chebi> reductase (AKR1B1) gene was found to have the largest number of polymorphisms significantly associated with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The z-2 microsatellite was found to confer risk (OR 2.33 [95% CI 1.49-3.64], P = 2 x 10(-4)) in type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and z+2 to confer protection (0.58 [0.36-0.93], P = 0.02) against diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> regardless of ethnicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The T allele of the AKR1B1 promoter rs759853 variant is also significantly protective against diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> in type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (0.5 [0.35-0.71], P = 1.00 x 10(-4)), regardless of ethnicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These associations were also found in the white population alone (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Polymorphisms in NOS3, VEGF, ITGA2, and ICAM1 are also associated with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> after meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Variations within the AKR1B1 gene are highly significantly associated with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> development irrespective of ethnicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Identification of genetic risk factors in diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> will assist in further understanding of this complex and debilitating <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> complication </plain></SENT>
