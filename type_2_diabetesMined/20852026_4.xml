<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is characterized by diminished pancreatic β-cell mass and function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Insulin signaling within the β-cells has been shown to play a critical role in maintaining the essential function of the β-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Under basal conditions, enhanced insulin-PI3K signaling via deletion of phosphatase with tensin homology (PTEN), a negative regulator of this pathway, leads to increased β-cell mass and function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the effects of prolonged β-cell-specific PTEN deletion in models of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Two models of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were employed: a high-fat diet (HFD) model and a db/db model that harbors a global leptin-signaling defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A Cre-loxP system driven by the rat insulin promoter (RIP) was employed to obtain mice with β-cell-specific PTEN deletion (RIPcre(+) Pten(fl/fl)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PTEN expression in islets was upregulated in both models of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RIPcre(+) Pten(fl/fl) mice were completely protected against <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in both models of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The islets of RIPcre(+) Pten(fl/fl) mice already exhibited increased β-cell mass under basal conditions, and there was no further increase under diabetic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Their β-cell function and islet PI3K signaling remained intact, in contrast to HFD-fed <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and db/db islets that exhibited diminished β-cell function and attenuated PI3K signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These protective effects in β-cells occurred in the absence of compromised response to DNA-damaging stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PTEN exerts a critical negative effect on both β-cell mass and function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus PTEN inhibition in β-cells can be a novel therapeutic intervention to prevent the decline of β-cell mass and function in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
