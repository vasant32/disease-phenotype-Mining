<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesised that this resistance is even worse during conditions that simulate the postprandial state, when anabolism should be maximal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eight overweight and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> men with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> underwent a hyperinsulinaemic-hyperglycaemic (8 mmol/l) clamp, first with plasma amino acids at postabsorptive (Hyper-2) then at postprandial concentrations (Hyper-3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Whole-body protein kinetics were assessed using L-: [1-(13)C]leucine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hyper-2 results were compared with those of diabetic men whose plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was lowered to 5.5 mmol/l and fasting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268457" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aminoacidaemia</z:e> maintained during the hyperinsulinaemic clamp (Hyper-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In Hyper-2 vs Hyper-1 clamps, leucine flux (2.99 ± 0.16 vs 2.62 ± 0.06 μmol kg [fat-free mass (FFM)](-1) min(-1)), rates of synthesis (2.31 ± 0.15 vs 1.98 ± 0.06) and breakdown (2.38 ± 0.16 vs 2.00 ± 0.07) were higher (p &lt; 0.05), but leucine oxidation and net balance did not differ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In Hyper-3 vs Hyper-2 clamps, leucine flux and synthesis and oxidation rates increased markedly as did net balance (0.84 ± 0.09 vs -0.07 ± 0.04 μmol [kg FFM](-1) min(-1), p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In type 2 diabetic men, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> of protein metabolism is of the same magnitude at 8 vs 5.5 mmol/l, but turnover rates are higher with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Contrary to our hypothesis, sustained postprandial-level hyperaminoacidaemia stimulated positive net protein balance comparable with that previously found in lean non-diabetic men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This was sufficient to overcome the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> of protein anabolism </plain></SENT>
