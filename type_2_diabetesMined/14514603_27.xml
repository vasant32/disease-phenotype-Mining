<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>Coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD) occurs earlier in life and is more often fatal in people with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This excess risk seems to be higher than in those with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and is poorly explained by conventional risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The role of glycemic control is controversial and has not been previously addressed in a prospective manner using a reliable marker for subclinical CAD, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001717'>coronary artery calcification</z:hpo> (CAC), measured by electron beam computed tomography (EBCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We measured CAC twice during an interval of 2.7 years in 109 men and women with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (aged 22-50 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Progression of CAC was found in 21 patients, based on change in the square root-transformed volume score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In multiple logistic regression, CAC progression was associated with baseline <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> (odds ratio [OR] 7.11, 95% CI 1.38-36.6, P = 0.02), adjusted for the presence of CAC at baseline (P = 0.01), duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P = 0.02), sex (P = 0.09), and age (P = 0.27) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was also a significant interactive effect of higher insulin dose and higher BMI (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, in this young cohort with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, suboptimal glycemic control (HbA(1c) &gt;7.5%) was a strong risk factor for progression of CAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo> may also play a role </plain></SENT>
