<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim was to examine whether an intensified diet education would result in a better metabolic control and greater reduction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> than conventional treatment for <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with recently diagnosed type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, both groups were re-examined after a second year of observation period to find out the maintenance of the results after intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After basic education, Int. group participated in 12-months diet education, while Conv. group was treated in local health centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the intervention period, only Int. group showed further weight reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only 20% of patients in Int. and 6% of patients in Conv. group had BMI &lt; 27 kg/m2 at the end of the intervention, while 75% of patients in Int. and 52% of patients in Conv. group had achieved a good metabolic control (fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &lt; 6.7 mmol/l; P = 0.005 between groups) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum total cholesterol did not change significantly, but the changes in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B level were significant in Int. group only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The proposed acceptable values for serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> were achieved by 52 to 88% of patients without major differences between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During the second year of observation, weight gained in both groups and a deterioration was seen in metabolic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Despite that a greater proportion of patients in the Int. group still was in good metabolic control (55.3% vs. 31.8%, P = 0.016), furthermore Int. group was receiving less frequently oral drugs for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> than Conv. group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No differences in serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> were observed between the groups after the observation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> showed a persistent improvement in both groups </plain></SENT>
