<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Aortic and carotid arterial distensibility were evaluated by measuring aortic pulse-wave velocity (a-PWV) and carotid stiffness beta using an echo-tracking system in 137 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 260 age-matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: a-PWV and carotid stiffness beta were significantly higher in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than in age-matched control subjects (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both stiffness beta and a-PWV were significantly higher in the patients with the II genotype than in those with the DD genotype (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the control subjects, multiple regression analysis showed that age and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003233'>decreased HDL cholesterol</z:hpo> were independently associated with increased a-PWV (R2 = 0.244, P &lt; 0.0001) and that age, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and BMI were independently associated with increased carotid stiffness beta (R2 = 0.454, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, age, gene dose of the I allele, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure were independently associated with increased a-PWV (R2 = 0.545, P &lt; 0.0001), and age, gene dose of the I allele, and systolic blood pressure were associated with increases in carotid stiffness beta (R2 = 0.314, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that ACE polymorphism is associated with the impairment of aortic and carotid distensibility in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
