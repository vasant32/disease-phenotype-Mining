<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aim of this study is the assessment of parameters associated with increased AF in a sample of type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: AF was determined in a consecutive series of type 2 diabetic 92 patients aged 69.1+/-12.4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate correlations with several clinical and chemical parameters were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significant (p&lt;0.01) correlation of AF was found with age (r=0.33) and HbA1c (r=0.34) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for age and HbA1c, micro- or macrovascular complications of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were associated with higher AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a higher AF was found in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> (2.7+/-1.0 AU versus 2.2+/-0.7 AU; p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Waist circumference, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> showed a significant correlation with AF after adjustment for age and HbA1c (adj. r=0.30, 0.29, and -0.27; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Skin autofluorescence in type 2 diabetic patients is associated not only with degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> and age, but also with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
