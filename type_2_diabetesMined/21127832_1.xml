<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 5,110 unrelated French men and women who participated in the prospective Data from Epidemiological Study on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin Resistance</z:hpo> Syndrome (DESIR) study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Additional cross-sectional analyses were performed on 4,472 French individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 3,065 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped: rs10010131, rs1801213/rs7672995 and rs734312 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We observed statistically significant associations between the major alleles of the three variants and prevalent type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the DESIR cohort at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cox analyses showed an association between the G-allele of rs10010131 and incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (HR 1.34, 95% CI 1.08-1.70, p = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similar results were observed for the G-allele of rs1801213 and the A-allele of rs734312 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The GGA haplotype was associated with an increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> as compared with the ACG haplotype (HR 1.26, 95% CI 1.04-1.42, p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also observed statistically significant associations of the three SNPs with plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, HbA(1c) levels and insulin secretion at baseline and throughout the study in individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or at risk of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, no association was observed in those who remained normoglycaemic at the end of the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Associations between the three variants and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were replicated in cross-sectional studies of type 2 diabetic patients in comparison with a non-diabetic control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The most frequent haplotype at the haplotype block containing the WFS1 gene modulated insulin secretion and was associated with an increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
