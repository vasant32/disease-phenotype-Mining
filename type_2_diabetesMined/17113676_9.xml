<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients previously on &gt;6 months' continuous insulin treatment aged &gt;or=18 years in a randomized, multinational, controlled, open-label, parallel group, 26-week study received twice-daily <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin and either glulisine (0-15 min before breakfast and dinner; n=448) or RHI (30-45 min before breakfast and dinner; n=442) at least twice daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean baseline characteristics were similar between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in baseline to endpoint HbA(1c) reductions (glulisine: -0.32%; RHI: -0.35%; p=0.5726), and the non-inferiority of glulisine versus RHI was demonstrated (difference in adjusted mean change 0.03%; 95% CI: -0.07, 0.13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Postprandially, glulisine lowered plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> significantly more versus RHI at 2h (14.14 mmol/L versus 15.28 mmol/L; p=0.0025) and excursions at 1h (3.99 versus 4.59; p=0.0151) and 2h (4.87 versus 6.03; p=0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No between-group differences occurred in the frequencies and monthly rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e>; nocturnal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> from Month 4 to treatment end was less frequent with glulisine versus RHI (9.1% versus 14.5%; p=0.029) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Glulisine was non-inferior to RHI in reducing HbA(1c) in T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Glulisine demonstrated superior postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control and was associated with fewer nocturnal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0745153" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemic episodes</z:e>, indicating clinical benefits </plain></SENT>
