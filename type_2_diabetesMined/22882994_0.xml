<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Pharmacogenetic studies revealed that variants in genes related to the pharmacokinetics of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> were associated with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate possible associations of the variants in genes encoding organic cationic transporters-solute carrier family 22, members A1, A2 (SLC22A1, SLC22A2) and solute carrier family 47, member A1 (SLC47A1) with response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hundred forty-eight drug-naive patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genotyping for SLC22A1 rs622342, SLC22A2 rs316019 and SLC47A1 rs2289669 variants was performed using real-time PCR with subsequent melting-curve analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SLC47A1 rs2289669 genotype was significantly associated with the reduction in <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA1c) after 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty percentage of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> that are homozygous for A-allele of SLC47A1 had twofold reduction in HbA1c in comparison with the patients carrying G-allele (GG + GA: 0.55 ± 0.09% vs. AA: 1.10 ± 0.18%, p = 0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the results of this study might have in future practical implication in personalised treatment of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
