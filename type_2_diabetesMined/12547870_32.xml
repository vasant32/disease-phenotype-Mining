<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to validate a counseling strategy that could be used by physicians in their daily outpatient practice to promote the adoption and maintenance of physical activity by type 2 diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The long-term (2-year) efficacy of the behavioral approach (n = 182) was compared with usual care treatment (n = 158) in two matched, randomized groups of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who had been referred to our Outpatient <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The outcome of the intervention was consistent patient achievement of an energy expenditure of &gt;10 metabolic equivalents (METs)-h/week through voluntary physical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 2 years, 69% of the patients in the intervention group (27.1 +/- 2.0 METs x h/week) and 18% of the control group (4.1 +/- 0.8 METs x h/week) achieved the target (P &lt; 0.001) with significant (P &lt; 0.001) improvements in BMI (intervention group 28.9 +/- 0.2 versus control group 30.4 +/- 0.3 kg/m(2)) and HbA(1c) (intervention group 7.0 +/- 0.1 versus control group 7.6 +/- 0.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This randomized, controlled study shows that physicians can motivate most patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> to exercise long-term and emphasizes the value of individual behavioral approaches in daily practice </plain></SENT>
