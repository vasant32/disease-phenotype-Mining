<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The FABP2 Ala54Thr polymorphism has been associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in several populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of FABP2 genotypes in 223 Chilean subjects (136 women and 87 men aged 65-79 years) and its association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a 4 years follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi>, Insulin and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> were measured in fasting plasma samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo> was estimated through the homeostasis model assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> was diagnosed according <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Ala54Thr allelic variant was determined by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment-length polymorphism analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression techniques were used to assess gene-disease associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Genotype frequencies were estimated as 30.5, 49.3 and 20.2% for the Ala/Ala, Ala/Thr and Thr/Thr, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The crude OR for the association between Thr54 carriers and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was estimated as 2.18 (1.12-4.24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The corresponding OR for the association between Thr54 carriers with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Metabolic Syndrome</z:e> was 1.06 (0.59-1.88) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After adjustment by BMI and age, a significant association persists for Thr54Thr carriers and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (OR 2.70; 95% CI 1.113-6.527) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The 4-year cumulative incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was higher in Thr carriers than in non-carriers (20.1% versus 8.5%; p&lt;0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The adjusted association between Thr54Thr polymorphism and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence was OR 3.84 (95% CI: 1.140-12.910) CONCLUSION: Our results strongly suggest an association between the Ala54Thr polymorphism of FABP2 with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, revealing a genetic dosage effect regarding its association with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Chilean elders </plain></SENT>
