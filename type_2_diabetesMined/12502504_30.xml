<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In humans, a negative correlation between insulin sensitivity and intramyocellular <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> (IMCL) content has been shown; thus, IMCL becomes a marker for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) has been established as a dependable method for selective detection and quantification of IMCL in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To validate the interrelation between insulin sensitivity and IMCL in an animal model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we established volume selective (1)H-MRS at 7 Tesla to noninvasively assess IMCL in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In male <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> Diabetic Fatty rats and their lean littermates, IMCL levels were determined repeatedly over 4 months, and insulin sensitivity was measured by the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp method at 6-7 and at 22-24 weeks of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A distinct relation between IMCL and insulin sensitivity was demonstrated as well as age dependence for both parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">Rosiglitazone</z:chebi> treatment caused a clear reduction of IMCL and hepatic fat despite <z:hpo ids='HP_0004324'>increased body weight</z:hpo>, and a marked improvement of insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, the insulin sensitizing properties of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> were consistent with a redistribution of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> from nonadipocytic (skeletal muscle, liver) back into fat tissue </plain></SENT>
