<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Studies in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519106" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">rodent models</z:e> have suggested that reduction in renal transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 may underlie the renoprotective effects of the renin-angiotensin system (<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>) blockade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the role of the <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> blockade in abrogating TGF-beta in human disease is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, we sought to examine TGF-beta gene expression and biological activity in human renal biopsies, before and after ACE inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was extracted from renal biopsies taken from participants in the Diabiopsies study, a randomized controlled 2-year trial of 4 mg/day <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8024">perindopril</z:chebi> versus placebo that reported a reduction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> and cortical matrix expansion in type 2 diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Biopsies taken at study entry and at 2 years were obtained in 12 patients (6 placebo and 6 taking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8024">perindopril</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TGF-beta1 and its receptor <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were quantified by real-time PCR, and its biological activity was assessed by examining the activation of its intracellular signaling pathway (phosphorylated Smad2) and the expression TGF-beta-inducible gene H3 (betaig-H3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, TGF-beta1 expression was similar in both placebo- and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8024">perindopril</z:chebi>-treated groups and was unchanged over a 2-year period in biopsies of placebo-treated subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8024">perindopril</z:chebi> treatment led to a substantial diminution in TGF-beta1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> (mean 83% reduction, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylated Smad2 immunolabeling and betaig-H3 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were similarly reduced with ACE inhibition (P &lt; 0.05) but unchanged in the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No differences were noted in the gene expression of TGF-beta receptor II in biopsies of either placebo- or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8024">perindopril</z:chebi>-treated subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that over a 2-year period, treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8024">perindopril</z:chebi> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> leads to a reduction in both renal TGF-beta1 gene expression and its downstream activation </plain></SENT>
