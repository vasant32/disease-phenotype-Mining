<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The results were based on cross-sectional data from 64,498 men and women (aged &gt;or=20 years) who were in the Nord-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Tr</z:e>Ã¸ndelag Health Study, which included 128 cases of LADA, 1,134 cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and 123 cases of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, prospective data on 46,210 subjects, which included 80 incident cases of LADA, observed between 1984 and 1986 and 1995 and 1997 were available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with LADA had antibodies against GAD and were insulin independent at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: FHD was associated with a four times (odds ratio [OR] 3.92 [95% CI 2.76-5.58]) increased prevalence of LADA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Corresponding estimates for type 2 and type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were 4.2 (3.72-4.75) and 2.78 (1.89-4.10), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with LADA who had FHD had lower levels of C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (541 vs. 715 pmol/l) and were more often treated with insulin (47 vs. 31%) than patients without FHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prospective data indicated that subjects with siblings who had <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had a 2.5 (1.39-4.51) times increased risk of developing LADA during the 11-year follow-up compared with those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that FHD is a strong risk factor for LADA and that the influence of family history may be mediated through a heritable reduction of insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
