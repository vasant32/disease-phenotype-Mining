<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We searched electronic databases and selected studies that evaluated the effect of supervised exercise intervention on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> in adult people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used random effect models to derive weighted mean differences of exercise on <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profiles and blood pressure control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-two RCTs (2808 subjects) met inclusion criteria and are included in our meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Structured exercise was associated with a change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) of -2.42 mmHg (95% CI, -4.39 to -0.45 mmHg), diastolic blood pressure (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi>) of -2.23 mmHg (95% CI, -3.21 to -1.25 mmHg), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>) of 0.04 mmol/L (95% CI, 0.02-0.07 mmol/L), and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>) of -0.16 mmol/L (95% CI, -0.30 to -0.01 mmol/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>Heterogeneity</z:hpo> was partially explained by age, dietary co-intervention and the duration and intensity of the exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Supervised exercise is effective in improving blood pressure control, lowering <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>, and elevating <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> levels in people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Physicians should recommend exercise for their adult patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who can safely do so </plain></SENT>
