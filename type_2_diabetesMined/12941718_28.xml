<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate which anthropometric measurements of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> best predict type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a population of Pima Indians and whether additional information on <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk could be obtained by combining measures of general <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> with measures of body fat distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of 624 men and 990 nonpregnant women &gt;18 years of age without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects were followed a mean of 5.25 years for the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (using 1997 American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association criteria) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 322 new cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (107 men and 215 women) were diagnosed during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Baseline <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> measurements were highly correlated and predicted <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in proportional hazards models adjusted for age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BMI had the highest hazard ratio in men and women, with age-adjusted hazard ratios per SD of 1.73 (95% CI 1.44-2.07) and 1.67 (1.45-1.91), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>According to receiver-operating characteristic analysis, BMI and waist-to-height ratio were the best predictors of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in men, while in women BMI, waist-to-height ratio, waist circumference, and waist-to-thigh ratio were the best predictors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The predictive abilities of models containing BMI were not significantly improved by including other measures of general <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> or measures of the body fat distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Throughout its range, BMI was an excellent predictor of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk in Pima Indians and was not significantly improved by combining it with other measures of general <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> or body fat distribution </plain></SENT>
