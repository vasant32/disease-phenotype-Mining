<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There is little clinical evidence when AST-120 should be prescribed for subjects with early stage overt diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore designed a prospective, randomized, controlled study for subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> &lt;1.5mg/dl and urinary protein &gt;0.5g/day) in November, 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was defined as exceeding 2mg/dl of serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, and the secondary end point was defined as introducing a hemodialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two subjects were selected, and after excluding 6 drop-out subjects, 16 subjects (10 in the control group; 6 in the KRM group) finally entered the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up periods were 37 and 34 months in the control and KRM groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in clinical characteristics including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo> at baseline between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a significant reduction in urinary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17840">indoxyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> at month 12 in the KRM group than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significant difference was observed in changes in mean levels of serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> versus time between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The primary end points were counted in 7 (70%) of the control subjects, while only 1 (17%) of the KRM group, and the Kaplan-Meier analysis was statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although 4 (40%) of the control group and 1 (17%) of the KRM group were initiated hemodialysis as the secondary end point, the difference did not reach a statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, we concluded that administration of AST-120 initiated in early stage overt diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> stunts the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
