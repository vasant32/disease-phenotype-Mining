<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Previous observational studies have found an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001735'>acute pancreatitis</z:hpo> among type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, limited information is available on this association and specifically on the role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim, therefore, was to further assess the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001735'>acute pancreatitis</z:hpo> in adult patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed a population-based case-control analysis nested in a cohort of 85,525 type 2 diabetic patients and 200,000 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-free individuals from the general population using data from The Health Improvement Network database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects were followed up to ascertain incident cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001735'>acute pancreatitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 419 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001735'>acute pancreatitis</z:hpo>, 243 in the general population and 176 in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Incidence rates were 30.1 and 54.0 per 100,000 person-years in the general population and the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> cohort, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the cohort analysis, the adjusted incidence rate ratio of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001735'>acute pancreatitis</z:hpo> in diabetic patients versus that in the general population was 1.77 (95% CI 1.46-2.15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of this association decreased with adjustment for multiple factors in the nested case-control analysis (adjusted odds ratio 1.37 [95% CI 0.99-1.89]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we found that the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001735'>acute pancreatitis</z:hpo> was decreased among insulin-treated diabetic patients (0.35 [0.20-0.61]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may be associated with a slight increase in the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001735'>acute pancreatitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We also found that insulin use in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> might decrease this risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further research is warranted to confirm these associations </plain></SENT>
