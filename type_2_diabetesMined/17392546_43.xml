<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare associations of markers of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk between men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Following a case-cohort design, cases of incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were identified from 7,936 subjects aged 35-74 years at baseline who participated in the population-based Monitoring of Trends and Determinants in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">Cardiovascular Disease</z:e> (MONICA)/Cooperative Research in the Region of Augsburg (KORA) studies conducted between 1984 and 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin (IL)-6 were measured in 527 cases of incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (305 men and 222 women) and 1,698 noncases (889 men and 809 women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After adjustment for age and survey and lifestyle factors including smoking, alcohol intake, and physical activity, elevated concentrations of CRP showed a considerably stronger association with risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in women (hazard ratio comparing tertile extremes 7.60 [95% CI 4.43-13.04]) than in men (1.84 [1.27-2.67]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The P value for the sex interaction was &lt;0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further adjustment for metabolic risk factors considerably attenuated these associations, and they became nonsignificant in men but remained significant in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IL-6 was also more strongly associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in women, but there was no significant sex interaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that inflammatory processes may be of particular importance in the pathogenesis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in women </plain></SENT>
