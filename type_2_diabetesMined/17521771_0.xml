<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the association between beer and other type of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> consumption and tHcy levels among type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Male type 2 diabetic patients without overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> were studied (n=242) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">Ethanol</z:chebi> consumptions of the patients were 35.1+/-37.8mL/day for total <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi>, 13.9+/-15.2mL/day for beer <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> and 21.2+/-32.1mL/day for non-beer <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both, total and non-beer <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> consumption correlated with tHcy, whereas beer <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> consumption showed a trend to inverse association with tHcy (standard regression coefficient, 0.184, 0.283 and -0.110, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each intake of 30mL/day <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> consumption was associated with an increase of tHcy of 0.6micromol/L for total <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> and 1.1micromol/L for non-beer <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> and a decrease of tHcy of 0.7micromol/L for beer <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similar trend was observed in the analysis model which included only drinkers, and also in an adjusted analysis model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma tHcy of beer only drinkers was lower than that of non-beer alcohol only drinkers (8.9+/-1.9micromol/L versus 11.5+/-5.5micromol/L, P=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Non-beer <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> consumption might be less healthy compared with beer <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> consumption among type 2 diabetic patients in terms of the effects on tHcy </plain></SENT>
