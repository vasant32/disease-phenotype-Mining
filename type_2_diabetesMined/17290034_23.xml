<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We set forth to determine incidence and identify predictors (including microvascular complications and treatment) of first <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> (CHD) event in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>-free type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A cohort of 6,032 women and 5,612 men, sampled from a nationwide network of hospital-based <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> clinics, was followed up for 4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Baseline assessment included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, and foot <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>First CHD events (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, coronary artery bypass grafting, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, and electrocardiogram-proven <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp>) were analyzed for 29,069 person-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The age-standardized incidence rate (per 1,000 person-years) of first CHD event (n = 881) was 28.8 (95% CI 5.4-32.2) in men and 23.3 (20.2-26.4) in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Major CHD (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, coronary artery bypass grafting, and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty) was less frequent in women (5.8 [4.3-7.2]) than in men (13.1 [10.9-15.4]; a sex ratio of 0.5 [0.4-0.6]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Incidence rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> outcomes were higher in patients with microvascular complications (for major CHD, age-adjusted rate ratios were 1.6 [1.2-2.21] in men and 1.5 [1.0-2.2] in women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By multivariate Cox analysis, age and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration were risk predictors common in both sexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In men, glycemic control and treated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> were additional independent risk factors, but residing in the south was associated with a significant 29% risk reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In women, higher <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>/lower <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> and microvascular complications were independent risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>-free patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, risk of first CHD event depends on sex, geographic location, and presence of microvascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>Hyperglycemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, particularly in men, and diabetic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e>, especially in women, are risk factors amenable to more aggressive treatment </plain></SENT>
