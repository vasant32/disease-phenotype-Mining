<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 2035 patients were enrolled of whom 1954 were classified as having Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study was open with no control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Physicians had sole control of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> doses prescribed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, 2-h postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, HbA(1) or HbA(1c) and other clinical parameters, such as <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and liver enzyme levels, were also assessed as measures of efficacy and safety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One-third of the patients received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> as monotherapy and two-thirds in combination with other <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The concomitant diseases were also assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> were low in the majority of the patients and well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi>-associated side effects was 4.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No sustained adverse changes in laboratory measures occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Over the 5 years, HbA(1) and glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA(1c)) decreased by 2.4 and 1.8% points, respectively, and the mean fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and 2-h postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> decreased by 2.7 and 3.4 mmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mean body weight was reduced by 0.9 kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that when used in long-term day-to-day management of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> is well tolerated and can improve glycaemic control as monotherapy, as well as in combination therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In a high-risk patient group <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> proved to be a safe drug </plain></SENT>
