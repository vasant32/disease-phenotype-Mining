<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first phase consists of a brief spike lasting approximately 10 min followed by the second phase, which reaches a plateau at 2-3 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is widely thought that diminution of first-phase insulin release is the earliest detectable defect of beta-cell function in individuals destined to develop type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and that this defect largely represents beta-cell exhaustion after years of compensation for antecedent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this article, the origins of these concepts are reviewed and recent evidence is presented suggesting that reductions in both phases of insulin release are equally early, that they precede <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> other than that simply due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and that they therefore may represent the primary genetic risk factor predisposing individuals to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
