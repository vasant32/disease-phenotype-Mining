<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether alterations in meal absorption and gastric emptying contribute to the mechanism by which inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) lower postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We simultaneously measured gastric emptying, meal appearance, endogenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production, and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disappearance in 14 subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treated with either vildaglipitin (50 mg b.i.d.) or placebo for 10 days using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fasting (7.3 +/- 0.5 vs. 7.9 +/- 0.5 mmol/l) and peak postprandial (14.1 +/- 0.6 vs. 15.9 +/- 0.9 mmol/l) <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations were lower (P &lt; 0.01) after vildagliptin treatment than placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite lower <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations, postprandial insulin and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> concentrations did not differ during the two treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the integrated (area under the curve) postprandial glucagon concentrations were lower (20.9 +/- 1.6 vs. 23.7 +/- 1.3 mg/ml per 5 h, P &lt; 0.05), and glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> 1 (GLP-1) concentrations were higher (1,878 +/- 270 vs. 1,277 +/- 312 pmol/l per 5 h, P = 0.001) during vildagliptin administration compared with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Gastric emptying and meal appearance did not differ between treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Vildagliptin does not alter gastric emptying or the rate of entry of ingested <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> into the systemic circulation in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DPP-4 inhibitors do not lower postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations by altering the rate of nutrient absorption or delivery to systemic circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Alterations in islet function, secondary to increased circulating concentrations of active GLP-1, are associated with the decreased postprandial glycemic excursion observed in the presence of vildagliptin </plain></SENT>
