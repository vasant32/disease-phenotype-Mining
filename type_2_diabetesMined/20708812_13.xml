<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since the launch of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> in 2006, a compelling body of evidence has accumulated showing that dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, which augment endogenous GLP-1 and GIP levels, represent an important advance in the management of T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Currently, three DPP-4 inhibitors - <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi>, vildagliptin and saxagliptin - have been approved in various countries worldwide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several other DPP-4 inhibitors, including linagliptin and alogliptin, are currently in clinical development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As understanding of, and experience with, the growing number of DPP-4 inhibitors broadens, increasing evidence suggests that the class may offer advantages over other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs in particular patient populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expanding evidence base also suggests that certain differences between DPP-4 inhibitors may prove to be clinically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This therapeutic diversity should help clinicians tailor treatment to the individual patient, thereby increasing the proportion that safely attain target HbA(1c) levels, and reducing morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This review offers an overview of DPP-4 inhibitors in T2DM and suggests some characteristics that may provide clinically relevant differentiators within this class </plain></SENT>
