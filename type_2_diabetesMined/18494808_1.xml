<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Antilipolytic agents that reduce FFA concentrations may be potentially useful in the treatment of 2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our previous observation that CVT-3619 lowered plasma FFA and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> concentrations in rats and enhanced insulin sensitivity in rodents with dietary-induced forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> suggested that it might be of use in the treatment of patients with 2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study was undertaken to compare the antilipolytic effects of CVT-3619 in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (Sprague Dawley, SD) and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ZDF rats had significantly higher fat pad weight, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin and FFA concentrations than those of SD rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EC(50) values for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42471">forskolin</z:chebi>-stimulated FFA release from isolated adipocytes from SD and ZDF rats were 750 and 53 nM, respectively (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Maximal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42471">forskolin</z:chebi> stimulation of FFA release was significantly (p &lt; 0.01) less in ZDF rats (133 +/- 60 microM) compared with SD rats (332 +/- 38 microM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>EC(50) values for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> to increase lipolysis in adipocytes from SD and ZDF rats were 2 and 7 nM respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Maximal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi>-stimulated lipolysis was significantly (p &lt; 0.01) lower in adipocytes from ZDF rats (179 +/- 23 microM) compared with SD rats (343 +/- 27 microM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Insulin inhibited lipolysis in adipocytes from SD rats with an IC(50) value of 30 pM, whereas adipocytes from ZDF rats were resistant to the antilipolytic actions of insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, IC(50) values for CVT-3619 to inhibit the release of FFA from SD and ZDF adipocytes were essentially the same (63 and 123 nM respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CVT-3619 inhibited lipolysis more than insulin in both SD (86 vs. 46%, p &lt; 0.001) and ZDF (80 vs. 13%, p &lt; 0.001) adipocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In in vivo experiments, CVT-3619 (5 mg/kg, PO) lowered FFA to a similar extent in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Plasma concentrations of CVT-3619 were not different in SD and ZDF rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> expression of the A(1) receptors relative to beta-actin expression in adipocytes from SD (0.98 +/- 0.2) and ZDF rats (0.99 +/- 0.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The antilipolytic effects of CVT-3619 appear to be independent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and animal model </plain></SENT>
