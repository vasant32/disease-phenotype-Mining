<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in humans is associated with hypercoaguability; however, little is known about platelet function in mouse models of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> used to study this disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine platelet aggregation, coagulation, and markers of platelet activation in a diet-induced mouse model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four week old, male, C57BL/6J mice were randomized to a standard chow or high fat (60% beef lard) diet for 4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To examine platelet function we measured <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-induced whole blood aggregometry, whole blood coagulation by thromboelastography, tail <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> times, platelet microparticle and platelet expression of p-selectin and platelet expression of CD61 by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Diabetic mice exhibited less aggregation (p&lt;0.05), less coagulation (p&lt;0.01), prolonged tail <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> times (n.s.), and lower <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> stimulated platelet CD61 expression (p&lt;0.001) compared to non-diabetic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in platelet microparticle and platelet p-selectin expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Diet-induced type 2 diabetic mouse do not demonstrate the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo> and platelet activation typically observed in humans with this disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>More studies are warranted to further explore platelet function in this mouse model; to determine their applicability for studying these alterations in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
