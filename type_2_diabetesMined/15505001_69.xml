<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Despite the popularity of coronary stenting in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD), restenosis remains a challenging clinical problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated the efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> for preventing in-stent restenosis in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective, randomized, case-controlled trial involving 95 diabetic patients with CAD who were randomly assigned to either the control or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> group (48 and 47 patients, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) was performed at study entry and again at 6-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was the restenosis rate, which was determined by QCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighty-three patients (45 patients with 55 lesions in the control group and 38 patients with 51 lesions in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> group) completed follow-up angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">Rosiglitazone</z:chebi> treatment for 6 months reduced fasting insulin concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The high-sensitivity C-reactive protein concentration was significantly reduced in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> group compared with that in the control group (from 2.92 +/- 1.98 to 0.62 +/- 0.44 mg/l, P &lt; 0.001 vs. from 2.01 +/- 1.33 to 1.79 +/- 1.22 mg/l, P = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the baseline and follow-up <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> concentrations were not different between two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The rate of in-stent restenosis was significantly reduced in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> group compared with the control group (for stent lesions: 17.6 vs. 38.2%, P = 0.030) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> group had a significantly lower degree of diameter stenosis (23.0 +/- 23.4% vs. 40.9 +/- 31.9%, P = 0.004) compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> significantly reduces in-stent restenosis in diabetic patients with CAD who underwent coronary stent implantation </plain></SENT>
