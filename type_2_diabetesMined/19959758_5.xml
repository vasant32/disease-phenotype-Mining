<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Although patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> suffer from increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> and a higher incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> due to impaired immune function, details on <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-induced decrease in immunity are lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed how immune-mediating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are affected in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: From 33 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 28 healthy volunteers, we obtained PBMCs and investigated their susceptibility to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and functional alteration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In a subpopulation of PBMCs, monocytes derived from patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were more susceptible to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> than monocytes from healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Monocytes from patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had decreased phagocytotic activity and were less responsive to Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands, although the expression of TLRs did not differ significantly between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, monocytes from patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had a distinctly different gene expression profile compared with monocytes from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers as assessed with DNA microarray analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Specifically, quantitative real-time detection PCR measurements showed an elevated expression of the markers of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in diabetic monocytes, and electron microscopic examination of monocytes revealed morphologic alterations in the ER of cells derived from patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Consistently, the ER stress inducer tunicamycin <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> of otherwise healthy monocytes and attenuated the proinflammatory responses to TLR ligands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that monocytes comprise a substantially impaired subpopulation of PBMCs in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and that ER stress is involved in these pathologic changes mechanistically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This implies that the affected monocytes should be investigated further to better understand diabetic immunity </plain></SENT>
