<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: After a 4-week run-in period on their habitual diets, 76 patients were randomly assigned to have conventional diet or conventional diet with agar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both groups were on these diets for 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Body weight, body mass index (BMI), glycaemic control, blood pressure, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, total body fat, fat distribution and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> were assessed before and after the experimental period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In both groups, after 12 weeks, mean body weight, BMI, fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, homeostasis model assessment-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, and systolic and diastolic blood pressures had decreased significantly from their baseline values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HbA(1)c, visceral fat area, subcutaneous fat area, total body fat, insulin area under the curve after oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test and total cholesterol decreased significantly in the agar-diet group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 12 weeks, mean changes of body weight (-2.8 +/- 2.7 kg vs. -1.3 +/- 2.3 kg, p = 0.008), BMI values (-1.1 +/- 1.1 kg/m(2) vs. -0.5 +/- 0.9 kg/m(2), p = 0.009) and total cholesterol (-7.6 +/- 27.5 mg/dl vs. + 2.4 +/- 23.4 mg/dl, p = 0.036) were significantly greater in the agar-diet group than in the conventional diet group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The agar diet resulted in marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> due to the maintenance of reduced calorie intake and to an improvement in metabolic parameters </plain></SENT>
