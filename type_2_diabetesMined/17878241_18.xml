<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined whether AdipoR1 and/or AdipoR2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in human adipose tissue is fat-depot specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also studied whether their expression in visceral and subcutaneous fat depots is associated with metabolic parameters and whether their expression is regulated by intensive physical exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We determined metabolic parameters and assessed AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression using quantitative real-time PCR in adipose tissue in an observational study of 153 subjects and an interventional study of 60 subjects (20 each with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo>, and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) before and after intensive physical training for 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression is not significantly different between omental and subcutaneous fat, but their expression is several-fold lower in adipose tissue than in muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AdipoR2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in visceral fat is highly correlated with its expression in subcutaneous fat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AdipoR2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in both visceral and subcutaneous fat is positively associated with circulating adiponectin and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> levels but negatively associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> as well as parameters of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, glycemia, and other <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels before and after adjustment for fat mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Physical training for 4 weeks resulted in increased AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in subcutaneous fat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: AdipoR2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in fat is negatively associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and metabolic parameters independently of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and may mediate the improvement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in response to exercise </plain></SENT>
