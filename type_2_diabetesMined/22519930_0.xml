<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The source, non-interventional, longitudinal, long-term study involves 314 centres in 12 countries in five regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>People were enrolled having started any insulin regimen in the previous 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To identify factors associated with the choice of insulin regimen, multivariable backward logistic regression was performed on eligible physician and participant explanatory variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Participants (N = 3031) had mean age 62 years, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration 11 years, body mass index 29.3 kg/mÂ² and an HbA1c of 9.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Participants in Japan had less <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, smoked more and used fewer concomitant medications than those of other regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only physician location (rural or urban) influenced the choice of insulin in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the other four-regions-combined, physician location, specialty, sex and practice type influenced choice of insulin as did participant location, baseline HbA1c, use of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering therapies and prior insulin secretagogue use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Choice of initial insulin regimen was influenced by several physician and participant characteristics in Canada and Europe, but only by physician location in Japan </plain></SENT>
