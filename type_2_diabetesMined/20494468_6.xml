<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">Cardiovascular disease</z:e> is significantly more common in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than in non-diabetics, and accounts for more than two-thirds of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> associated with the condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Many physicians believe that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> is responsible, at least in part, for this additional risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The benefit of improved glycaemic control on microvascular complications is well established and recent trials have attempted to clarify the role of glycaemic control on macrovascular outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This article reviews the recent evidence from a post-interventional analysis of the UKPDS and the ACCORD, ADVANCE, VADT and HEART2D trials for an association between elevated blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels and vascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that improved glycaemic control has the potential to significantly reduce the risk of micro- and macrovascular disease when instigated early in the disease course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, in more advanced <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the benefits of improved control appear to be less evident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have also suggested that controlling postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> may be an important component in the reduction of vascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these studies indicate that glycaemic control remains a key cornerstone in the management of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
