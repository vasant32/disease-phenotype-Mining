<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have examined the direct actions of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5001">fenofibrate</z:chebi> on human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and have specifically investigated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycan</z:chebi> synthesis and binding to <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">Proteoglycans</z:chebi> synthesised by human VSMCs treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5001">fenofibrate</z:chebi> (30 micromol/l) were assessed for binding to human <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> using a gel mobility shift assay, metabolically labelled with [(35)S]-<z:chebi fb="100" ids="16189">sulphate</z:chebi> and quantitated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32915">cetylpyridinium chloride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were then assessed for electrophoretic mobility by <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-PAGE, for size by gel filtration, for sulphation pattern by fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis, and for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18085">glycosaminoglycan</z:chebi> (GAG) composition by enzyme digestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">Proteoglycans</z:chebi> synthesised in the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5001">fenofibrate</z:chebi> showed an increase in the half-maximum saturation concentration of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> from 36.8+/-12.4 microg/ml to 77.7+/-17 microg/ml under basal conditions, from 24.9+/-4.6 microg/ml to 39.1+/-6.1 microg/ml in the presence of TGF-beta1, and from 9.5+/-4.4 microg/ml to 31.1+/-3.4 microg/ml in the presence of platelet-derived growth factor/insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="5001">Fenofibrate</z:chebi> treatment in the presence of TGF-beta1 inhibited the incorporation of [(35)S]-<z:chebi fb="100" ids="16189">sulphate</z:chebi> into secreted and cell-associated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycans</z:chebi> synthesised by human VSMCs by 59.2% (p&lt;0.01) and 39.8% (p&lt;0.01) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The changes in <z:chebi fb="100" ids="16189">sulphate</z:chebi> incorporation following treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5001">fenofibrate</z:chebi> were associated with a concentration-related increase in the electrophoretic mobility due to a reduction in GAG length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no change in the sulphation pattern; however, there was an alteration in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36233">disaccharide</z:chebi> composition of the GAGs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5001">Fenofibrate</z:chebi> modifies the structure of vascular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycans</z:chebi> by reducing the length of the GAG chains and GAG composition, resulting in reduced binding to human <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>, a mechanism which may lead to a reduction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> in people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5001">fenofibrate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
