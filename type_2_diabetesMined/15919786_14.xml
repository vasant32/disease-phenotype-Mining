<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transgenic mice with adipocyte-specific overexpression of FOXC2 (forkhead transcription factor) have been generated and shown to be protected against diet-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To understand the underlying mechanism, we examined the effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> high-fat feeding on tissue-specific insulin action and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in the FOXC2 transgenic (Tg) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Whole-body fat mass were significantly reduced in the FOXC2 Tg mice fed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> diet or high-fat diet compared with the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diet-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in skeletal muscle of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice was associated with defects in insulin signaling and significant increases in intramuscular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37554">fatty acyl CoA</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, FOXC2 Tg mice were completely protected from diet-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and intramuscular accumulation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37554">fatty acyl CoA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>High-fat feeding also blunted insulin-mediated suppression of hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice, whereas FOXC2 Tg mice were protected from diet-induced hepatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate an important role of adipocyte-expressed FOXC2 on whole-body <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism and further suggest FOXC2 as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
