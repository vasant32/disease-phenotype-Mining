<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe the mortality of a population with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with the local nondiabetic population, using age-, sex-, and cause-specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rates and relative and absolute differences in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A population-based cohort of 4,842 people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> living within South Tees, U.K., was identified and followed from 1 January 1994 to 31 December 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were obtained from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> certificates, and mortality rates were compared with the nondiabetic population of the same area for the same time period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 1,205 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (24.9%) in the study population during the 6 years of study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, mortality from cardiovascular causes was significantly increased in both sexes and at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Relative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rates for the age band 40-59 years were 5.47 (95% CI 4.18-7.15) for men and 5.60 (3.44-9.14) for women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rates declined with age for both sexes, but absolute excess mortality increased with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no consistent differences in noncardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rates, other than for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similar outcomes were found for type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, although these results were limited by a much smaller population size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>People with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal impairment</z:e> had significantly higher mortality than people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> alone, with a rate ratio of 7.27 for people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> aged 40-59 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In an area of the U.K. with high cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rates, people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had significantly higher cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rates than people without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Interventions targeted at <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> should be used to try and reduce this excess premature mortality, which is especially high in those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal impairment</z:e> </plain></SENT>
