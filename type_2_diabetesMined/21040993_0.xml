<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to test the reliability and validity of the Japanese version of the Appraisal of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Scale (ADS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: the study enrolled 346 Japanese patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>: 200 men and 146 women who were 63.2 ± 10.1 and 62.2 ± 11.9 years of age and had HbA1c levels of 6.9 ± 1.2% and 7.3 ± 1.9%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: the questionnaire was divided into three components: "Psychological impact of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>", "Sense of self-control", and "Efforts for symptom management" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cronbach's alpha was 0.746-0.628 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significant correlations were observed between "Sense of self-control" and self-managed dietary and exercise behaviors and HbA1c levels; between "Psychological impact of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>" and various treatments, symptoms causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, and HbA1c levels; and between "Efforts for symptom management" and dietary and nutritional behaviors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The questionnaire showed better evidence of internal consistency, test-retest reliability and validity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: our results suggested that the Japanese version of ADS may be a useful tool for the quick assessment of common <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxieties</z:hpo> and motivation toward treatment in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
