<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients having normoalbuminuria (urinary albumin excretion &lt;30 mg/g <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, n = 179) or <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> (albumin excretion 30-299 mg/g <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, n = 94) at baseline have been followed up for 8 years: ratio of men to women was 160/113, the mean age was 58 years, pretreatment HbA(1c) (A1C) was 8.8%, and blood pressure was 136/76 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A1C &lt;6.5% and blood pressure &lt;130/80 mmHg were targeted, and the A1C of 6.5 +/- 0.7% (mean +/- SD) and blood pressure of 127 +/- 11/72 +/- 6 mmHg have been maintained during the 8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> or macroalbuminuria (albumin excretion &gt; or =300 mg/g <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>) in initially normoalbuminuric patients and progression to macroalbuminuria or regression to normoalbuminuria in initially microalbuminuric patients were assessed at year 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Development occurred in 27 (15%) of the normoalbuminuric patients and progression and regression in 16 (17%) and 20 (21%), respectively, of the microalbuminuric patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significant independent relationships existed between development and higher achieved mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) and regression and lower achieved mean SBP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the patients with achieved mean SBP &lt;120 mmHg, development was 3%, progression was 11%, and regression was 44% during 8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prediction for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> by blood pressure and glycemia alone was limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, albumin excretion at year 8 was positively correlated with achieved mean SBP and baseline <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Development and progression were low and regression was high with SBP of 120 mmHg, provided A1C was maintained at 6.5% </plain></SENT>
