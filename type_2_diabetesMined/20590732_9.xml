<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity account for endothelial cell damage, endothelial repair is also affected by <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are involved in the maintenance of endothelial homoeostasis and in the process of new vessel formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For these reasons, EPCs are thought to have a protective impact within the cardiovascular system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, EPCs appear to modulate the functioning of other organs, providing neurotropic signals and promoting repair of the glomerular endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The exact mechanisms by which EPCs provide cardiovascular protection are unknown and the definition of EPCs is not standardized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Notwithstanding these limitations, the literature consistently indicates that EPCs are altered in type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and in virtually <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, experimental models suggest that EPC-based therapies might help prevent or reverse the features of end-organ complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This identifies EPCs as having a novel pathogenic role in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and being a potential therapeutic target </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Several ways of favourably modulating EPCs have been identified, including lifestyle intervention, commonly used medications and cell-based approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Herein, we provide a comprehensive overview of EPC pathophysiology and the potential for EPC modulation in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
