<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined expression of the following: (1) Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1), which regulates cholesterol absorption; (2) ATP-binding cassette transporters G5 and G8 (ABCG5, ABCG8), which regulate cholesterol homeostasis through their ability to excrete enterocyte cholesterol back into the lumen of the intestine; and (3) microsomal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> transfer protein (MTTP), which packages the chylomicron particle by assembling cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B48 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS, MATERIALS AND METHODS: Type 2 diabetic (26) and non-diabetic (21) patients were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Levels of NPC1L1, ABCG5 and ABCG8 and MTTP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were measured in duodenal biopsies by real-time PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">Lipoproteins</z:chebi> were isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Diabetic patients had more NPC1L1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> than the control subjects (p&lt;0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expression of ABCG5 and ABCG8 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was lower in the diabetic patients (p&lt;0.05) and MTTP expression was increased (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a positive correlation between NPLC1L1 and MTTP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> (p&lt;0.01) and a negative correlation between NPC1L1 and ABCG5 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Diabetic patients on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> therapy had increased ABCG5 and ABCG8 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> compared to those not on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> (p&lt;0.02 and p&lt;0.05) and less MTTP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> than those not on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: This study demonstrates that in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> there are important alterations to the expression of intestinal genes that regulate cholesterol absorption and chylomicron synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In diabetic patients <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> therapy is associated with reduced MTTP expression and increased ABCG5 and ABCG8 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The study suggests new mechanisms to explain postprandial diabetic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidaemia</z:e> and the beneficial effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
