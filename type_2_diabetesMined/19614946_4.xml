<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In an open, randomized, parallel-group, comparative, controlled trial, 387 patients were randomized and treated with glulisine + OAD (n = 130), glulisine monotherapy (n = 127) or OAD only (n = 130) for 16 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Glulisine was self-injected subcutaneously three times daily (0-15 minutes before meals) at a starting dose of &gt;or=0.2 U/kg/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients titrated the glulisine dose to achieve a 2-h postprandial plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (2h-<z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi>) level of 7.1-9.5 mmol/l (128-172 mg/dl) by administering at least one additional unit at each appropriate meal time if the 2h-<z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi> level was &gt; 9.5 and &lt; 11.1 mmol/l (&gt; 172 and &lt; 200 mg/dl) and by administering at least two additional units if the 2h-<z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi> level was &gt;or= 11.1 mmol/l (&gt;or= 200 mg/dl) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therapy with OAD was continued at the stable baseline regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary efficacy endpoint was change in <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c) (HbA(1c)) from baseline to endpoint in the intention-to-treat population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, therapy with OAD was a sulphonylurea only and a sulphonylurea + a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3095">biguanide</z:chebi> in approximately 24 and 76% of patients respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both glulisine groups had larger reductions in adjusted mean HbA(1c) than the OAD-only group (glulisine + OAD, -2.07%; glulisine monotherapy, -1.25%; OAD only, -0.61%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Superiority of glulisine + OAD and glulisine monotherapy vs. OAD only was shown by differences in adjusted mean HbA(1c) change from baseline values of -1.46% (p &lt; 0.0001) and -0.64% (p &lt; 0.0001) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both glulisine groups had better 2h-<z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi> control than the OAD-only group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean daily glulisine doses increased from baseline to endpoint (glulisine + OAD, 13.3-22.5 U; glulisine monotherapy, 14.2-38.0 U) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> events per patient-year in the entire treatment phase was 11.9 in the glulisine + OAD group, 8.8 in the glulisine monotherapy group and 1.7 in the OAD-only group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was only one event of severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e>, which occurred in the glulisine + OAD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Efficacy and safety were similar in Japanese and Korean subpopulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Both glulisine + OAD and glulisine monotherapy were well tolerated and effective for Japanese and Korean patients with T2DM mellitus inadequately controlled by OAD therapy alone </plain></SENT>
