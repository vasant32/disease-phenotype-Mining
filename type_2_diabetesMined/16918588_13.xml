<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several studies have demonstrated that type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM) can be prevented/delayed in subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) by using pharmacologic agents and/or lifestyle interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, a number of challenges remain, including the translation of lifestyle programmes to the general population and the need to achieve greater risk reductions by using pharmacologic approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IGT, like DM, is characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta-cell dysfunction</z:hpo> and increased hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We believe that the use of combination <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> therapy would be a particularly effective <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this context, we initiated the Canadian Normoglycemia Outcomes Evaluation (CANOE) study, a moderately sized, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary objective of CANOE is to determine whether treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>, in addition to a healthy living lifestyle programme, will prevent the development of DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The secondary objective of CANOE is to determine whether this treatment approach will improve <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> associated with IGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 200 patients will be recruited in Toronto and London, Ontario, and followed for an average of 4 years (range 3-5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Active treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (500 mg) plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> (2 mg), administered as one capsule twice daily, will be compared to matched placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Subjects will be eligible for randomization if they have IGT and are between the ages of 30-75 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome will be the development of new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> DM, diagnosed by either two fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> values of &gt;or=7 mmol/l or one positive oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test with a 2-h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> value of &gt;11.0 mmol/l during the active drug phase of the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>With a sample size of 100 participants per group, we will be able to detect a relative risk reduction of 45%, with a two-sided log-rank test with a significance level of 0.05 and 80% power, assuming that the median time to progression is 8 years in the control group and that participants will be recruited over 2 years and followed for an average of 4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the CANOE study will determine whether combination pharmacological therapy combined with a lifestyle intervention programme can significantly modify the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in high-risk Canadians </plain></SENT>
