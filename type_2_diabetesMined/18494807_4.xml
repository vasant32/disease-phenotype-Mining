<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is a common disorder with high risk of macrovascular and microvascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These complications are largely driven by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidaemia</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, for which aggressive treatment is thus warranted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Achieving and maintaining control of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three risk factors is especially difficult, however, and new therapeutic approaches could be useful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">Bile acids</z:chebi> have a well-established and important role in cholesterol homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Normally, their levels are maintained primarily by ileal reabsorption and enterohepatic recycling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">Bile acid</z:chebi> sequestrants bind <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> in the intestine, reduce this recycling and deplete the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> pool, thereby stimulating use of hepatic cholesterol for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> synthesis, which leads to accelerated removal of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> from the plasma and a decrease in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, recent evidence suggests that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> sequestrants can lower <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels to a clinically meaningful degree </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This review presents this evidence and the possible mechanisms by which these <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering effects occur and discusses the apparently unique ability of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> sequestrants among <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering agents to significantly improve two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There is renewed interest in the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> sequestrants in individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, most of whom would benefit from additional reductions in both <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> and glycaemia </plain></SENT>
