<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Offspring of mothers with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> are far more likely to develop type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that maternal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance in pregnancy affects fetal insulin sensitivity or beta-cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a prospective singleton pregnancy cohort study, we analyzed <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, and proinsulin concentrations in maternal blood at the 50-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) at 24-28 weeks of gestation and in venous cord blood (n = 248) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cord blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-to-insulin ratio and proinsulin concentration were used as indicators of fetal insulin sensitivity and the proinsulin-to-insulin ratio was used as an indicator of fetal beta-cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Higher OGTT blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were associated with significantly lower cord plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-to-insulin ratios (r = -0.31, P &lt; 0.001) and higher proinsulin concentrations (r = 0.31, P &lt; 0.001) but not with proinsulin-to-insulin ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a comparison of gestational diabetic (n = 26) versus euglycemic pregnancy, cord blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-to-insulin ratios were substantially lower (geometric mean 10.1 vs. 20.0 mg/dl/microU/ml; P &lt; 0.001), whereas proinsulin concentrations were much higher (24.4 vs. 13.8 pmol/l; P &lt; 0.001), despite similar cord blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations indicating adequate management of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The differences remained significant after controlling for prepregnancy and fetal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e>, family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, gestational age, and other potential confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant changes in the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-to-insulin ratio and proinsulin concentration were also observed in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (n = 31) mothers, but the differences became not statistically significant after adjustment for maternal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance and fetal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Maternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> may impair fetal insulin sensitivity (but not beta-cell function) and consequently "program" the susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
