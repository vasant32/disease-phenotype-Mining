<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE Whether dietary habits early in life can affect risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2DM) in adulthood is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the relationship between dietary patterns during adolescence and risk of T2DM in midlife </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We examined the 7-year incidence of T2DM in relation to dietary patterns during high school among 37,038 participants in the Nurses' Health Study II cohort, who completed a food-frequency questionnaire about their diet during high school </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dietary patterns were derived by factor analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate relative risk (RR) and 95% CI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS The prudent pattern, characterized by healthy foods, was not associated with risk of T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Western pattern, characterized by desserts, processed meats, and refined grains, was associated with 29% greater risk of T2DM (RR 1.29; 95% CI 1.00-1.66; P trend 0.04), after adjusting for high school and adult risk factors comparing extreme quintiles, but was attenuated after adjusting for adult weight change (1.19; 0.92-1.54) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Women who had high Western pattern scores in high school and adulthood had an elevated risk of T2DM compared with women who had consistent low scores (1.82; 1.35-2.45), and this association was partly mediated by adult BMI (1.15; 0.85-1.56) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS A Western dietary pattern during adolescence may increase risk of T2DM in later life, partly through adult <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Preventive measures should be aimed at developing healthy dietary habits that begin in early life and continue through adulthood </plain></SENT>
