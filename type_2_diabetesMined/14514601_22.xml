<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the Pro12Ala polymorphism in the PPARgamma gene was associated with risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the Nurses' Health Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study was a nested case-control study of 387 incident cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 771 matching control subjects nested within the Nurses' Health Study, a prospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Association between PPARgamma genotype and incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was estimated using logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Carriers of the PPARgamma variant 12Ala allele had reduced risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with noncarriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were 0.74 (95% CI 0.55-1.00) and 0.72 (0.52-0.99), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study provide further support for an inverse association between the PPARgamma variant 12Ala allele and risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
