<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Men with type 1 or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and a minimum 3-month history of ED were randomly allocated to one of three groups: placebo (n = 71), tadalafil 10 mg (n = 73), or tadalafil 20 mg (n = 72) taken up to once daily for 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Changes from baseline in mean scores on the erectile function domain of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) and changes from baseline in the proportion of "yes" responses to question 2, "Were you able to penetrate?," and 3, "Were you able to complete intercourse?," of the Sexual Encounter Profile were coprimary outcome measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 191 (88%) of 216 patients completed the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment with tadalafil significantly improved <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> primary efficacy variables, regardless of baseline HbA(1c) level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therapy with tadalafil also significantly improved a number of secondary outcome measures, including changes in other IIEF domains, individual IIEF questions, and percentage of positive responses to a global assessment question measuring erection improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment with tadalafil did not alter mean HbA(1c) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Tadalafil was well tolerated, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyspepsia</z:e> being the most frequent adverse events with active treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Tadalafil therapy significantly enhanced erectile function and was well tolerated by men with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and ED </plain></SENT>
