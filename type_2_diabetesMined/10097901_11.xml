<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in recent times there have been major changes in classification and understanding of these types, including improved knowledge of maturity-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the young, with the identification of mutations relating to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948379" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">impaired insulin secretion</z:e> and the recognition of slow-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in adults now designated as latent autoimmune <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in adults (LADA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A major problem area in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> classification concerns cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003677'>slowly progressive</z:hpo> forms of type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, particularly in adults aged 25-50 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This is a more contemporary problem because cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are presenting at an increasingly younger age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the landmark U.K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prospective <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, islet cell antibodies (ICAs) and antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (anti-GAD) were measured at diagnosis in 3,672 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall proportion with ICAs was 6%, and anti-GADs was 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These subjects clearly had type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or LADA by both phenotypic and genotypic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of auto antibodies correlated particularly with a younger age and phenotypic features consistent with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (e.g., early age at diagnosis, lower BMI, and reduced beta-cell function) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall, of patients requiring insulin by 6 years, 38% were anti-GAD+ at baseline compared with 5.3% of those not on insulin at 6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Antibodies to GAD indicate an underlying autoimmune process and have a high positive predictive value for type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and future insulin dependency in adults </plain></SENT>
