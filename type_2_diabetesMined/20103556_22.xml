<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data were obtained through an Internet survey of 502 U.S. adults self-identified as taking insulin by injection to treat type 1 or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multiple regression analysis assessed independent associations of various demographic, disease, and injection-specific factors with insulin omission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Intentional insulin omission was reported by more than half of respondents; regular omission was reported by 20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant independent risk factors for insulin omission were younger age, lower income and higher education, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, not following a healthy diet, taking more daily injections, interference of injections with daily activities, and injection pain and embarrassment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Risk factors differed between type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients, with diet nonadherence more prominent in type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and age, education, income, pain, and embarrassment more prominent in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Whereas most patients did not report regular intentional omission of insulin injections, a substantial number did </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that it is important to identify patients who intentionally omit insulin and be aware of the potential risk factors identified here </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For patients who report injection-related problems (interference with daily activities, injection pain, and embarrassment), providers should consider recommending strategies and tools for addressing these problems to increase adherence to prescribed insulin regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This could improve clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
