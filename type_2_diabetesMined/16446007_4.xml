<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND SETTING: Randomised, double-blind, clinical trial, conducted in the Unit of Medical Angiology of the University of Catania </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND INTERVENTIONS: Seventy-four patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002057'>NIDDM</z:mp>-associated PAD were treated with PLC (2 g/day) or placebo for 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Ankle/brachial index (ABI) and the distance of pain-free walking were evaluated at baseline, 6 and 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Malondialdehyde, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32585">4-hydroxynonenal</z:chebi>, oxidation time of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoproteins</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi>/nitrate ratio were measured as indices of the overall oxidation profiles at baseline and 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the PLC group, ABI progressively increased (0.78, 0.83, and 0.88 at 0, 6 and 12 months, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The distance of pain-free walking also improved (366.4, 441.9 and 519.8 m, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the placebo group, these parameters were relatively unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significant improvements in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> parameters of the oxidative profile were seen in the PLC-treated group, with only minor variations observed in the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that adjunct therapy with PLC may be warranted in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-associated PAD </plain></SENT>
