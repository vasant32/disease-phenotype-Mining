<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the functional roles of LXR in the liver, intestine, fat, and macrophages are well established, its role in pancreatic beta-cells has not been clearly defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we revealed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> activation of LXR contributes to lipotoxicity-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta-cell dysfunction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We observed significantly elevated expression of LXR in the islets of diabetic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519106" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">rodent models</z:e>, including fa/fa ZDF rats, OLETF rats, and db/db mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In primary pancreatic islets and INS-1 insulinoma cells, activation of LXR with a synthetic ligand, T0901317, stimulated expression of the lipogenic genes ADD1/SREBP1c, FAS, and ACC and resulted in increased intracellular <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> accumulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> LXR activation induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in pancreatic islets and INS-1 cells, which was synergistically promoted by high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Taken together, we suggest <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> accumulation caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> activation of LXR in beta-cells as a possible cause of beta-cell lipotoxicity, a key step in the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
