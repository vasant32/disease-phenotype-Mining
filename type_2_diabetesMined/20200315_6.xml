<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Common variants in the <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> receptor type 1B (MTNR1B) locus have been shown to increase fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) and the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to evaluate whether nonsynonymous variants in MTNR1B associate with monogenic forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, or related metabolic traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: MTNR1B was sequenced in 47 probands with clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0004904'>maturity-onset diabetes of the young</z:hpo> (MODY), in 51 probands with early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> familial type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and in 94 control individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six nonsynonymous variants (G24E, L60R, V124I, R138C, R231H, and K243R) were genotyped in up to 22,142 Europeans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Constitutive and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi>-induced signaling was characterized for the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> receptor type 1B (MT2) and the 24E, 60R, and 124I MT2 mutants in transfected COS-7 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No mutations in MTNR1B were MODY specific, and none of the investigated MTNR1B variants associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The common 24E variant associated with increased prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (odds ratio 1.20 [1.08-1.34]; P = 8.3 x 10(-4)) and <z:mp ids='MP_0006087'>increased BMI</z:mp> (beta = 0.5 kg/m(2); P = 1.2 x 10(-5)) and waist circumference (beta = 1.2 cm; P = 9 x 10(-6)) in combined Danish and French study samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>24E also associated with decreased FPG (beta = -0.08 mmol/l; P = 9.2 x 10(-4)) in the Danish Inter99 population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Slightly decreased constitutive activity was observed for the MT2 24E mutant, while the 124I and 60R mutants displayed considerably decreased or completely disrupted signaling, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Nonsynonymous mutations in MTNR1B are not a common cause of MODY or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among Danes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MTNR1B 24E associates with increased body mass and decreased FPG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Decreased MT2 signaling does apparently not directly associate with FPG or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
