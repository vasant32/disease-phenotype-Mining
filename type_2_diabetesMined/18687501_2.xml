<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data from PRESENT were analysed according to predefined subgroups stratified by age, body mass index (BMI) and ethnic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Achieved HbA1c levels were similar in each of: four age subgroups (&lt;40 years 7.82%, 40-50 years 7.70%, 50-60 years 7.75%, &gt;or=65 years 7.75%); five BMI subgroups (&lt;25 kg/m(2): 7.78%, 25-30 kg/m(2): 7.58%, 30-35 kg/m(2): 7.57%, 35-40 kg/m(2): 7.74%, &gt;or=40 kg/m(2): 7.93%); and Asian/Pacific Islander, Middle Eastern/Asian, White ethnic-origin subgroups (7.78%, 7.40%, 7.59%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Black ethnic-origin subgroup had a higher baseline HbA1c of 11.61% (other groups 9.29-9.63%) and achieved a final HbA1c of 8.59% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> was reported by fewer than 1% of subjects in any subgroup at end of study; overall end of study <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> rates were less than four events/subject year (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subgroups) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, data from subgroups in the PRESENT study indicate that BIAsp 30 can be initiated and titrated effectively to help patients of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ages, of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> degrees of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and from a variety of ethnic origins, to achieve clinically relevant improvements in glycaemic control with low rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
