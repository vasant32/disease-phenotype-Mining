<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate whether mutations in hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-4gamma, a transcription factor homologous to HNF-4alpha, contribute to the etiology of early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Linkage between <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and two polymorphic markers at the HNF-4gamma locus (D8S286 and D8S548) was evaluated in 32 multigenerational families with early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal-dominant</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> unlinked to known <z:hpo ids='HP_0004904'>maturity-onset diabetes of the young</z:hpo> genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Total logarithm of odds (LOD) scores were strongly negative (-50.3 at D8S286 and -46.2 at D8S548), but linkage could not be excluded in 15 families having LOD scores &gt;-2.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To screen these pedigrees for HNF-4gamma mutations, the gene structure was defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction experiments indicated that the first 1,674 bp of the published cDNA sequence (3,248 bp) were a cloning artifact, the correct cDNA sequence was determined by 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and primer extension assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on the new cDNA sequence (1,731 bp), 11 exons were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After screening the 5' flanking region and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> coding exons for mutations, we identified several polymorphisms, one of which affected the amino acid sequence (M190I) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, no mutations segregating with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> could be found in these families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that genetic variability in the HNF-4gamma gene is unlikely to play a major role in the etiology of early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal-dominant</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
