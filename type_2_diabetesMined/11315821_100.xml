<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the safety and efficacy of the long-acting analog insulin glargine compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were previously treated with insulin alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 518 subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were receiving <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin with or without regular insulin for postprandial control were randomized to receive insulin glargine (HOE 901) once daily (n = 259) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin once or twice daily in = 259) for 28 weeks in an open-label, multicenter trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Doses were adjusted to obtain target fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &lt;6.7 mmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At study end point, the median total daily insulin dose in both treatment groups was 0.75 IU/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The treatment groups showed similar improvements in HbA1c from baseline to end point on intent-to-treat analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean change (means +/- SD) in HbA1c from baseline to end point was similar in the insulin glargine group (-0.41 +/- 0.1%) and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> group (-0.59 +/- 0.1%) after patients began with an average baseline HbA1c of approximately 8.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The treatments were associated with similar reductions in fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, mild symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> was similar in insulin glargine subjects (61.4%) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin subjects (66.%) However, nocturnal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> in the insulin glargine group was reduced by 25% during the treatment period after the dose-titration phase(26.5 vs. 35.5%, P = 0.0136) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subjects in the insulin glargine group experienced less <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> than those in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> group (0.4 vs. 1.4 kg, P &lt; 0.0007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, once-daily bedtime insulin glargine is as effective as once- or twice-daily <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> in improving and maintaining glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, insulin glargine deonstrates a lower risk of nocturnal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> and less <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin </plain></SENT>
