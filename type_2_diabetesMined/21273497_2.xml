<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients (n = 1,209) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were recruited from five university-affiliated primary care clinics for an observational study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Vietnamese American (133, 59.4%) and Mexican American (351, 50.2%) patients were more likely to report symptoms consistent with clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (Center for Epidemiological Studies <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e>-D] scale score â‰¥ 22) than non-Hispanic whites (119, 41.6%; F [2, 1206] = 8.05, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite comparable <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care, Vietnamese and Mexican patients with high depressive symptoms were less likely to be diagnosed and treated than non-Hispanic whites (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P values &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Minority patients who reported low levels of trust in their provider were less likely to have been diagnosed or treated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (adjusted odds ratio 0.65, 95% CI 0.44-0.98, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
