<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated in vitro and in vivo the pharmacological profiles of a new PTP1B inhibitor, JTT-551: monosodium ({[5-(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30355">1,1-dimethylethyl</z:chebi>)thiazol-2-yl]<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>} {[(4-{4-[4-(1-propylbutyl)phenoxy]<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>}<z:chebi fb="1" ids="30396">phenyl</z:chebi>)thiazol-2-yl]<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>}amino)<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: PTP1B inhibitory activity and the inhibition mode were assayed with p-nitrophenyl phosphate as a substrate, and the selectivity of JTT-551 against other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52242">PTPs</z:chebi>, including T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TCPTP), CD45 protein tyrosine phosphatase (CD45) and leucocyte common antigen-related protein tyrosine phosphatase (LAR), was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> uptake with JTT-551 treatment was evaluated in L6 rat skeletal myoblasts (L6 cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the in vivo study, we investigated the effects on insulin receptor (IR) phosphorylation and blood chemical parameters with JTT-551 administration in ob/ob mice and db/db mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: JTT-551 showed an inhibitory effect on PTP1B with a Ki value of 0.22 microM, and a mixed-type inhibition mode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ki values of TCPTP, CD45 and LAR were 9.3, 30 or higher and 30 or higher microM, respectively, and JTT-551 exhibited clear selectivity against the other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52242">PTPs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, JTT-551 increased the insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake in L6 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A single administration of JTT-551 in ob/ob mice enhanced the IR phosphorylation of liver and reduced the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In db/db mice, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> administration showed a hypoglycaemic effect without an acceleration of body <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: JTT-551, a newly developed PTP1B inhibitor, improves <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism by enhancement of insulin signalling and could be useful in the treatment of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
