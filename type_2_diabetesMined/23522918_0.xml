<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serum osteocalcin (BGP), serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="29022">BAP</z:chebi>), 24-h urinary <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18095">hydroxyproline</z:chebi> (HOP), blood and urine calcium (Ca), phosphate (P) levels and bone mineral density (BMD) were assessed and compared in 30 patients with T2DM (group D), 25 T2DM patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> (group DN) and 27 nondiabetic control subjects (group C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with the nondiabetic controls, patients in both groups D and DN had decreased serum osteocalcin (BGP) and bone mineral density (BMD) while serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and urinary <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18095">hydroxyproline</z:chebi> (HOP) were increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Decrease in BGP was not correlated with ALP (r=-0.1, P&lt;0.37) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Within both <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> groups (group D and group DN), no significant change in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29022">BAP</z:chebi> is observed, however group DN showed higher level of BGP, higher level of HOP and lower BMD than group D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Urine calcium was increased in both group D and DN with group D having higher levels than group DN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In DN patients had increased circulating phosphate and decreased urinary excretion of phosphate, while decreased circulating phosphate and increased urinary excretion phosphate are seen in group D patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with T2DM show an imbalance of bone mineral metabolism, and co-existence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> tends to aggravate this </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serum osteocalcin and 24-h <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18095">hydroxyproline</z:chebi> may be considered useful biochemical markers for monitoring possible bone mineral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolism disorder</z:e> in T2DM patients </plain></SENT>
