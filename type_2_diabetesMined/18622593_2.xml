<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested whether the release of somatostatin and glucagon, the two other major islet hormones, is also affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Mouse pancreatic islets were cultured for 72 h at 4.5 or 15 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> with or without 0.5 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30823">oleate</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The release of glucagon and somatostatin during subsequent 1 h incubations at 1 or 20 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> as well as the islet content of the two hormones were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">Lipid</z:chebi>-induced changes in islet cell ultrastructure were assessed by electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Culture at 15 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> increased islet glucagon content by approximately 50% relative to that observed following culture at 4.5 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inclusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30823">oleate</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> reduced islet glucagon content by 25% (at 4.5 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>) to 50% (at 15 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Long-term exposure to the NEFA <z:mp ids='MP_0002710'>increased glucagon secretion</z:mp> at 1 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> by 50% (when islets had been cultured at 15 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>) to 100% (with 4.5 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in the culture medium) and abolished the inhibitory effect of 20 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> on glucagon secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Somatostatin content was unaffected by <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, but <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced somatostatin secretion was reduced by approximately 50% following long-term exposure to either of the NEFA, regardless of whether the culture medium contained 4.5 or 15 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructural evidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_42'>lipid deposition</z:mpath> was seen in &lt;10% of non-beta cells but in &gt;80% of the beta cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Long-term exposure to high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and/or NEFA affects the release of somatostatin and glucagon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The effects on glucagon secretion are very pronounced and in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in vivo may aggravate the hyperglycaemic effects due to lack of insulin </plain></SENT>
