<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In the 26-week the Liraglutide Effect and Action in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> (LEAD)-2 core trial, patients (n = 1091) were randomized (2 : 2 : 2 : 1: 2) to liraglutide (0.6, 1.2 or 1.8 mg once-daily), placebo or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi>; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were enrolled if they were 18-80 years old with HbA1c 7.0-11.0% (previous monotherapy ≥3 months), or 7.0-10.0% (previous combination therapy ≥3 months), and body mass index ≤40 kg/m(2)  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients completing the 26-week double-blinded phase could enter an 18-month open-label extension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HbA1c decreased significantly with liraglutide (0.4% with 0.6 mg, 0.6% with 1.2 and 1.8 mg) versus 0.3% increase with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Liraglutide groups experienced significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> (2.1, 3.0 and 2.9 kg with 0.6, 1.2 and 1.8 mg, respectively) compared to <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> (0.7 kg) with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>Weight loss</z:hpo> with liraglutide 1.2 and 1.8 mg was significantly greater than with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy (1.8 kg; p = 0.0185 and p = 0.0378 for 1.2 and 1.8 mg, respectively) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Liraglutide was well tolerated overall: gastrointestinal events were more common than with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy, but occurrence decreased with time </plain></SENT>
