<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To further investigate the involvement of TCF7L2 in conferring susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we examined the association of TCF7L2 polymorphisms with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a Japanese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We analysed four SNPs (rs12255372, rs7903146, rs7901695 and rs11196205) and one tetranucleotide repeat polymorphism (DG10S478) in 1,630 Japanese subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 1,064 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> investigated polymorphisms were significantly associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and rs12255372 showed the strongest association (T vs G, chi2 = 9.20, p = 0.0024, odds ratio = 1.70, 95% CI = 1.20-2.41), although the frequency of the risk allele in our population was much lower than that in white populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The microsatellite polymorphism showed an almost complete linkage disequilibrium to rs1255372 when the alleles with longer repeats (+8, +12) were considered as minor alleles and showed an association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (chi2 = 5.34, p = 0.021, odds ratio = 1.50, 95% CI = 1.06-2.12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These results indicate that TCF7L2 might be a strong candidate for conferring susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> across different ethnicities </plain></SENT>
