<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among these factors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)gamma gene was identified as a genetic element which variant form, Pro12Ala, was shown to have differential metabolic activity than the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the mechanism of interaction between genetic and environmental factors in development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we analyzed prevalence and metabolic status in the context of the variant form of PPARgamma in 105 native Japanese and 145 Japanese American, both should have different environmental factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The observed frequency of Pro-allele in Japanese American with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was significantly higher than those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (NGT) (P=0.015), while that in native Japanese with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was not different from those with NGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, Japanese Americans with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with Pro/Pro genotype had significantly higher BMI (P=0.024) and higher fasting serum insulin (P=0.043) level than native Japanese, showing that individuals with Ala-allele could be more sensitive to insulin than those with Pro/Pro genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The data with emigrants suggests the possible interaction of gene-environment in the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
