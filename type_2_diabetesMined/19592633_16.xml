<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a population-based prospective cohort (European Prospective Investigation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> [EPIC]-Norfolk) study of men and women aged 40-79 years at baseline (1993-1997) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Habitual fish and seafood intake (white fish, oily fish, fried fish, and shellfish) was assessed using a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire and categorized as less than one or one or more portions/week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 10.2 (9.1-11.2) years, there were 725 incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> cases among 21,984 eligible participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Higher total fish intake (one or more versus less than one portions/week) was associated with a significantly lower risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (odds ratio [OR] 0.75 [95% CI 0.58-0.96]), in analyses adjusted for age, sex, family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, education, smoking, physical activity, dietary factors (total energy intake, alcohol intake, and plasma <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (BMI and waist circumference) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>White fish and oily fish intakes were similarly inversely associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk, but the associations were not significant after adjustment for dietary factors (oily fish) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (white fish) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fried fish was not significantly associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Consuming one or more portions/week of shellfish was associated with an increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (OR 1.36 [1.02-1.81]) in adjusted analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Total, white, and oily fish consumption may be beneficial for reducing risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, reinforcing the public health message to consume fish regularly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Greater shellfish intake seems to be associated with an increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, warranting further investigation into cooking methods and mechanisms </plain></SENT>
