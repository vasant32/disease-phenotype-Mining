<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: In patients with clinical <z:mp ids='MP_0005638'>hemochromatosis</z:mp>, the frequency of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> ranges from 20 to 50%, and the heterozygosity for the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene might be associated with an increased risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are also some reports that suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> might cause diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed an association study to assess the role of the C282Y and H63D mutations in the HFE gene as a risk factor for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Altogether, 563 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the analyzed group, 108 patients had overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo>, 154 had <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp>, and 301 had normoalbuminuria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the patients with normoalbuminuria, only those with known <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration &gt; or = 10 years were considered normoalbuminuric (n = 162) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 196 unrelated healthy subjects were used as a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects were genotyped for C282Y and H63D using the polymerase chain reaction-based protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was an increased frequency of 282Y allele carriers among patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> versus healthy control subjects (OR 5.3, 95% CI 1.6-17.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We observed an increased frequency of the 63D allele carriers among patients with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> (1.8, 1.2-2.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our study is the first to indicate that being a carrier of the H63D <z:mp ids='MP_0005638'>hemochromatosis</z:mp> mutation is a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We also confirmed previous observations that the frequency of the 282Y mutation was higher in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than it was in the general population of healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
