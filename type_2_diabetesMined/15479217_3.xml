<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi> modified release (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>), alone or combined with other oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drug(s) over 2 years in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two consecutive periods: (i) a 10-month, double-blind comparative study, where 800 type 2 diabetic patients were randomized either to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> (30-120 mg) once daily or to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi> (80-320 mg) twice daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients were then treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> for a 2-month switch period; (ii) 549 patients were subsequently enrolled in a 12-month, open-label period on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> alone or in combination according to glycaemic control, 507 of whom completed the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA1c) significantly decreased from baseline over 2 years by -0.46 +/- 1.08% in the whole cohort of 2-year completed patients, -0.95% in the subgroup of diet-failed patients and by -0.34% in the subgroup of patients pretreated with one oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HbA1c was reduced by -0.43 +/- 1.02% and by -0.51 +/- 1.16%, when <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> was used in monotherapy and in combination therapy, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall incidence of symptoms suggestive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> was 4.8 episodes/100 patient-year, with no severe episode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This incidence was similarly low in elderly patients and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>impaired renal function</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">Gliclazide</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> alone or in combination with another oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drug significantly improved glycaemic control in type 2 diabetic patients over 2 years with a very good safety profile, notably in the elderly and in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>impaired renal function</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
