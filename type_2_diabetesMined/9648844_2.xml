<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested whether endothelin (ET)-1 levels in this patient population differed from those in nondiabetic subjects after CABG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of 14 consecutive patients who underwent CABG by the same surgeon, 7 had type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 7 were nondiabetic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The two groups did not differ significantly in preoperative ejection fraction, number of vessels bypassed, cross-clamp time, or Parsonnet's score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Coronary sinus blood samples were obtained before cardioplegic arrest and then obtained at 1 and 15 min after each of two reperfusion periods: reperfusion A (native coronary perfusion plus the left internal mammary artery), reperfusion B (saphenous vein graft perfusion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ET-1 was significantly increased at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> reperfusion time points in diabetic patients compared with nondiabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In diabetic patients, reperfusion after CABG can trigger the release of ET-1, which may be a contributing factor in the increased cardiac morbidity seen in this patient population </plain></SENT>
