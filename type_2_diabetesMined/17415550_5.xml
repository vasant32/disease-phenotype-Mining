<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a two-stage association test using 1,762 Japanese persons with 485 gene-centric, evenly spaced, common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers with minor allele frequency &gt;0.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For mouse studies, total <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was extracted from various organs of BKS.Cg-+Lepr(db)/+Lepr(db) and control mice, and from MIN6, NIH3T3 and C2C12 cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We detected a landmark SNP375 (A/G) (rs2051211, p = 0.000046, odds ratio = 1.33, 95% CI 1.16-1.53) in intron 5 of the endonuclease G-like 1 (ENDOGL1) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Systematic dense SNPs approach identified a susceptibility linkage disequilibrium (LD) block of 116.5 kb by |D'|, an LD units map and a critical region of 2.1 kb by r (2) in ENDOGL1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A haplotype-based association test showed that an at-risk haplotype is associated with disease status (p = 0.00001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression of ENDOGL1 was rather ubiquitous with relatively abundant expression in the brain and also in a pancreatic islet beta cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mouse Endogl1 expression increased in pancreatic islets of hyperglycaemic BKS.Cg-+Lepr(db)/+Lepr(db) mice compared with that in control mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Based on the population genetics, fine mapping of LD block and haplotype analysis, we conclude that ENDOGL1 is a candidate disease-susceptibility gene for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a Japanese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further analysis in a larger sample size is required to substantiate this conclusion </plain></SENT>
