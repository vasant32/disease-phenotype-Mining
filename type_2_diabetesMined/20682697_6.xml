<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Seventy-two islet cell antibody-negative nondiabetic Hispanic women had oral (oGTT) and intravenous (ivGTT) <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> clamps, and body composition assessed between 15 and 30 months after pregnancies complicated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> mellitus (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They returned for oGTTs at 15-month intervals until they dropped out, developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, or reached 12 years postpartum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cox regression analysis was used to identify baseline predictors and changes during follow-up that were associated with development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, relatively low insulin sensitivity, insulin response, and β-cell compensation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> were independently associated with development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, weight and fat gain and rates of decline in β-cell compensation were significantly associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, while additional pregnancy and use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50745">progestin</z:chebi>-only contraception were marginally associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In Hispanic women, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> represents detection of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disease process characterized by falling β-cell compensation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Women who are farthest along at diagnosis and/or deteriorating most rapidly are most likely to develop type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> within 12 years after the index pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>Weight gain</z:mp>, additional pregnancy, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50745">progestin</z:chebi>-only contraception are potential modifiable factors that increase <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
