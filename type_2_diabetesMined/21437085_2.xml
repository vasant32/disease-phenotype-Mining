<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treatment is to prevent these outcomes by tight glycemic control and minimizing vascular risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>So far, even intensified combination regimen with the traditional antidiabetes agents have failed to obtain these goals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Incretin mimetics are a new class of antidiabetes drugs which involve modulation of the incretin system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They bind to and activate glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) receptors on pancreatic beta-cells following which insulin secretion and synthesis are initiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since the compounds have no insulinotropic activity at lower <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> - a well-known shortcoming of existing antidiabetes treatments - is low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, incretin mimetics have been shown to be associated with beneficial effects on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, decrease in blood pressure and changes in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Current clinical data on the two available incretin mimetics, exenatide and liraglutide, are evaluated in this review, focusing on pharmacology, efficacy, safety and tolerability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The review is built on a systematic PubMed and Medline search for publications with the key words GLP-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, exenatide, liraglutide and type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> up to January 2009 </plain></SENT>
