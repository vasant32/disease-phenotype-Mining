<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To determine the independent effects of total and each health professional's frequency of contacts, on changes in anthropometric measures and physical capacity following a lifestyle intervention offered by a multi-disciplinary team in adults at high risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 12-month lifestyle intervention was performed in 48 adults with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants were randomly assigned to either an individual counselling group (every six weeks)+an optional series of 25 group seminars (every week) or to the group seminars only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Physical activity level, energy intake, anthropometric measures, and physical capacity were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Total frequency of contacts with any professional was associated with change in body weight, BMI and, waist circumference (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P â‰¤.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, no frequency of contacts with a specific professional was associated with the studied outcomes, except for changes in physical capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The latest was significantly improved in participants who attended at least two group sessions with the kinesiologist (P=.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: To improve anthropometric measures, total contact frequency seems to be more important than contact frequency with any specific professionals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, to improve physical capacity, meeting with a kinesiologist for two or more occasions, in group sessions, seems to be an effective strategy </plain></SENT>
