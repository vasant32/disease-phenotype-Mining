<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the relative importance of parental history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and/or history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> as risk factors for the pathogenesis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in African-Americans remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, the objectives of the present study were 1) to characterize the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostatic regulations and 2) to examine the contribution of parental history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> to the potential metabolic alterations found in nondiabetic African-American women with a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> (HGDM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We evaluated beta-cell secretion, insulin sensitivity (SI), and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal (SG) in 15 glucose-tolerant African-American women with a parental history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and prior <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> (HGDM) and 35 women with a parental history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> but without prior <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> (NHGDM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifteen healthy nonobese nondiabetic subjects without a family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> served as control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Body composition was determined by bioelectrical impedance analyzer, and body fat distribution pattern was determined by waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Insulin-modified frequently sampled intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (FSIGT) test was performed in each subject </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SI and SG were determined by the minimal model method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age, BMI, percent body fat content, and lean body mass were not different between the subgroups of relatives with and without a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e>, but were greater than those of the healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean fasting and postchallenge serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were slightly but significantly greater in the HGDM versus NHGDM subjects and the healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were greater in the relatives with and without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> when compared with the healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast, mean postprandial serum insulin responses were significantly lower between t = 30 and 120 min in the HGDM versus NHGDM groups and the healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The mean serum insulin levels were not different in the NHGDM subjects and healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>During the FSIGT test, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> first-phase insulin release (t = 0-5 min) was significantly lower in the HGDM versus NHGDM groups and healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Mean SI was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) lower in the HGDM versus NHGDM subjects and healthy control subjects (1.87 +/- 0.47 vs. 2.87 +/- 0.35 and 3.09 +/- 0.27 x 10(-4).min-1.[microU/ml]-1, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>SG was significantly lower in HGDM than NHGDM subjects and healthy control subjects (2.11 +/- 0.15 vs. 3.25 +/- 0.50 and 2.77 +/- 0.22 x 10(-2).min-1, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Mean <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> effectiveness at zero insulin concentrations (GEZI) was significantly lower in the HGDM subjects when compared with the NHGDM and healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that in African-American women with a parental history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e>, defects in early-phase beta-cell secretion, as well as a decreased SI, SG, and GEZI, persist when compared with those without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>We suggest that African-American women with a positive history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> have additional genetic defects that perhaps differ from that conferred by a parental history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, the metabolic and hormonal milieu during <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> may be associated with permanent alterations in beta-cell function, SI, and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> effectiveness in African-American women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>These defects could play a significant role in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e>, and perhaps in the subsequent development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, in African-American women </plain></SENT>
