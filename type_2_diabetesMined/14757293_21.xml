<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To compare the efficacy of combination therapy using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> (8 mg per day) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> (7.5 mg per day) with upward titration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> as monotherapy (maximum dose=15 mg per day) in reducing HbA(1c) levels over 26 weeks in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three hundred and forty patients with T2DM inadequately controlled (FPG &gt; or =7.0 and &lt; or =15.0 mmol/l) on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> 7.5 mg per day were randomised to either additional treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> 8 mg per day or up-titration of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> dose (maximum dose=15 mg per day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 26 weeks, treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> combination reduced HbA(1c) by 0.81% (P&lt;0.0001) and FPG by 2.4 mmol/l (P&lt;0.0001) compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HOMA-S and HOMA-B increased by 12 and 28%, respectively (P&lt;0.0001 for both) with combination compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> combination and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> monotherapy, total cholesterol: <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> ratio reduced by 5 and 13%, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> reduced by 6 and 2%, and FFAs reduced by 15 and 8%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both treatments were well tolerated and had predictable safety profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: For patients inadequately controlled on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi>, addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> provides significantly improved glycaemic control compared with uptitration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This may be preferable to continued monotherapy with higher doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
