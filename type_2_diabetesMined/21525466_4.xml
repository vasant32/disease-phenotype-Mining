<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The complex pathological mechanisms responsible for development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are not fully addressed by conventional drugs, which are also associated with inconvenient side effects such as <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two types of incretin-based therapies are now in use: incretin mimetics (glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 [GLP-1] receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> that bind specific receptors and mimic the action of natural GLP-1) and incretin enhancers (inhibitors of the enzyme that degrade the incretin hormones and thus prolong their activity) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both offer important advantages over previous agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition to the proven <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering efficacy, they promote <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> (or are weight neutral) by slowing gastric emptying and inducing satiety, inhibit glucagon secretion with maintenance of counterregulatory mechanisms, and exhibit cardiovascular benefits, while having a low risk profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Importantly, short-term studies have shown that incretins/incretin-based therapies protect β-cells (by enhancing cell proliferation and differentiation and inhibiting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>) and stimulate their function (by recruiting β-cells to the secretory process and increasing insulin biosynthesis/secretion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These therapies have the opportunity to interfere with the disease progression if used as an early intervention, when enough β-cell mass/function can still be preserved or restored </plain></SENT>
