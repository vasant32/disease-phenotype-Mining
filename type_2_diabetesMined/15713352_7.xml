<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Voglibose at a dose of 0.4-0.6 mg/day was added on 51 subjects out of 101 type 2 diabetic patients being treated with diet, sulphonylurea (SU) or insulin injections, and the average (AveIMT) and maximum intima-media thickness (MaxIMT) of their carotid arteries were examined for 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Irrespective of the differences in treatments, addition of voglibose reduced the progression of AveIMT and MaxIMT to -0.024 +/- 0.047 (+/-S.D.) and -0.021 +/- 0.144 mm/year, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Without voglibose, diabetic patients showed significant (P &lt; 0.0001) progression of AveIMT and MaxIMT (0.056 +/- 0.046 and 0.098 +/- 0.122 mm/year, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The administration of voglibose resulted in a significant reduction of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA1c), total cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> concentrations, as well as an increase in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate regression analysis showed that administration of voglibose independently reduced the progression of AveIMT by 0.069 mm/year (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that voglibose reduces the progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> and may be a candidate for an anti-atherosclerotic drug for type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
