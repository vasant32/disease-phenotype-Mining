<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This procedure has been performed in small numbers of severely <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (DM1), but the impact on glycemic control and insulin requirement in this population has not been widely described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report three patients with DM1 and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> that underwent RYGB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Weight, glycemic control, and insulin requirements before and one year after the procedure were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> was achieved by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three patients but insulin requirements decreased in only 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, glycemic control (A1C) remained suboptimal in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three patients up to one year after the surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that RYGB leads to important <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and positively affects insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, reaching optimal glycemic control in patients with DM1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> remains challenging due to persisting insulin deficiency </plain></SENT>
