<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was undertaken to investigate the correlation between <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and apoptotic markers in lymphocytes of diabetic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> non healing wounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty healthy, thirty uncontrolled type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) and thirty uncontrolled T2DM with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>, non healing, neuropathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206172" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic foot</z:e> patients were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Indices of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> inside the lymphocyte lysate were estimated by measuring content of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD), Catalase, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">Glutathione</z:chebi> and malonaldialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Protein expression studies of pro and anti apoptotic markers were carried out to elucidate their possible involvement in diabetic context </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SOD and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> activity was significantly higher in the lymphocytes of diabetic patients having <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>, non healing diabetic wound as compared with healthy (p&lt;0.001); whereas catalase and GSH activity was significantly reduced (p&lt;0.001) in the same group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expressions of pro apoptotic markers (Caspase-3, Fas and Bax) were significantly higher whereas reduced expression of anti-apoptotic marker (Bcl-2) were obtained in lymphocytes of diabetic and non diabetic individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>Hyperglycemia</z:hpo> confers pro apoptotic manifestations which are mostly through altered indices of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> within lymphocytic milieu </plain></SENT>
