<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients were stratified according to the presence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Platelet aggregation was assessed using light transmittance aggregometry (groups 1 and 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Platelet activation (P-selectin expression and PAC-1 binding) was determined using whole-blood flow cytometry (group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">Clopidogrel</z:chebi> response was also assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In group 1, platelet aggregation was significantly increased in diabetic (n = 16) compared with nondiabetic (n = 36) patients at baseline and up to 24 h following a 300-mg loading dose (P = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In group 2, platelet aggregation and activation were increased in diabetic (n = 60) compared with nondiabetic (n = 60) subjects (P &lt; 0.05 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> platelet function assays) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Diabetic subjects had a higher number of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> nonresponders (P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Diabetic patients have increased platelet reactivity compared with nondiabetic subjects on combined aspirin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reduced sensitivity to antiplatelet drugs may contribute to the increased atherothombotic risk in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
