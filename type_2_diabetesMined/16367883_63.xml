<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Enrolled patients (n = 100, HbA(1c)&gt; or =7.5 and &lt; or =10%) were &gt; or =18 years of age, had <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> &gt; or =12 months and had received a stable <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> regimen for at least 3 months [minimum of two oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs (OADs) or at least one OAD plus once-daily basal insulin &lt; or =60 U] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients discontinued prior basal insulin and added one injection of BIAsp 30 (12 U or 70-100% of prior basal insulin dose within 15 min of dinner initiation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients self-titrated their BIAsp 30 dose with investigator guidance every 3 or 4 days to achieve pre-breakfast fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FBG) of 80-110 mg/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 16 weeks, a pre-breakfast injection of 6 U of BIAsp 30 was added if week 15 HbA(1c) exceeded 6.5%; the added dose was titrated to achieve pre-dinner BG of 80-110 mg/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After an additional 16 weeks, 3 U of pre-lunch BIAsp 30 was added if HbA(1c) exceeded 6.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This added dose was adjusted based on 2-h post-lunch BG to achieve postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> of 100-140 mg/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subjects achieving an HbA(1c)&lt; or =6.5% at 15 and 31 weeks completed the study at weeks 16 and 32 respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Addition of once-daily BIAsp 30 before dinner enabled 21% of the patients to achieve AACE and IDF targets (HbA(1c)&lt; or =6.5%) and 41% to achieve <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> targets (HbA(1c) &lt;7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With two daily injections of BIAsp 30, these glycaemic goals were achieved by 52 and 70% of subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>With three daily BIAsp 30 injections, 60% of patients achieved HbA(1c)&lt; or =6.5%, and 77% achieved HbA(1c) &lt;7.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This clinical trial demonstrates that initiation of once-daily BIAsp 30 to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients poorly controlled on various OAD regimens was an effective treatment approach for achieving glycaemic goals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Additional patients safely achieved these goals by increasing the number of BIAsp 30 injections from one to two, and then, if uncontrolled, from two to three doses per day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Eventually, most patients previously uncontrolled on OADs with or without basal insulin were controlled by the addition and vigorous titration of BIAsp 30 to oral agent therapy </plain></SENT>
