<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The prevalence of the MetS by modified World Health Organization criteria was analyzed in different categories of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance in a cross-sectional, population-based sample of 2,049 individuals (FINRISK) aged 45-64 years and in 522 participants of the Finnish <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Prevention Study (DPS) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the FINRISK cohort, the MetS was present in 38.8% of the men and 22.2% of the women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence was 14.4 and 10.1% in subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, 74.0 and 52.2% in subjects with impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, 84.8 and 65.4% in subjects with IGT, and 91.5 and 82.7% in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in men and women, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among women, the prevalence of the MetS increased with increasing age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the DPS cohort, the MetS was present in 78.4% of the men and 72.2% of the women with IGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The MetS was extremely common in middle-aged subjects The high prevalence in men was mostly due to their high waist-to-hip ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of the MetS increased in both sexes with deterioration in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Approximately 75% of the subjects with IGT had the MetS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because the syndrome includes the major risk factors for atherosclerotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular diseases</z:e> and is the major antecedent for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, concerted preventive action should be targeted to control <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the features of the MetS </plain></SENT>
