<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A population cohort with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was constructed in Tayside, Scotland, U.K., and longitudinally followed-up to June 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> registered with general practices and the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Audit and Research in Tayside, Scotland, database (97% sensitive) with no previous CHD event and with complete measurements (n = 4,569) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The main outcome measure was risk of CHD defined as fatal or nonfatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> or CHD <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, derived from the Weibull accelerated failure-time model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Validation of the algorithm was performed on an independent dataset from Salford, England, U.K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were a total of 243 subjects (5.3%) with a fatal or nonfatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> or CHD <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> over the follow-up period from 1 January 1995 to 30 June 2004 (maximum follow-up 9.5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The final Weibull model included the significant predictors of age at diagnosis, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, HbA(1c), smoking (current, past, never), sex, systolic blood pressure, treated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, total cholesterol, and height </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Assessment of discrimination and calibration in the Salford validation dataset demonstrated a good fit (c = 0.71 [95% CI 0.63-0.79]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first validated, population-derived model for prediction of absolute risk of CHD in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It provides a useful additional decision aid for the clinician treating type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by indicating appropriate early action to decrease the risk of adverse outcomes </plain></SENT>
