<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Activation of protein kinase C (PKC) by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> is implicated in the pathogenesis of long-term <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Monocyte activation and transformation into macrophages is a key step in the atherosclerotic process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in this study, we sought to determine 1) the effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> on monocyte PKC activity and on the distribution of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>-dependent and diacylglycerol-sensitive PKC isoforms; and 2) whether the effects on these parameters are determined by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> per se, independent of the diabetic state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The studies were performed in 19 type 2 diabetic patients and 14 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration was higher and insulin sensitivity lower (both P &lt; 0.01) in diabetic patients than in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Monocytes from diabetic patients showed similar cytosol PKC activity to those from control subjects but higher membrane PKC activity (78+/-6 vs. 50+/-5 pmol x min(-1) x mg(-1) protein; P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A direct correlation was observed between fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and membrane PKC activity (r2 = 0.4008, P = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, a reciprocal correlation was observed between membrane PKC activity and insulin sensitivity index (r2 = 0.28, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using immunoblotting analysis, we found that membrane beta2, but not alpha, isoform of PKC was more abundant in monocytes from diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In diabetic patients, when euglycemia was acutely induced, membrane PKC activity decreased by approximately 42% and beta2 isoform by approximately 15% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In two <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects in whom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> was induced, membrane PKC increased from 63 and 57 to 92 and 128.6 pmol x min(-1) x mg(-1) protein, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This increase was associated with an increase in the membrane isoform beta2; alpha isoform was unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We conclude that 1) monocytes express the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-sensitive beta2 isoform of PKC; 2) the prevailing plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> acutely regulates the activity of the membrane PKC and the content of membrane PKC beta2 isoform; and 3) this effect appears to be a direct effect of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> per se, since the phenomenon was observed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects when <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> was induced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Monocyte PKC activation may account for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0004943'>accelerated atherosclerosis</z:hpo> of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
