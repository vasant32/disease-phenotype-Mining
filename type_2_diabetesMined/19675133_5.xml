<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We investigated VEGF inhibition by dRK6 on the heart in an animal model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Male db/db and db/m mice either were treated with dRK6 starting at 7 weeks of age for 12 weeks (db/db-dRK6 and db/m-dRK6) or were untreated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cardiac dysfunction and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> were noted by echocardiogram and molecular markers in the db/db-dRK6 mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> significantly suppressed the expression of VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-1 and VEGFR-2, phospho-Akt, and phospho-endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (eNOS) in the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In db/db-dRK6 mice, dRK6 completely inhibited VEGFR-2, phospho-Akt, and phospho-eNOS expression, whereas no effect on VEGFR-1 was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003141'>Cardiac fibrosis</z:mp>, microvascular scarcity associated with an increase in apoptotic endothelial cells, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> were prominent, as well as increase in antiangiogenic growth factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cardiac 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanine and <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-inducible factor-1alpha expression were significantly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No such changes were found in the other groups, including the db/m-dRK6 mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The number of apoptotic human umbilical vein endothelial cells was increased by dRK6 in a dose-dependent manner only at high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations, and this was associated with a decrease in phospho-Akt and phospho-eNOS related to <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that systemic blockade of VEGF by dRK6 had deleterious effects on the heart in an animal model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; dRK6 induced downregulation of the VEGFR-2 and Akt-eNOS axis and enhancement of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
