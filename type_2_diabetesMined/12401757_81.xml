<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This open-label, active-controlled study investigated the cardiac safety and antihyperglycemic effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> (RSG) in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Of the 203 patients randomly assigned to RSG (4 mg b.i.d.) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi> (GLB) (titrated to achieve optimal glycemic control for the first 8 weeks only to limit the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>; mean 10.5 mg/day), 118 had an echocardiogram performed at week 52 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular (LV) mass index, ejection fraction, and left ventricular end-diastolic volume were assessed by M-mode echocardiography at baseline and weeks 12, 28, and 52; 24-h ambulatory blood pressure was assessed at baseline and at weeks 28 and 52 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Glycemic control was assessed by measuring fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) and HbA(1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Neither treatment produced an increase in LV mass index that exceeded 1 SD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ejection fraction did not change in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both groups had clinically insignificant increases in LV end-diastolic volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RSG, but not GLB, caused a statistically significant reduction in ambulatory diastolic blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both treatments reduced HbA(1c) and FPG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A total of 52 weeks of therapy with RSG (4 mg b.i.d.) did not adversely affect cardiac structure or function in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and produced significant and sustained reductions in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Decreases in ambulatory diastolic blood pressure with RSG were superior to those with GLB </plain></SENT>
