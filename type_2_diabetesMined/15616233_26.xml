<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Study participants were 197 adults with type 1 or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who completed the Insulin Delivery System Rating Questionnaire (IDSRQ), a self-administered questionnaire developed for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The IDSRQ assessed patient perceptions of treatment satisfaction, impact of treatment on daily activities, clinical efficacy, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related worries and social burdens, psychological well-being, and overall treatment system preference of patients using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) and multiple daily injections (<z:chebi fb="5" ids="53218">MDI</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The IDSRQ subscales had acceptable reliability (alpha = 0.67-0.92, median 0.82) and test-retest correlations (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.67-0.94, median 0.88) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Floor effects (0-10%, median 0%) and ceiling effects (0-18%, median 4%) were minimal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were statistically significant differences (P &lt; 0.05) between patients using CSII and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53218">MDI</z:chebi> on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> IDSRQ subscales except psychological well-being (P = 0.096); differences in means were 0.3-1.4 SD units (median 0.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multiple regression analysis (controlling for age, sex, and type of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) showed that treatment satisfaction, perceived clinical efficacy, and psychological well-being were independently associated with overall treatment preference and accounted for half of the difference in preference between CSII and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53218">MDI</z:chebi> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary findings suggest that the IDSRQ is a valid and reliable measure of HRQOL and treatment preferences for insulin delivery systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The subscales are comprehensive, sensitive to differences in user populations, and account for most of the preference for a particular insulin delivery system </plain></SENT>
