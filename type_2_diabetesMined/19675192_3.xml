<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The objective of the present study was to analyze the association between neighborhood deprivation and self-reported disability in a community sample of people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Random digit dialing was used to select a sample of adults with self-reported <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> aged 18-80 years in Quebec, Canada </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Health status was assessed by the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Material and social deprivation was measured using the Pampalon index, which is based on the Canadian Census </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Potential risk factors for disability included sociodemographic characteristics, socioeconomic status, social support, lifestyle-related factors (smoking, physical activity, and BMI), health care-related problems, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, insulin use, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-specific complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a strong association between disability and material and social deprivation in our sample (n = 1,439): participants living in advantaged neighborhoods had lower levels of disability than participants living in disadvantaged neighborhoods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The means +/- SD disability scores for men were 7.8 +/- 11.8, 12.0 +/- 11.8, and 18.1 +/- 19.4 for low, medium, and high deprivation areas, respectively (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The disability scores for women were 13.4 +/- 12.4, 14.8 +/- 15.9, and 18.9 +/- 16.2 for low, medium, and high deprivation areas, respectively (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neighborhood deprivation was associated with disability even after controlling for education, household income, sociodemographic characteristics, race, lifestyle-related behaviors, social support, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related variables, and health care access problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The inclusion of neighborhood characteristics might be an important step in the identification and interpretation of risk factors for disability in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
