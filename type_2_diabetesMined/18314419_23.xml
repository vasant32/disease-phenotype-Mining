<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In vitro and in vivo studies indicate that many drugs used for treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> (e.g., oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi>) are taken up into hepatocytes by distinct <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25696">organic anion</z:chebi> transporters (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="25696">organic anion</z:chebi> transporting <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> [OATPs]; gene symbol SLCO/SLC21) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25697">organic cation</z:chebi> transporters (OCTs; gene symbol SLC22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because most patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> receive more than one drug and inhibition of drug transporters has been recognized as a new mechanism underlying drug-drug interactions, we tested the hypothesis of whether oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs can inhibit the transport mediated by hepatic uptake transporters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using stably transfected cell systems recombinantly expressing the uptake transporters OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OATP2B1, or OCT1, we analyzed whether the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs repaglinide, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> influence the transport of substrates and drugs (for OATPs, sulfobromophthalein [BSP] and pravastatin; for OCT1, 1-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-4-phenylpyridinium [<z:chebi fb="26" ids="34761">MPP</z:chebi>(+)] and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> did not inhibit the uptake of OATP and OCT1 substrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, OATP-mediated BSP and pravastatin uptake and OCT1-mediated <z:chebi fb="26" ids="34761">MPP</z:chebi>(+) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> uptake were significantly inhibited by repaglinide (half-maximal inhibitory concentration [IC(50)] 1.6-5.6 micromol/l) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> (IC(50) 5.2-30.4 micromol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These in vitro results demonstrate that alterations of uptake transporter function by oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs have to be considered as potential mechanisms underlying drug-drug interactions </plain></SENT>
