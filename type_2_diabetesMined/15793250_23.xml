<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Liver X receptors (LXRs) are important regulators of cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism and are also involved in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the functional role of LXRs in human skeletal muscle is at present unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> ligand activation of LXRs by a synthetic LXR <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> increases the uptake, distribution into complex cellular <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, and oxidation of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> as well as the uptake and oxidation of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in cultured human skeletal muscle cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the effect of the LXR <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> was additive to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> effects of insulin on <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> uptake and metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Consistently, activation of LXRs induced the expression of relevant genes: fatty acid translocase (CD36/FAT), <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transporters (GLUT1 and -4), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15889">sterol</z:chebi> regulatory element-binding protein-1c, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi> palmitoyltransferase-1, and uncoupling protein 2 and 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, in response to activation of LXRs, myotubes from patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> showed an elevated uptake and incorporation of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> into complex <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> but an absence of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> oxidation to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results provide evidence for a functional role of LXRs in both <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism and energy uncoupling in human myotubes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, these data suggest that increased intramyocellular <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> content in type 2 diabetic patients may involve an altered response to activation of components in the LXR pathway </plain></SENT>
