<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the differences in insulin sensitivity and secretion between autoantibody-negative (Ab-) and -positive (Ab+) youth with clinically diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in comparison with control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Sixteen Ab- and 26 Ab+ clinically diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients and 39 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> control youth underwent evaluation of insulin sensitivity (3-h hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp), substrate oxidation (indirect calorimetry), first- and second-phase insulin secretion (2-h hyperglycemic clamp), body composition and abdominal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> (dual energy X-ray absorptiometry and computed tomography scan, respectively), and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposition index (first-phase insulin secretion x insulin sensitivity) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Insulin-stimulated total, oxidative, and nonoxidative <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal, and suppression of fat oxidation during <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> were significantly lower in Ab- compared with Ab+ clinically diagnosed type 2 diabetic and control subjects with no difference between the latter two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>First- and second-phase insulin secretion and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> were lower in Ab+ compared with Ab- type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> disposition index was not different between the Ab- and Ab+ clinically diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients, but both were significantly lower than that in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Systolic blood pressure and alanine aminotransferase were higher in Ab- versus Ab+ clinically diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients, whereas the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002919'>ketonuria</z:hpo> at diagnosis was higher in Ab+ versus Ab- patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Islet-cell Ab- clinically diagnosed type 2 diabetic youth are characterized by severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and relative insulin deficiency, whereas Ab+ youth have severe insulin deficiency and beta-cell failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The former group has additional features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These important metabolic differences could influence the natural history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, insulin dependence, and clinical outcomes in these youth </plain></SENT>
