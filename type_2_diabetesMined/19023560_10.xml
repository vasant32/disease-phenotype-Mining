<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> are known to play a crucial role in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control of insulin release and in the deterioration of beta cell function, as observed in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, actions of HSL in beta cells may be critical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This notion has been addressed in different lines of HSL knockout mice with contradictory results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To resolve this, we created a transgenic mouse lacking HSL specifically in beta cells, and characterised this model with regard to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism and insulin secretion, using both in vivo and in vitro methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that fasting basal plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were significantly elevated in mice lacking HSL in beta cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An IVGTT at 12 weeks revealed a blunting of the initial insulin response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> with delayed elimination of the sugar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, arginine-stimulated insulin secretion was markedly diminished in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Investigation of the exocytotic response in single HSL-deficient beta cells showed an impaired response to depolarisation of the plasma membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Beta cell mass and islet insulin content were increased, suggesting a compensatory mechanism, by which beta cells lacking HSL strive to maintain normoglycaemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Based on these results, we suggest that HSL, which is located in close proximity of the secretory granules, may serve as provider of a <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-derived signal essential for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
