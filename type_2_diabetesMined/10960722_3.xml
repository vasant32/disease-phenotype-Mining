<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine if islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (IAPP) secretion is disproportionate with other beta-cell products at any stage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo>, 116 subjects were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Non-diabetic subjects with equivalent body mass index (BMI) were assigned to three groups, (i) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, fpg&lt;5.5 mmol l(-1); (ii) intermediate fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, fpg&gt; or =5.5&lt;6.15 mmol l(-1); (iii) impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (IFG), fpg&gt; or =6.1&lt;7.0 mmol l(-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diabetic subjects were divided according to therapy (9 diet, 19 tablet, and 11 insulin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IAPP, C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> and proinsulin were measured fasting and at the end of a 1-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fasting C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, IAPP and proinsulin were significantly elevated in the IFG group compared with the other non-diabetic groups (P&lt;0.02); fasting IAPP/C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> and proinsulin/C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> were 1-2% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> non-diabetic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fasting and 1-h proinsulin and proinsulin/C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> were higher in diabetic compared with non-diabetic subjects (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IAPP and IAPP/C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> in diabetic groups were similar to that in non-diabetic subjects but reduced in the insulin-treated group (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Proinsulin was disproportionately increased compared with C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> and IAPP in Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> particularly in severe beta-cell failure implying more than one concurrent beta-cell pathology </plain></SENT>
