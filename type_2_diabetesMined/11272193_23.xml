<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Substantial new information has accumulated on molecular mechanisms of pancreas development, regulation of beta-cell gene expression, and the role of growth factors in the differentiation, growth, and regeneration of beta-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present review focuses on some recent studies on the mechanism of action of cytokines such as growth hormone (GH) and prolactin (PRL) in beta-cell proliferation and gene expression-in particular, the role of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The implication of the discovery of suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins for the interaction between stimulatory and inhibitory cytokines, including GH, PRL, leptin, and the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 and interferon-gamma, in beta-cell survival is not yet clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recent studies indicate a role of cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules and the delta-like protein preadipocyte factor 1/fetal antigen 1 (Pref-1/FA-1) in cytokine-induced beta-cell growth and development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) was recently found to stimulate not only insulin secretion but also beta-cell replication and differentiation, which may present a new perspective in treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Together with the intriguing reports on positive effects of insulin on both beta-cell growth and function, a picture is emerging of an integrated network of signaling events acting in concert to control beta-cell mass adaptation to insulin demand </plain></SENT>
