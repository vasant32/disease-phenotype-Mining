<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To clarify previous findings that <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> distress is related to glycemic control and self-management whereas measures of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> are not, using both binary and continuous measures of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Four hundred and sixty-three type 2 patients completed measures of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> distress (<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Distress Scale [DDS]) and clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (Patient Health Questionnaire 8 [PHQ8]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PHQ8 was employed as either a binary (&gt;or=10) or continuous variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dependent variables were A1C, diet, physical activity (PA), and medication adherence (MA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The inclusion of a binary or continuous PHQ8 score yielded no differences in any equation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DDS was significantly associated with A1C and PA, whereas PHQ8 was not; both DDS and PHQ8 were significantly and independently associated with diet and MA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The lack of association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and glycemic control is not due to the use of a binary measure of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Findings further clarify the significant association between distress and A1C </plain></SENT>
