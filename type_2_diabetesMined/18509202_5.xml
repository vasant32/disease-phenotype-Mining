<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002459'>autonomic dysfunction</z:hpo> was associated with glycemic control status over time in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: From 1999 to 2000, cardiovascular autonomic nerve function testing (AFT) was performed on patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 1,021) and was followed-up in 2006 and February 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Tests for cardiovascular autonomic functions measured heart rate variability parameters (expiration-to-inspiration [E/I] ratio, responses to the Valsalva maneuver, and standing) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AFT scores were determined from the results of the each test as follows: 0 for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and 1 for abnormal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We began with those who had a score of 0 and assessed the changes in total score along with biannual A1C levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At follow-up, the development of cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002459'>autonomic dysfunction</z:hpo> was 34.5% (E/I ratio 21.9%, Valsalva maneuver 77.8%, and posture 58.9%; n = 783) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The development of cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002459'>autonomic dysfunction</z:hpo> was higher in older patients (P &lt; 0.001); in those with longer duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P &lt; 0.001); of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (P = 0.005), and of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.001); and in those who had higher levels of <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis revealed that the development of cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002459'>autonomic dysfunction</z:hpo> was strongly associated with the mean A1C level during the follow-up period (mean A1C &gt;9.0% vs. &lt;or=7.0%, odds ratio 2.984, 95% CI 1.177-7.561; P = 0.021) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The development of cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002459'>autonomic dysfunction</z:hpo> was independently associated with microvascular complications and glycemic control status during this 7.5-year follow-up in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
