<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used the UK's General Practice Research Database (GPRD) to identify a cohort of women aged 40 years or over with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, treated with insulin during 2002-2006 and followed until the first <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> diagnosis or 31 December 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After the users of insulin glargine had been matched with users of other insulins on age, calendar time and duration of prior insulin use, the HR of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> associated with insulin glargine use was estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model, adjusted for known risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The cohort comprised 15,227 women, including 4,579 glargine users and 10,648 users of other insulins, of which 246 developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> during up to 8 years follow-up (incidence rate 4.1 per 1,000 per year) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Insulin glargine use was not associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> during the first 5 years of use (HR 0.9; 95% CI 0.7-1.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The risk tended to increase after 5 years (HR 1.8; 95% CI 0.8-4.0), and significantly so for the women who had been on insulin before starting glargine (HR 2.7; 95% CI 1.1-6.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> in women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is not increased during the first 5 years of insulin glargine use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, longer-term use may increase this risk, particularly in women with longstanding use of insulin before starting insulin glargine </plain></SENT>
