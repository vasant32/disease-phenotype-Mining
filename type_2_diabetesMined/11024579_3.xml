<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The total diabetic population is estimated as approximately 7 million with a prevalence of approximately 6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Along with genetically low postprandial insulin secretion, they are found to be less tolerable to being overweight to develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The body weight change in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetic</z:e> era consisting of 508 male patients treated on their diet alone was reviewed and it was found that a few kilograms of <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> could be a cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, inactive <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17478">aldehyde</z:chebi> dehydrogenese 2 (ALDH2), which is common in Japanese, is found to be a factor in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 163 diabetics, HbAlc of the inactive ALDH2 group was 8.1+/-1.3, while that of active ALDH2 was 7.5+/-0.9% (P&lt;0.05) in a light, social drinking group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, Japanese type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is also changing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In recent years, the data from a 75-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test of 2121 clients showed that insulinogenic index of clients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> was similar to that of a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance group and that the area under the insulin curve (AUC) was high in younger diabetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>From a life-style modification perspective, the importance of body weight control by diet and exercise as well as refraining from <z:mp ids='MP_0001426'>excessive drinking</z:mp> should be emphasized </plain></SENT>
