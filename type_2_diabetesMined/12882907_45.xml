<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) and protein kinase B (PKB), operating downstream of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase and its <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> product, PI-3,4,5-(PO(4))(3) (PIP(3)), apparently mediate insulin effects on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transport </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined these signaling factors during hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies in nondiabetic subjects, subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT), and type 2 diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In nondiabetic control subjects, insulin provoked twofold increases in muscle aPKC activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In both IGT and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, aPKC activation was markedly (70-80%) diminished, most likely reflecting impaired activation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1-dependent PI 3-kinase and decreased ability of PIP(3) to directly activate aPKCs; additionally, muscle PKC-zeta levels were diminished by 40% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PKB activation was diminished in patients with IGT but not significantly in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The insulin sensitizer <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> improved insulin-stimulated IRS-1-dependent PI 3-kinase and aPKC activation, as well as <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bicycle exercise, which activates aPKCs and stimulates <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transport independently of PI 3-kinase, activated aPKCs comparably to insulin in nondiabetic subjects and better than insulin in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Defective aPKC activation contributes to skeletal muscle <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in IGT and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> improves insulin-stimulated aPKC activation, and exercise directly activates aPKCs in diabetic muscle </plain></SENT>
