<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether breastfeeding is related to total <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e>, regional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e>, and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin dynamics in overweight Latino youth throughout puberty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The relation between breastfeeding and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk was determined in 240 overweight (BMI &gt; or =85th percentile) Latino children (aged 8-13 years) with a positive family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Children were examined at baseline (Tanner pubertal stage 1) and for 2 more years as they advanced in pubertal maturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Children were divided into the following categories: never breastfed (n = 102), breastfed 0-5.99 months (n = 61), breastfed 6-11.99 months (n = 24), and breastfed &gt; or =12 months (n = 53) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tanner pubertal stage was determined by physical examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Visceral and subcutaneous abdominal fat were determined by magnetic resonance imagining, and total body fat, total lean tissue mass, and percent body fat were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fasting and postchallenge <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> were assessed with a 2-h oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity (SI), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin response (AIR), and disposition index ([DI] an index of beta-cell function) were measured by frequently sampled intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test and minimal modeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Data were analyzed using linear mixed-effects modeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no significant effects of breastfeeding categories on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> (i.e., total fat mass, total lean tissue mass, percent body fat), fat distribution (visceral and subcutaneous abdominal fat), fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> or 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, or insulin dynamics (SI, AIR, and DI) at Tanner pubertal stage 1 or on changes in these variables over pubertal transitions in overweight Latino youth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this population of high-risk Latino youth, there were no significant protective effects of breastfeeding on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk factors at Tanner pubertal stage 1 or across advances in maturation </plain></SENT>
