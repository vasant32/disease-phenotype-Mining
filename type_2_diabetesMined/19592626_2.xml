<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We examined secular trends in the frequency distribution of <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in 1982-1988 and 2001-2006, two periods associated with major changes in the management of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The cross-sectional study included Pima Indians &gt; or =15 years old with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and measures of serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> and urinary albumin-to-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratios (ACR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The continuous probability density distributions of ACR and eGFR were compared for the two time periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>eGFR was calculated using the Modification of Diet in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Renal Disease</z:e> Study equation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall standardized distribution of ACR shifted toward lower values between time periods (P = 0.001), whereas the standardized distribution of eGFR did not (P = 0.45) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the first period, eGFR was &lt;60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) in 6.5% of the 837 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these, 9.3% had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ACR, 7.4% had <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp>, and 83.3% had macroalbuminuria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the second period, the prevalence of low eGFR was similar (6.6% of the 1,310 subjects) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among those with low eGFR, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ACR prevalence doubled to 17.2%, <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> prevalence nearly tripled to 19.5%, and macroalbuminuria prevalence declined to 63.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twice as many subjects in the second period received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> medicines and 30% more received hypoglycemic medicines than in the first period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> changed significantly among diabetic Pima Indians over the past 20 years, as treatment with medicines to control <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The distribution of eGFR, however, remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Consequently, the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> characterized by normoalbuminuria and low eGFR doubled </plain></SENT>
