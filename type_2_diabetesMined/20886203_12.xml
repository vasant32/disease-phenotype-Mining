<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Much of the evidence is based on a single 2 h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> value after oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance testing in epidemiological studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the association between various indices of glycaemia measured during everyday activities and metabolic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk factors in the A1C-Derived Average <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> (ADAG) study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Participants (268 with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 159 with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) completed 16 weeks of intensive continuous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring (CGM) and self-monitoring of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (SMBG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From these data, common indices of postprandial glycaemia, overall <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e>, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> variability and HbA₁(c) were derived </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For both <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> types, the overall strongest associations with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk factors were seen for the measures of average glycaemia (mean blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and HbA₁(c)) </plain></SENT>
