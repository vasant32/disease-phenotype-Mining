<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a parallel randomized controlled trial comparing three dietary advice groups each with 30% energy as fat: low fat, modified low fat, and modified low fat inclusive of 30 g of walnuts per day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifty-eight men and women, mean age 59.3 +/- 8.1 years, started the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dietary advice was given at baseline with monthly follow-up and fortnightly phone calls for support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Body weight, percent body fat, blood <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, HbA1c, total <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> capacity, and erythrocyte fatty acid levels were measured at 0, 3, and 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data were assessed by repeated-measures ANOVA with an intention-to-treat model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The walnut group achieved a significantly greater increase in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>-to-total cholesterol ratio (P=0.049) and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> (P=0.046) than the two other treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A 10% reduction in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> was also achieved in the walnut group, reflecting a significant effect by group (P=0.032) and time (P=0.036) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between groups for changes in body weight, percent body fat, total <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> capacity, or HbA1c levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The higher dietary polyunsaturated fat-to-saturated fat ratio and intakes of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="25681">omega-3 fatty acids</z:chebi> in the walnut group were confirmed by erythrocyte biomarkers of dietary intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Structured "whole of diet" advice that included 30 g of walnuts/day delivering substantial amounts of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26208">polyunsaturated fatty acid</z:chebi> improved the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
