<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study is based on the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Members of this large cohort were enrolled early in pregnancy and asked about <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> and other factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the 58,004 women included in the analysis, we identified 221 cases of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 88 cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> using the Medical Birth Registry of Norway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A logistic analogue of the proportional probability model, a Cox-like discrete-time model, was used to compute fecundability odds ratios (FORs) and 95% CI for type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, adjusted for maternal age and prepregnancy BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with non-diabetic women, the adjusted FOR for women with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 0.76 (95% CI 0.64-0.89) and the adjusted FOR for women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 0.64 (95% CI 0.48-0.84) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These FORs did not change substantively and remained statistically significant after excluding women with irregular menstrual cycles and accounting for cycle length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The results from the present study provide evidence of substantially decreased fecundability for women with type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, even among those with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> menstrual cycle </plain></SENT>
