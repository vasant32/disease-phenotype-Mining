<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We enrolled 747 consecutive patients undergoing coronary angiography for the evaluation of stable CAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mobility was assessed by the standardized timed-up-and-go (TUG) test, a functional test of physical performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mobility was impaired (TUG time &gt;10s) in 199 (26.6%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proportion of subjects with impaired mobility was higher among patients with T2DM than among non-diabetic individuals (40.2% vs. 22.0%; p&lt;0.001), whereas it did not differ significantly between patients with significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242231" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary stenoses</z:e> &gt;or=50% and those without such lesions (p=0.802) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate adjustment in logistic regression analyses confirmed that T2DM (adjusted odds ratio (OR)=2.05 [95% CI 1.35-3.11]; p=0.001) but not the presence of significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242231" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary stenoses</z:e> (adjusted OR=0.81 [0.55-1.21]; p=0.306) was independently associated with impaired mobility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: T2DM but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0004929'>coronary atherosclerosis</z:hpo> is an independent determinant of impaired mobility in the high risk population of angiographied coronary patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mobility enhancing exercise programs are needed for diabetic coronary patients </plain></SENT>
