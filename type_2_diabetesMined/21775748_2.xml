<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 207 Mexican-American patients recruited from federally funded community health centers in San Diego County with HbA(1c) &gt;8% were randomly assigned to the Project Dulce peer intervention or continuation of standard <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome of interest was HbA(1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The majority of subjects were born in Mexico, were female, were middle-aged, had less than an eighth-grade education, and had high baseline HbA(1c) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant time-by-group interaction effects for HbA(1c) (P = 0.02) and diastolic blood pressure (P = 0.04) indicated that the Project Dulce group exhibited greater improvement (i.e., decreases) across time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Within-group analyses showed that the intervention group exhibited significant improvements from baseline to month 4 in absolute levels of HbA(1c) (-1.7%, P = 0.001) and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (+1.4 mg/dL, P = 0.01) and from baseline to month 10 in absolute levels of HbA(1c) (-1.5%, P = 0.01), total cholesterol (-7.2 mg/dL, P = 0.04), <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (+1.6 mg/dL, P = 0.01), and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (-8.1 mg/dL, P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant changes were noted in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This randomized trial, using the Project Dulce model of culturally sensitive, peer-led education, demonstrates improvement in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and metabolic control and suggests that this low-cost approach to self-management education for high-risk diabetic populations is effective </plain></SENT>
