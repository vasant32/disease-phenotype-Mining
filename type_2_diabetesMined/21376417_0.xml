<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the effect of preferential postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> targeting drugs for postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control after optimizing fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> with basal insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study was performed in 58, insulin naïve type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was optimized by insulin glargine, nateglinide or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> was initiated and then crossed over after second wash out period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>75 g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test and 7 point self monitoring blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> for 3 days at the end of each period was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both drugs effectively reduced postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels compared with the insulin glargine monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found between nateglinide and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> in terms of mean <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level, standard deviation of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, mean average <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excursion and average daily risk range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Homeostasis model analysis (HOMA)% β, corrected insulin response and insulin-to-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> ratio were significantly higher in the responder group compared with the non-responder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no episode of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Nateglinide and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> are equally effective in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excursions during basal insulin treatment </plain></SENT>
