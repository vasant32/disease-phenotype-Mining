<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examined the renoprotective effects of RSV in db/db mice, a model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: db/db mice were treated with RSV (0.3% mixed in chow) for 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We measured urinary albumin excretion (UAE), histological changes (including mesangial expansion, fibronectin accumulation, and macrophage infiltration), <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> markers (urinary excretion and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> content of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine [8-OHdG], nitrotyrosine expression), and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">manganese</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (Mn-SOD) activity together with its tyrosine-nitrated modification and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> biogenesis in the kidney </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, and plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profiles were also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The phosphorylation of 5'-<z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>-activated kinase (AMPK) and expression of silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) in the kidney were assessed by immunoblotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: RSV significantly reduced UAE and attenuated renal pathological changes in db/db mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>Mitochondrial</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and biogenesis were enhanced in db/db mice; however, Mn-SOD activity was reduced through increased tyrosine-nitrated modification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RSV ameliorated such alterations and partially improved blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, and abnormal <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile in db/db mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Activation of AMPK was decreased in the kidney of db/db mice compared with db/m mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RSV neither modified AMPK activation nor SIRT1 expression in the kidney </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: RSV ameliorates renal injury and enhanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> biogenesis with Mn-SOD dysfunction in the kidney of db/db mice, through improvement of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> via normalization of Mn-SOD function and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RSV has antioxidative activities via AMPK/SIRT1-independent pathway </plain></SENT>
