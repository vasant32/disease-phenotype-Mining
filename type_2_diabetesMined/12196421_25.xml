<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Cohort studies indicate that cereal fiber reduces the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> (CHD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we assessed the effect of wheat bran on glycemic control and CHD risk factors in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 23 subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (16 men and 7 postmenopausal women) completed two 3-month phases of a randomized crossover study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the test phase, bread and breakfast cereals were provided as products high in cereal fiber (19 g/day additional cereal fiber) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the control phase, supplements were low in fiber (4 g/day additional cereal fiber) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between the test and control treatments, no differences were seen in body weight, fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, HbA(1c), serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoproteins</z:chebi>, blood pressure, serum <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi>, clotting factors, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi>, C-reactive protein, <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi>, calcium, iron, or ferritin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> oxidation in the test phase was higher than that seen in the control phase (12.1 +/- 5.4%, P &lt; 0.034) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the subjects originally recruited, more dropped out of the study for health and food preference reasons from the control phase (16 subjects) than the test phase (11 subjects) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High-fiber cereal foods did not improve conventional markers of glycemic control or risk factors for CHD in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> over 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Possibly longer studies are required to demonstrate the benefits of cereal fiber </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, cereal fiber in the diet may be a marker for another component of whole grains that imparts health advantages or a healthy lifestyle </plain></SENT>
