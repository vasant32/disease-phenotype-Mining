<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prior in vitro analysis has suggested that the forkhead/winged helix transcription factor Foxa2 (formerly HNF-3beta) is a major upstream regulator of Pdx1, a homeobox gene essential for pancreatic development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pdx1 is also essential for the maintenance of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis, as its human orthologue, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IPF</z:e>-1, is mutated in a subset of patients with early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (MODY4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To analyze the Foxa2/Pdx1 regulatory cascade during pancreatic beta-cell differentiation, we used conditional gene ablation of Foxa2 in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that the deletion of Foxa2 in beta-cell-specific knockout mice results in downregulation of Pdx1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and subsequent reduction of PDX-1 protein levels in islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data represent the first in vivo demonstration that Foxa2 acts upstream of Pdx1 in the differentiated beta-cell </plain></SENT>
