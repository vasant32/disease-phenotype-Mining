<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The current article discusses the results of 5.3 years of follow-up of 470 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and evaluates the effects of intensive and moderate blood pressure therapy using nisoldipine versus enalapril as the initial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> medication for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The 470 hypertensive subjects, defined as having a baseline diastolic blood pressure of &gt; or = 90 mmHg, were randomized to intensive blood pressure control (diastolic blood pressure goal of 75 mmHg) versus moderate blood pressure control (diastolic blood pressure goal of 80-89 mmHg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean blood pressure achieved was 132/78 mmHg in the intensive group and 138/86 mmHg in the moderate control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the 5-year follow-up period, no difference was observed between intensive versus moderate blood pressure control and those randomized to nisoldipine versus enalapril with regard to the change in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After the first year of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> treatment, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance stabilized in both the intensive and moderate blood pressure control groups in those patients with baseline normo- or <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, patients starting with overt <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> demonstrated a steady decline in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance of 5-6 ml.min-1.1.73 m-2 per year throughout the follow-up period whether they were on intensive or moderate therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was also no difference between the interventions with regard to individuals progressing from normoalbuminuria to <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> (25% intensive therapy vs. 18% moderate therapy, P = 0.20) or <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> to overt <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> (16% intensive therapy vs. 23% moderate therapy, P = 0.28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intensive therapy demonstrated a lower overall incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, 5.5 vs. 10.7%, P = 0.037 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Over a 5-year follow-up period, there was no difference between the intensive and moderate groups with regard to the progression of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, the use of nisoldipine versus enalapril had no differential effect on diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Blood pressure control of 138/86 or 132/78 mmHg with either nisoldipine or enalapril as the initial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> medication appeared to stabilize renal function in hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients without overt <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> over a 5-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The more intensive blood pressure control decreased <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality </plain></SENT>
