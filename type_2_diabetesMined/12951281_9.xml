<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Study participants were enrolled in a clinical trial for an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> medication or a clinical study of gastric bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Psychometric properties of the IWQOL-Lite were evaluated separately for <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> persons with (n = 225) and without (n = 972) type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Internal consistency reliabilities were similar for persons with and without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (0.981 versus 0.980) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Correlations between IWQOL-Lite scores and body mass index were significant and comparable for persons with and without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The IWQOL-Lite factor structure was similar for both the diabetic and non-diabetic subjects and consistent with earlier studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no difference between diabetic and non-diabetic subjects on weight-related QOL as measured by the IWQOL-Lite; however, subjects in this study had more impaired weight-related QOL relative to a reference sample of overweight/<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> community persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We recommend the use of weight-related QOL measures in addition to generic and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-specific measures when assessing quality of life in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, particularly when patients are overweight or <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
