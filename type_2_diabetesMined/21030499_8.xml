<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Coffee consumption has been inversely associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk, but its mechanisms are largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to examine whether plasma levels of sex hormones and <z:chebi fb="25" ids="50112">sex hormone</z:chebi>-binding globulin (SHBG) may account for the inverse association between coffee consumption and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a case-control study nested in the prospective Women's Health Study (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WHS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During a median follow-up of 10 years, 359 postmenopausal women with newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were matched with 359 control subjects by age, race, duration of follow-up, and time of blood draw </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Caffeinated coffee was positively associated with SHBG but not with sex hormones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariable-adjusted geometric mean levels of SHBG were 26.6 nmol/l among women consuming ≥4 cups/day of caffeinated coffee and 23.0 nmol/l among nondrinkers (P for trend = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, neither decaffeinated coffee nor tea was associated with SHBG or sex hormones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The multivariable-adjusted odds ratio (OR) of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for women consuming ≥4 cups/day of caffeinated coffee compared with nondrinkers was 0.47 (95% CI 0.23-0.94; P for trend = 0.047) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The association was largely attenuated after further adjusting for SHBG (OR 0.71 [95% CI 0.31-1.61]; P for trend = 0.47) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, carriers of rs6259 minor allele and noncarriers of rs6257 minor allele of SHBG gene consuming ≥2 cups/day of caffeinated coffee had lower risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in directions corresponding to their associated SHBG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that SHBG may account for the inverse association between coffee consumption and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk among postmenopausal women </plain></SENT>
