<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, beta-cell function in UCP2-deficient mice was examined after a 45% high-fat diet (HFD) to assess its role during the development of diet-induced type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HFD-fed UCP2 (-/-) mice have lower fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and elevated insulin levels when compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>UCP2 (-/-) mice also have enhanced beta-cell <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> sensitivity compared with WT mice after HFD, a result that is due in part to the deterioration of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> responsiveness in WT mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HFD-fed UCP2 (-/-) mice have increased insulin secretory capacity as a result of <z:mp ids='MP_0009113'>increased pancreatic beta-cell mass</z:mp> and insulin content per islet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Islets from WT mice exposed to 0.5 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> for 48 h have significantly reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane potential, ATP concentrations, and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> responsiveness compared with UCP2 (-/-) islets, suggesting that elevated UCP2 in WT mice increases proton leak and decreases <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> ATP production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Highly increased <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi> palmitoyl transferase-1 gene expression in UCP2 (-/-) mice is suggestive of enhanced fatty acid oxidizing capacity, particularly after HFD stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results further establish UCP2 as a component in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> sensing and suggest a possible new aspect of UCP2 function during the progression of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
