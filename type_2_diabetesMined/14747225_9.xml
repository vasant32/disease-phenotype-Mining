<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the tolerability, efficacy, and mode of action of Caiapo, an extract of white sweet potatoes, on metabolic control in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 61 type 2 diabetic patients treated by diet were given 4 g Caiapo (n = 30; mean age 55.2 +/- 2.1 years; BMI 28.0 +/- 0.4 kg/m(2)) or placebo (n = 31; mean age 55.6 +/- 1.5 years; BMI 27.6 +/- 0.3 kg/m(2)) once daily for 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each subject underwent a 75-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) at baseline and after 1, 2, and 3 months to assess 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, HbA(1c), total cholesterol, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After treatment with Caiapo, HbA(1c) decreased significantly (P &lt; 0.001) from 7.21 +/- 0.15 to 6.68 +/- 0.14%, whereas it remained unchanged (P = 0.23) in subjects given placebo (7.04 +/- 0.17 vs. 7.10 +/- 0.19%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels decreased (P &lt; 0.001) in the Caiapo group (143.7 +/- 1.9 vs. 128.5 +/- 1.7 mg/dl) and did not change in the placebo group (144.3 +/- 1.9 vs. 138.2 +/- 2.1 mg/dl; P = 0.052) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A decrease in body weight was observed in both the placebo group (P = 0.0027) and in the Caiapo group (P &lt; 0.0001), probably due to a better- controlled lifestyle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the Caiapo group, body weight was related to the improvement in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control (r = 0.618; P &lt; 0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two-hour <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were significantly (P &lt; 0.001) decreased in the Caiapo group (193.3 +/- 10.4 vs. 162.8 +/- 8.2 mg/dl) compared with the placebo group (191.7 +/- 9.2 vs. 181.0 +/- 7.1 mg/dl) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean cholesterol at the end of the treatment was significantly lower in the Caiapo group (214.6 +/- 11.2 mg/dl) than in the placebo group (248.7 +/- 11.2 mg/dl; P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No significant changes in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels or blood pressure were observed, and Caiapo was well tolerated without significant adverse effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the beneficial effects of Caiapo on plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> as well as cholesterol levels in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>For the first time, the long-term efficacy of Caiapo on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control was demonstrated by the observed decrease in HbA(1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Thus, the neutraceutical Caiapo seems to be a useful agent in the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
