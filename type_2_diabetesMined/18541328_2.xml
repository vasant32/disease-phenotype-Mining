<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> on <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, inflammatory markers and hepatic risk factors for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in overweight individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition we examined the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> on post-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> challenge levels of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Forty overweight individuals (BMI&gt;27kg/m(2)) were randomized in a double blind fashion to receive 6 months treatment with either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> 4mg/day or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Primary endpoints were markers of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> (plasma <z:chebi fb="39" ids="44785">peroxides</z:chebi>), inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-alpha and CRP) and postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism (<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Secondary endpoints were changes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> as measured by HOMA, first and second phase insulin secretion, adiponectin and effects on <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> and hepatic parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Plasma <z:chebi fb="39" ids="44785">peroxides</z:chebi> (-15%) decreased significantly during 6 months in the group that received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> compared with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fasting plasma insulin concentrations decreased by 24% and HOMA increased by 35% in those receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasma IL-6 (-25%), CRP (-55%) and GGT (-25%) concentrations declined significantly in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">Rosiglitazone</z:chebi> increased plasma adiponectin by 81% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> also resulted in significantly reduced first phase (-33%) and second phase (-20%) insulin release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In overweight non-diabetic people <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> reduces <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and improves insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">Rosiglitazone</z:chebi> also improves first and second phase insulin secretion and reduces markers of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and GGT </plain></SENT>
