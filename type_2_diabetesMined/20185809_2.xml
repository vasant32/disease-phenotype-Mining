<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Prior genome-wide association and exon array expression studies both provided suggestive evidence that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> signal regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) may influence in vivo insulin action in Pima Indians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genetic variants in or near ASK1 were analyzed to assess the role of this gene in insulin action and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Genotypic data from 31 variants were used to determine the linkage disequilibrium pattern across ASK1 in Pima Indians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight tag SNPs were initially genotyped in 3,501 full-heritage Pima Indians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Replication for association with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was assessed in a second population-based sample of 3,723 Native Americans and the published DIAGRAM study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Quantitative traits were analyzed in 536 nondiabetic Native Americans, and ASK1 expression was examined in skeletal muscle of 153 nondiabetic Native Americans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three tag SNPs were associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (rs35898099, P = 0.003, odds ratio [95% CI] 1.27 [1.08-1.47]; rs1570056, P = 0.007, 1.19 [1.05-1.36]; rs7775356, P = 0.04, 1.14 [1.01-1.28]) in the full-heritage Pima Indians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The association with rs35898099 was replicated in a second sample of Native Americans (P = 0.04, 1.22 [1.01-1.47]), while that for rs1570056 was replicated in the DIAGRAM study of Caucasians (Z statistic based P = 0.026; fixed-effect model, 1.06 [1.00-1.12]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk allele for rs1570056 was associated with reduced insulin action as assessed by either HOMA-IR in 2,549 nondiabetic full-heritage Pima Indians (P = 0.027) or a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp among 536 nondiabetic Native Americans (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Real-time PCR identified a positive correlation between ASK1 expression in skeletal muscle biopsies and in vivo insulin action (P = 0.02, r = 0.23), and the risk allele for rs1570056 was associated with lower ASK1 expression (P = 0.003, r = -0.22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ASK1 variants may increase susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by decreasing insulin sensitivity via reduced ASK1 expression </plain></SENT>
