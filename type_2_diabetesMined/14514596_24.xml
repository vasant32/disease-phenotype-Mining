<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In vitro studies suggested that these effects may be mediated via overproduction of monocyte chemoattracting protein (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>)-1/CCL2, which is a chemokine involved in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this study, fasting plasma leptin, soluble TNF-alpha receptor 2 (TNF-alpha-R2), and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1/CCL2 concentrations were measured in 207 middle-aged women (age 61 +/- 12 years, BMI 30.1 +/- 6.6 kg/m(2)), including 53 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 42 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo>, and 112 with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, to assess cross-sectionally their relationship with markers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and, longitudinally over 7 years, whether their circulating levels were associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, leptin and TNF-alpha-R2 were not different among groups; meanwhile, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1/CCL2 was increased in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When a multivariate analysis was performed, only age, leptin, and insulin retained an independent association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> mortality, with leptin showing a protective effect (hazard ratio 0.88; P &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1/CCL2 concentration was the only one to be increased in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with respect to nondiabetic women and the only one to be associated with increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> mortality after a 7-year follow-up period in the univariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate analysis, neither <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1/CCL2 nor TNF-alpha-R2 was associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> mortality, and inspection of the data showed that leptin, in both the univariate and multivariate analysis, was associated with a protective effect </plain></SENT>
