<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Globalization and global market have contributed to increased consumption of high-fat, energy-dense diets, particularly rich in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="26607">saturated fatty acids</z:chebi>( SFAs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="7" ids="26208">Polyunsaturated fatty acids</z:chebi> (PUFAs) regulate fuel partitioning within the cells by inducing their own oxidation through the reduction of lipogenic gene expression and the enhancement of the expression of those genes controlling <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> oxidation and thermogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, PUFAs prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> by increasing membrane fluidity and GLUT4 transport </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, SFAs are stored in non-adipocyte cells as <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (TG) leading to cellular damage as a sequence of their lipotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">Triglyceride</z:chebi> accumulation in skeletal muscle cells (IMTG) derives from increased FA uptake coupled with deficient FA oxidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High levels of circulating FAs enhance the expression of FA translocase the FA transport proteins within the myocites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The biochemical mechanisms responsible for lower fatty acid oxidation involve reduced <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi> palmitoyl transferase (<z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>) activity, as a likely consequence of increased intracellular concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15531">malonyl-CoA</z:chebi>; reduced <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase activity; and impairment of insulin signalling and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transport </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of IMTG depots is strictly associated with an improvement of insulin sensitivity, via a reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15351">acetyl-CoA</z:chebi> carboxylase (ACC) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression and an increased GLUT4 expression and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (PDH) activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In pancreatic islets, TG accumulation causes impairment of insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In rat models, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta-cell dysfunction</z:hpo> is related to increased triacylglycerol content in islets, increased production of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi> synthesis and beta-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The decreased insulin gene promoter activity and binding of the pancreas-duodenum homeobox-1 (PDX-1) transcription factor to the insulin gene seem to mediate TG effect in islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In humans, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and prolonged effects of FAs on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion have been widely investigated as well as the effect of high-fat diets on insulin sensitivity and secretion and on the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
