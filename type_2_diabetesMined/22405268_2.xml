<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>GLP-1 receptors are not restricted to the pancreas; therefore, GLP-1 RAs cause additional non-glycaemic effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Preclinical and clinical trial data suggest a multitude of additional beneficial effects related to GLP-1 RA therapy, including improvements in β-cell function, systolic blood pressure and body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These effects are of a particular advantage to patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, as most are affected by β-cell dysfunction, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transient gastrointestinal adverse events, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> and diarrhoea, are also common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To improve gastrointestinal tolerability, an incremental dosing approach is used with liraglutide and exenatide twice daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A potential protective role for GLP-1 RAs in the cardiovascular and central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> systems has been suggested from animal studies and short-term clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These effects and other safety aspects of GLP-1 therapy are currently being investigated in ongoing long-term clinical studies </plain></SENT>
