<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this prospective, randomized, controlled, multicenter study, 288 clinicians (39.6% family practice physicians, 37.9% general internal medicine physicians, and 22.6% nurse practitioners) were randomized to structured SMBG alone (STG; n = 72); structured SMBG with <z:chebi fb="14" ids="38291">DST</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="38291">DST</z:chebi>; n = 72); structured SMBG with an educational DVD (DVD; n = 72); and structured SMBG with <z:chebi fb="14" ids="38291">DST</z:chebi> and the educational DVD (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="38291">DST</z:chebi>+DVD; n = 72) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinicians analyzed 30 patient cases (type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>), identified the primary abnormality, and selected the most appropriate therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 222 clinicians completed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 30 patient cases with no major protocol deviations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significantly more <z:chebi fb="14" ids="38291">DST</z:chebi>, DVD, and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="38291">DST</z:chebi>+DVD clinicians correctly identified the glycemic abnormality and selected the most appropriate therapeutic option compared with STG clinicians: 49, 51, and 55%, respectively, vs. 33% (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.0001) with no significant differences among <z:chebi fb="14" ids="38291">DST</z:chebi>, DVD, and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="38291">DST</z:chebi>+DVD clinicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Use of structured SMBG, combined with the <z:chebi fb="14" ids="38291">DST</z:chebi>, the educational DVD, or both, enhances clinicians' ability to correctly identify significant glycemic patterns and make appropriate therapeutic decisions to address those patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Structured testing interventions using either the educational DVD or the <z:chebi fb="14" ids="38291">DST</z:chebi> are equally effective in improving data interpretation and utilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="14" ids="38291">DST</z:chebi> provides a viable alternative when comprehensive education is not feasible, and it may be integrated into medical practices with minimal training </plain></SENT>
