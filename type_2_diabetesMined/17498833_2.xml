<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In 1610 type 2 diabetics PAD was defined as ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI)&lt;0.9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PAD prevalence was 17%, increased with age, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration, HbA 1c levels, previous CV events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the prevalence of traditional CV risk factors between patients with and without PAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PAD patients had higher levels of fibrinogen (10.88+/-2.32 versus 10.2+/-2.23micromol/L; p&lt;0.0001), <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> (327.1+/-89.2 versus 315.2+/-83.3micromol/L, p&lt;0.01), pulse pressure (70+/-18 versus 60+/-16mm Hg, p&lt;0.0001), higher rate of <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> (21.3% versus 13.7%; p&lt;0.05) and lower glomerular filtration rate (GFR, 80.7+/-24 versus 89.9+/-22 ml/min/1.73 m2; p&lt;0.001) than those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In age-gender-adjusted analysis, smoking (OR 1.5; CI: 1.07-2.2), HbA 1c (OR 1.45; CI: 1.07-2.08), high pulse pressure (OR 2.81; CI: 1.63-4.82), reduced GFR (OR 2.16; CI: 1.4-3.3), <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> (OR 1.62; CI: 1.11-2.36), high fibrinogen levels (OR 2.03; CI: 1.34-3.07) were associated with PAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis age, male sex, smoking, high pulse pressure, low GFR, high fibrinogen levels, previous CV events were independent risk factors for PAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PAD prevalence is high in Type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Non-traditional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> may be involved in the development of this complication </plain></SENT>
