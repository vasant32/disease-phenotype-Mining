<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to assess the impact of an individualized simulated learning intervention on <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care provided by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCPs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Eleven clinics with 41 consenting <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCPs</z:e> in a Minnesota medical group were randomized to receive or not receive the learning intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each intervention <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCP</z:e> was assigned 12 simulated type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> cases that took about 15 min each to complete </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cases were designed to remedy specific physician deficits found in their electronic medical record observed practice patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>General linear mixed models that accommodated the cluster randomized study design were used to assess patient-level change from preintervention to 12-month postintervention of A1C, blood pressure, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relationship between the study arm and the total of intervention and patient health care costs was also analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Intervention clinic patients with baseline A1C &gt;or=7% significantly improved glycemic control at the last postintervention A1C measurement, intervention effect of -0.19% mean A1C (P = 0.034) and +6.7% in A1C &lt;7% goal achievement (P = 0.0099) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Costs trended lower, with the cost per patient -$71 (SE = 142, P = 0.63) relative to nonintervention clinic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The intervention did not significantly improve blood pressure or <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Models adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidity showed similar results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCPs</z:e> reported high satisfaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A brief individualized case-based simulated learning intervention for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCPs</z:e> led to modest but significant <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control improvement in adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> without increasing costs </plain></SENT>
