<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is suggested to be implicated in the development and progression of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> by playing a role in infiltration of monocyte/macrophage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have demonstrated that urinary monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (uMCP-1) is different at different stages of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on these findings, the aim of this study is to examine the level of uMCP-1 and its clinical significance at different stages of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> and at the same time to describe the relationship between uMCP-1 and the various parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-nine cases with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) were divided into three groups according to urine albumin excretion (UAE): <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> group, <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> group and macroalbuminuria group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The levels of uMCP-1, protein excretion, blood <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> nitrogen (BUN), serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> (s-Cr), glycohemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), blood pressure and blood fat were measured in 59 patients with T2DM and 27 healthy adults as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results Compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control, levels of uMCP-1 in T2DM were significantly high, which were already elevated in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> group, levels of uMCP-1 in <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> group and macroalbuminuria group were significantly high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Levels of uMCP-1 in macroalbuminuria group were higher than those in <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The level of uMCP-1 was positively correlated with UAE, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi>), total cholesterol (TC), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>) in T2DM patients, while it had no significant correlation with HbA1c(,) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> (TG) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 is suggested to be implicated in the development and progression of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is very important to measure the level of uMCP-1 in the diagnosis and intervention of early diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
