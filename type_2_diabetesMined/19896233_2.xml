<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To compare total costs and risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2D) initiated on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin versus glargine in a real-world setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study used claims data (10/2001 to 06/2005) from a privately insured U.S. population of adult T2D patients who were initiated on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> or glargine following a 6-month insulin-free period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A sample of 1698 glargine-treated and 400 NPH-treated patients met the inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Total and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related costs (inflation-adjusted to 2006) were calculated for 6-month pre- and post-index periods and compared between 400 patient pairs matched by a propensity score method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the post-index 6-month period, glargine patients incurred higher <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related drug costs than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> patients ($785 versus $632, p&lt;0.0001) but there were no significant differences in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related medical or total costs, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other total cost categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared to the pre-index period, glargine patient costs declined by $2420 (p=0.058) whereas <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> patient costs declined by $4200 (p=0.046), with no statistically significant group differences (p=0.469) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>-related claims (0.75% in both groups), mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>-related costs were $85 and $202 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> and glargine patients, respectively (p=0.564) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Initiation of either <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> or glargine was associated with major cost reductions and infrequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>-related claims </plain></SENT>
