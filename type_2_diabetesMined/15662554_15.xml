<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a 17-year prospective cohort study in 10,582 Japanese individuals (4287 men and 6295 women) aged 40-69 years living in five communities in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects were free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and CHD at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> was defined as a fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level of &gt;/=7.0 mmol/l, a non-fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> of &gt;/=11.1 mmol/l, or receiving medication for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The risk of non-embolic ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was approximately two-fold higher in diabetic subjects than in subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The multivariate relative risk after adjustment for age, community, hypertensive status, BMI, triceps and subscapular skinfold thickness (TSF and SSF), and other known <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> was 1.8 (95% CI 1.0-3.2) for men and 2.2 (1.2-4.0) for women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This excess risk was primarily observed among non-hypertensive subjects and individuals with higher values for measures of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> (BMI, TSF and SSF values above the median), particularly those with higher values for SSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The association between non-embolic ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> abnormality was particularly strong among non-hypertensive subjects with higher SSF values: the multivariate relative risk was 1.9 (1.0-3.7) for borderline <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 4.9 (2.5-9.5) for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In this cohort, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was a significant risk factor for non-embolic ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, particularly in non-hypertensive and non-lean individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Due to the nationwide decrease in blood pressure and increase in mean BMI among the Japanese population, with current levels approaching those observed in Western countries, the impact of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> abnormalities on risk of ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> represents a forthcoming public health issue in Japan </plain></SENT>
