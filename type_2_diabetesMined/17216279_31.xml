<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fat cells were prepared from abdominal subcutaneous biopsies obtained from 49 type 2 diabetic and 83 non-diabetic subjects and from omental biopsies obtained from 37 non-diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cell size and insulin action on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake capacity in vitro were assessed in isolated fat cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity in vivo was assessed with euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fasting blood samples were collected and adipokines and NEFA were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Negative correlations were found between subcutaneous fat cell size and insulin sensitivity assessed as M-value during clamp and as insulin action on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake in fat cells in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was seen in non-diabetic subjects after including age, sex and BMI in the analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No such relationship was found in type 2 diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In both groups, subcutaneous fat cell size correlated positively and independently with plasma levels of leptin but not to any of the other assessed adipokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In non-diabetic subjects, omental fat cell size was independently and negatively correlated with insulin action in subcutaneous, but not omental, fat cells in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Fat cell enlargement is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in non-diabetic individuals independently of BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This was not seen in type 2 diabetic subjects, suggesting that after development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> other factors, not related to fat cell size, become more important for the modulation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
