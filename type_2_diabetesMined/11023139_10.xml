<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a randomized 2-week crossover study on either a high-polyunsaturated or a high-monounsaturated fat diet in 11 well-controlled diabetic men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blood was taken fasting and for up to 8 h after a high fat meal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">Lipoproteins</z:chebi> were isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">Apolipoprotein</z:chebi> (apo) B48 and apo B100 were separated by PAGE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fatty acids were analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography RESULTS: Fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin levels were significantly higher on the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17351">linoleic acid</z:chebi> diet compared with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16196">oleic acid</z:chebi> diet (P &lt; 0.01 and P &lt; 0.002, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> levels were also significantly higher on the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17351">linoleic acid</z:chebi> diet (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Likewise, fasting chylomicron apo B48 and apo B100 (P &lt; 0.05) and postprandial chylomicron and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi> apo B48 and B100 (P &lt; 0.05) were also higher on the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17351">linoleic acid</z:chebi> diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that, in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16196">oleic acid</z:chebi>-rich Mediterranean-type diet versus a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17351">linoleic acid</z:chebi>-enriched diet may reduce the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> by decreasing the number of chylomicron remnant particles </plain></SENT>
