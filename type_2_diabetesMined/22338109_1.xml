<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We developed a nonlaboratory-based risk-assessment tool for identification of people at high cardiometabolic disease risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data of three population-based cohorts from different regions of the Netherlands were merged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Participants were 2,840 men and 3,940 women, white, aged 28-85 years, free from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and CKD diagnosis at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The outcome was developing cardiometabolic disease during 7 years follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Age, BMI, waist circumference, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> treatment, smoking, family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were significant predictors, whereas former smoking, history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo>, and use of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering medication were not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The models showed acceptable calibration (Hosmer and Lemeshow statistics, P &gt; 0.05) and discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve 0.82 [95% CI 0.81-0.83] for women and 0.80 [0.78-0.82] for men) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Discrimination of individual outcomes was lowest for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (area under the ROC curve 0.70 for men and 0.73 for women) and highest for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> mortality (0.83 for men and 0.85 for women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that a single risk stratification tool can identify people at high risk for future <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and/or CKD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The present risk-assessment tool can be used for referring the highest risk individuals to health care for further (multivariable) risk assessment and may as such serve as an important part of prevention programs targeting <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> cardiometabolic disease </plain></SENT>
