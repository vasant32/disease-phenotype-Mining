<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Beta-blocker therapy has been proven to reduce mortality and reinfarction after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI), but the impact of beta-blockers on cardiac outcomes in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in routine practice is not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of beta-blockers after MI in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using the Saskatchewan Health Databases, 12,272 patients with newly treated <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were identified between 1991 and 1996; 625 patients were subsequently admitted for MI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Beta-blocker exposure within 30 days of discharge was identified in 298 patients, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were followed until <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, coverage termination, or 31 December 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate proportional hazards models were used to assess differences in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality, recurrent MI, and 30-day <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause rehospitalization (the latter a proxy measure for drug safety) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients were aged 69 +/- 11 years old, 66% were male, and mean follow-up was 2.7 +/- 2.1 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, beta-blockers were prescribed for 48% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were fewer <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in the beta-blocker group versus control subjects (55 of 298 [18.5%] vs. 126 of 327 [38.5%], respectively, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, beta-blockers were not associated with improved survival in multivariate analyses (hazard ratio [HR] 0.89 [95% CI 0.63-1.25]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in rates of recurrent MI (adjusted HR 1.35 [0.93-1.95]) or rehospitalizations (adjusted odds ratio 1.40 [0.83-2.37]) between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Beta-blocker therapy <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856742" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">post-MI</z:e> was not associated with reduced mortality or fewer recurrent events in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in routine practice, although these medications were safe in this population </plain></SENT>
