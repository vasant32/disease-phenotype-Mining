<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: In patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, glucagon levels are often increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, pulsatile secretion of insulin is disturbed in such patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whether pulsatile glucagon secretion is altered in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Twelve patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 13 nondiabetic individuals were examined in the fasting state and after mixed meal ingestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Deconvolution analyses were performed on insulin and glucagon concentration time series sampled at 1-min intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both insulin and glucagon were secreted in distinct pulses, occurring at âˆ¼5-min intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, postprandial insulin pulse mass was reduced by 74% (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Glucagon concentrations were increased in the patients during fasting and after meal ingestion (P &lt; 0.05), specifically through an increased glucagon pulse mass (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In healthy subjects, the increase in postprandial insulin levels was inversely related to respective glucagon levels (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This relationship was absent in the fasting state and in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Glucagon and insulin are secreted in a coordinated, pulsatile manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A plausible model is that the postprandial increase in insulin burst mass represses the corresponding glucagon pulses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Disruption of the insulin-glucagon interaction in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> could potentially contribute to hyperglucagonemia </plain></SENT>
