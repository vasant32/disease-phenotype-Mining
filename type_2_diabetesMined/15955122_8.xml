<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical studies reported that TPM treatment <z:mp ids='MP_0001262'>reduced body weight</z:mp> and decreased fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with or without type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is unclear whether the blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-normalizing phenomenon observed during TPM treatment is a primary effect or the consequence of reduced food intake and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present studies, we chronically treated female <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats (fed with a diabetogenic diet) and db/db mice with TPM (30-300 mg/kg/day) to examine the effect of TPM on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> and its relationship with food intake and body <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our data showed that TPM treatment markedly reduced blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels in both ZDF rats and db/db mice without a significant reduction in body <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pair-fed db/db mice treated with the vehicle alone did not exhibit a significant decrease in blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels compared with mice fed ad libitum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TPM treatment increased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin release by 2-3-fold during an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test in both ZDF rats and db/db mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also observed a 1.4-fold increase of pancreatic insulin content and heightened insulin immunostaining in pancreatic beta cells in db/db mice treated with TPM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> effect of TPM is independent of the changes in body <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> and food intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Improved <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced insulin release may, in part, underlie the mechanisms by which TPM ameliorates the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
