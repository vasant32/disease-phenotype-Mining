<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the impact of exercise intensity on the benefits of exercise training remains to be established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we compared the clinical benefits of 6 months of continuous low- to moderate-intensity exercise training with those of continuous moderate- to high-intensity exercise training, matched for energy expenditure, in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty male <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients (age 59 +/- 8 years, BMI 32 +/- 4 kg/m(2)) participated in a 6 month continuous endurance-type exercise training programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants performed three supervised exercise sessions per week, either 55 min at 50% of whole body peak oxygen uptake (VO(2)peak (low to moderate intensity) or 40 min at 75% of VO(2)peak (moderate to high intensity) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, blood glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile, body composition, maximal workload capacity, whole body and skeletal muscle oxidative capacity and skeletal muscle fibre type composition were assessed before and after 2 and 6 months of intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The entire 6 month intervention programme was completed by 37 participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Continuous endurance-type exercise training reduced blood glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> levels, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> concentrations, body weight and leg fat mass, and increased VO(2)peak, lean muscle mass and skeletal muscle <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> oxidase and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50744">citrate</z:chebi> synthase activity (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No differences were observed between the groups training at low to moderate or moderate to high intensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: When matched for energy cost, prolonged continuous low- to moderate-intensity endurance-type exercise training is equally effective as continuous moderate- to high-intensity training in lowering blood glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> and increasing whole body and skeletal muscle oxidative capacity in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
