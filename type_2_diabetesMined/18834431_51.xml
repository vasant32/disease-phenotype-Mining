<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we quantified the beta-cell mass in pancreas obtained at autopsy of 57 type 2 diabetic (T2D) and 52 non-diabetic subjects of European origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sections from the body and tail were immunostained for insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The beta-cell mass was calculated from the volume density of beta-cells (measured by point-counting methods) and the weight of the pancreas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The pancreatic insulin concentration was measured in some of the subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>beta-cell mass increased only slightly with body mass index (BMI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After matching for BMI, the beta-cell mass was 41% (BMI &lt; 25) and 38% (BMI 26-40) lower in T2D compared with non-diabetic subjects, and neither gender nor type of treatment influenced these differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>beta-cell mass did not correlate with age at diagnosis but decreased with duration of clinical <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (24 and 54% lower than controls in subjects with &lt;5 and &gt;15 years of overt <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pancreatic insulin concentration was 30% lower in patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the average beta-cell mass is about 39% lower in T2D subjects compared with matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Its decrease with duration of the disease could be a consequence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> that, with further impairment of insulin secretion, contributes to the progressive deterioration of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We do not believe that the small difference in beta-cell mass observed within 5 years of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> could cause <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta-cell dysfunction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
