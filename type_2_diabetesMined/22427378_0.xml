<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to determine whether in T2DM patients aspirin enhances platelet isoprostanes, which are <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23899">eicosanoids</z:chebi> with proaggregating properties derived from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> oxidation by platelet NOX2, the catalytic subunit of reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13389">NAD</z:chebi> phosphate oxidase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A cross-sectional study was performed comparing T2DM patients, treated (n = 50) or not treated (n = 50) with 100 mg/day aspirin, with 100 nondiabetic patients, matched for age, sex, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> risk factors, and aspirin treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A short-term (7 days) treatment with 100 mg/day aspirin also was performed in 36 aspirin-free diabetic and nondiabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Higher platelet recruitment, platelet isoprostane, and NOX2 activation was found in diabetic versus nondiabetic patients and in aspirin-treated diabetic patients versus nontreated patients (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Platelet <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26995">thromboxane</z:chebi> (Tx) A(2) (P &lt; 0.001) was inhibited in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> aspirin-treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the interventional study, aspirin similarly inhibited platelet TxA(2) in diabetic and nondiabetic patients (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Platelet recruitment, isoprostane levels, and NOX2 activation showed a parallel increase in diabetic patients (P &lt; 0.001) and no changes in nondiabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that in aspirin-treated diabetic patients, <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>-mediated platelet isoprostane overproduction is associated with enhanced platelet recruitment, an effect that mitigates aspirin-mediated TxA(2) inhibition </plain></SENT>
