<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both the plasma t-PA and PAI-1 antigen levels were similar between the diabetic group (10.6 +/- 3.8 ng/ml; 27.7 +/- 11.6 ng/ml) and the control group (12.2 +/- 3.5 ng/ml; 27.7 +/- 9.6 ng/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The PAI-1 levels were evenly distributed from 5.93 to 52.7 ng/ml in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The difference of Lp (a) levels between the two groups was negligible (the diabetic group, median 11 mg/dl (range 0-72 mg/dl); the control group, median 13 mg/dl (range 0-55 mg/dl)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant correlations between PAI-1 levels and body mass index (BMI) were observed in both groups </plain></SENT>
