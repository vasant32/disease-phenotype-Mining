<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The profile of associated complications was also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two groups of diabetic siblings of Type 2 diabetic patients, matched for age, body mass index (BMI) and duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The siblings also had Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Group A comprised of siblings of probands with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (n = 30, M:F = 20:10) and Group B were siblings of probands without diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> (MAU) (n = 30, M:F = 14:16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Anthropometry, measurement of blood pressure and tests for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo>, MAU and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> and ECG and biothesiometry were carried out for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> study subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> was present in 15 (50%) siblings in group A and none in group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAU was detected in 26.7% (n = 7) in Group A and 3.3% (n = 1) in Group B (P = 0.057) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus a total of 22 out of 30 cases in Group A had <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In Group A, seven (23.3%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> was present in nine (30.0%) in group A, and in five (16.7%) in group B (NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> was found to be significantly higher in group A than in group B (33.3 vs 6.7%, chi2 = 5.1, P = 0.023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0010508'>Abnormal ECG</z:mp> changes were present in 10% and 6.7% in Group A and Group B, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In Group A, one patient had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo> (PVD) while in Group B none had PVD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A comparison of sib pairs, matched for age, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the level of metabolic control showed that there was strong familial clustering of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011881" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic kidney disease</z:e> in south Indians with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This was independent of the familial clustering of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of other vascular complications were also higher in Group A </plain></SENT>
