<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To review reliability, validity, and normative data from 7 different studies, involving a total of 1,988 people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and provide a revised version of the Summary of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Self-Care Activities (SDSCA) measure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The SDSCA measure is a brief self-report questionnaire of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-management that includes items assessing the following aspects of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> regimen: general diet, specific diet, exercise, blood-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> testing, foot care, and smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Normative data (means and SD), inter-item and test-retest reliability, correlations between the SDSCA subscales and a range of criterion measures, and sensitivity to change scores are presented for the 7 different studies (5 randomized interventions and 2 observational studies) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Participants were typically older patients, having type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for a number of years, with a slight preponderance of women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The average inter-item correlations within scales were high (mean = 0.47), with the exception of specific diet; test-retest correlations were moderate (mean = 0.40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Correlations with other measures of diet and exercise generally supported the validity of the SDSCA subscales (mean = 0.23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There are numerous benefits from standardization of measures across studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The SDSCA questionnaire is a brief yet reliable and valid self-report measure of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-management that is useful both for research and practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The revised version and its scoring are presented, and the inclusion of this measure in studies of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-management is recommended when appropriate </plain></SENT>
