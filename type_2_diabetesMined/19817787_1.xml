<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We review mechanisms of beta-cell failure in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A wealth of information indicates that it is caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948379" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">impaired insulin secretion</z:e> and decreased beta-cell mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, there appears to be a link between these two mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The earliest reaction to peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> is an increase in insulin production, owing primarily to increased secretion, and to a lesser extent to decreased clearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Experimental animal models indicate that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020459" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperinsulinaemia</z:e> promotes an increase in beta-cell mass, largely via increased beta-cell replication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, following the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of overt <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, there is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003677'>slowly progressive</z:hpo> loss of beta-cell function and mass, both in animal models and in diabetic humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is of great interest that most <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-associated genes identified in genome-wide association studies appear to be enriched in the beta-cell and to have the potential to regulate mass and/or function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Here, we review evidence derived from experimental animal models to unravel the mechanisms underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta-cell dysfunction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We focus primarily on signalling pathways, as opposed to nutrient sensing, and specifically on the notion that insulin and growth factor signalling via Foxo1 in pancreatic beta-cells links insulin secretion with cellular proliferation and survival </plain></SENT>
