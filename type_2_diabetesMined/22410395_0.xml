<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The incretin based therapies are an emerging class of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs, with two categories: one is glucagone like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> and the other one is dipeptidyl peptidase (CD26; DPP-IV) inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in the DPP-IV inhibitors category only few compounds are commercially available and also have some undesirable effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in the present work we tried to explore a naturally occurring compound <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28819">naringin</z:chebi> for its potential DPP-IV inhibition and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is noteworthy that this compound is abundantly present in orange peel and thus may provide cost effective treatment for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, especially type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we have conducted virtual docking study and observed tight binding of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28819">naringin</z:chebi>, as shown by higher negative values of H bond lengths, while in vitro DPP-IV inhibition assay has also shown better inhibition by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28819">naringin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vivo study, in response to 10 days administration of 40 mg/kg of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28819">naringin</z:chebi> twice daily to Wistar <z:mp ids='MP_0001189'>albino</z:mp> rats, inhibited the serum levels of DPP-IV activity, random <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration with concomitant increase in insulin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the comparisons were made with the standard commercially available drug <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
