<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to explore 1) prospective associations of B-type natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (BNP) levels in a non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> range with changes in markers of left ventricular (LV) function and 2) possible effect modification by type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a population-based cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Echocardiographic measurements were performed at baseline (2000-2001) and follow-up (2007-2009), together with standardized physical examinations and BNP measurements on 300 individuals (mean age 66 years, 32% with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) of the longitudinal Hoorn Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariate linear regression analyses were performed to investigate associations of baseline BNP (&lt;100 pg/mL) in individuals without prevalent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> at baseline with changes in LV mass index, LV ejection fraction, left atrial volume index, and ratio of early diastolic LV inflow velocity (E) to early diastolic lengthening velocity (e') (E/e') </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> individuals, higher BNP was associated with 8-year increases in left atrial volume index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Higher BNP was also associated with increasing LV mass index and E/e' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These associations were significantly stronger in individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with the nonsignificant associations in individuals without type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This 8-year follow-up study shows that higher BNP levels in a non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> range were associated with an increased LV mass and deteriorated LV diastolic function, particularly in individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This implies that the presence or absence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> should be taken into account if BNP levels are used to assess future <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
