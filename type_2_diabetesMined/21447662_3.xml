<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A cohort of 3,343 patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) monitored and treated in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Care System West-Friesland, the Netherlands, was followed from 2 to 6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Risk factors were measured, and two-field fundus photographs were taken annually and graded according to the EURODIAB study group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Latent class growth modeling was used to identify distinct developmental patterns of DR over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five clusters of patients with distinct developmental patterns of DR were identified: A, patients without any signs of DR (88.9%); B, patients with a slow regression from minimal background to no DR (4.9%); C, patients with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003677'>slow progression</z:hpo> from minimal background to moderate nonproliferative DR (4.0%); D, patients with a fast progression from minimal or moderate nonproliferative to (pre)proliferative or treated DR (1.4%); and E, patients with persistent proliferative DR (0.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients in clusters A and B were characterized by lower risk factor levels, such as <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration, HbA(1c), and systolic blood pressure compared with patients in progressive clusters (C-E) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Clusters of patients with T2DM with markedly different patterns of DR development were identified, including a cluster with regression of DR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These clusters enable a more detailed examination of the influence of various risk factors on DR </plain></SENT>
