<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This meta-analysis was aimed at evaluating the risk of those serious adverse events associated with GLP-1 agonists in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and clinicaltrials.gov were searched in order to identify longitudinal studies evaluating exenatide or liraglutide use and reporting data on AP or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios (ORs) were pooled using a random-effects model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>I(2) statistics assessed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-five studies were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neither exenatide (OR 0.84 [95% CI 0.58-1.22], I(2) = 30%) nor liraglutide (OR 0.97 [95% CI 0.21-4.39], I(2) = 0%) were associated with an increased risk of AP, independent of baseline comparator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pooled OR for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> associated with exenatide was 0.86 (95% CI 0.29, 2.60, I(2) = 0%) and for liraglutide was 1.35 (95% CI 0.70, 2.59, I(2) = 0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Liraglutide was not associated with an increased risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007115" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">thyroid cancer</z:e> (OR 1.54 [95% CI 0.40-6.02], I(2) = 0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For exenatide, no thyroid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Current available published evidence is insufficient to support an increased risk of AP or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> associated with GLP-1 agonists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These rare and long-term adverse events deserve properly monitoring in future studies evaluating GLP-1 agonists </plain></SENT>
