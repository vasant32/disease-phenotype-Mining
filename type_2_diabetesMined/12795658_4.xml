<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This prompted us to study in vitro and in vivo in a placebo-controlled study the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> on the redox-sensitive transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifteen patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> with a stable HbA1c over the last 6 months were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After sampling for determination of baseline values, 10 patients were changed to an equivalent dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi>, while the placebo group was maintained at <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> plus placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> dose in these patients was adjusted so that no change in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control occurred, allowing for direct comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The others were kept on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> and received additional placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 4 weeks of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> plus placebo, a second blood sample was taken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mononuclear cells were isolated and assayed in a tissue-culture-independent electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)-based detection system for NF-kappaB binding activity, and by Western Blot for nuclear localization of NF-kappaB-p65, the cytoplasmic content of IkappaBalpha and the NF-kappaB-controlled haemoxygenase-1 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in-vitro studies were implemented to demonstrate radical quenching properties of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> in the cell-free 2,2'-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="30106">azo</z:chebi>-bis(2-aminopropane)-dihydrochloride system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Baseline <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and HbA1c remained stable in the patients switched from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> to a corresponding dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> or kept on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> plus placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>While in the group of patients only taking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> plus placebo the NF-kappaB binding activity did not change significantly (p = 0.58), the NF-kappaB binding activity in the group of patients taking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> was reduced from 19.3 relative NF-kappaB-p65-equivalents to 15.5 relative NF-kappaB-p65-equivalents (p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB-p65 was reduced from 100% at baseline to 58% after 4 weeks (p = 0.04); the cytoplasmic localization of NF-kappaB-p65 increased from 100% to 129% (p = 0.03) and the cytoplasmic content of IkappaBalpha increased from 100% to 109% (p = 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The redox-sensitive haemoxygenase-1 antigen was reduced from 100% to 82% (p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>To prove directly that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> reduces NF-kappaB activation, we isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In vitro, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> reduced TNFalpha-(1 nmol/l) and <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> albumin (800 nmol/l)-induced NF-kappaB activation dose dependently, being half maximal at 120 micromol/l </plain></SENT>
