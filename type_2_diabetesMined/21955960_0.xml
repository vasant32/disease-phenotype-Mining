<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients aged ≤20 years at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, diagnosed between 1995 and 2010 were followed for at least 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Chi-square/Wilcoxon tests were performed to compare patient groups according to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> type after reclassification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From 580 study patients, 60 (10.3%) were reclassified, on average 2.4 years after initial diagnosis as follows: 23 (38.3%) as type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; 9 (15%) as <z:hpo ids='HP_0004904'>maturity onset diabetes of the young</z:hpo> (MODY); 20 (33.3%) as "other specific <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> forms" and 8 (13.3%) as "remission" of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients reclassified to type 1 were significantly younger (13.5 ± 2.9 versus 14.0 ± 2.6; p=0.027) and more often β-cell antibody positive at disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (80.0% versus 31.2%; p=0.002), while patients reclassified as MODY had significantly lower BMI-<z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> values than 520 patients with confirmed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (2.5 ± 1.1 versus 0.9 ± 1.1; p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The latter were also considerably more <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> than patients in "remission" and those reclassified to "other specific <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> forms" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: About 10% of patients in the DPV database, initially diagnosed as type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, were retrospectively reclassified </plain></SENT>
