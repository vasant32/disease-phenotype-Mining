<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The expression of these genes is also abnormally regulated in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate here that treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019204" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatoma</z:e> cells with 5-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="22512">aminoimidazole</z:chebi>-4-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="23004,37622">carboxamide</z:chebi> riboside (AICAR), an agent that activates <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (AMPK), mimics the ability of insulin to repress PEPCK gene transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It also partially represses G6Pase gene transcription and yet has no effect on the expression of G6PDHase or the constitutively expressed genes cyclophilin or beta-actin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Several lines of evidence suggest that the insulin-mimetic effects of AICAR are mediated by activation of AMPK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also, insulin does not activate AMPK in H4IIE cells, suggesting that this protein kinase does not link the insulin receptor to the PEPCK and G6Pase gene promoters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Instead, AMPK and insulin may lie on distinct pathways that converge at a point upstream of these 2 gene promoters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Investigation of the pathway by which AMPK acts may therefore give insight into the mechanism of action of insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results also suggest that activation of AMPK would inhibit hepatic gluconeogenesis in an insulin-independent manner and thus help to reverse the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
