<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The timing of prandial insulin administration may enhance its efficacy/safety and maintain effective weight control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examined the effect of postprandial vs. preprandial insulin glulisine on <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> and glycaemic control in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients taking basal insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a multicenter, randomized, open-label trial conducted in 45 centres in the USA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 716 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c) (HbA(1c) ) ≥ 7.5% and ≤10.0% were screened; 345 were randomized and 322 comprised the intent-to-treat group (premeal, 163; postmeal, 159) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Insulin glargine once daily, ±<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and subcutaneous injections of premeal or postmeal insulin glulisine were given for 52 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Main outcome measures included changes in HbA(1c) , fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and weight from study baseline to endpoint (week 52) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At study end, insulin glulisine achieved similar glycaemic control whether it was administered before or after meals (HbA(1c) : 7.04% premeal vs. 7.16% postmeal, p = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> incidence and severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> rates were not significantly different between premeal and postmeal groups; however, symptomatic and nocturnal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> rates were higher in the postprandial group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean body weight was lower in the postmeal group, with the difference between postmeal and premeal weight change from baseline to week 52 of -0.87 kg (p = 0.243) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Postprandial glulisine administration provided similar glycaemic control and was non-inferior to preprandial administration on <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>, without additional risk of severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e>, showing dosing flexibility and the feasibility of such approach when clinically indicated </plain></SENT>
