<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MIF expression can be regulated by <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin, but data on the association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are sparse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to test whether MIF is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and whether these associations are independent of metabolic and immunological risk factors and to compare the associations of MIF and IGT/type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with those of C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) with IGT/type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg/Kooperative Gesundheitsforschung im Raum Augsburg, Survey 4 (KORA S4) is a population-based survey performed in Southern Germany (1999-2001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of 1,653 participants aged 55-74 years, 236 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 242 subjects with IGT, and 244 normoglycemic control subjects matched for age and sex were included in this cross-sectional study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum concentrations of MIF were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum MIF concentrations are highly increased in individuals with IGT and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The associations of MIF with IGT and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were independent of classical risk factors and of CRP and IL-6 and were much stronger before and after multivariate adjustment than the associations of CRP and IL-6 with IGT and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that elevations of systemic MIF concentrations precede the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This finding may be relevant because MIF has been reported to contribute to the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related diseases such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
