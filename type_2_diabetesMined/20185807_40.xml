<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE Recent genome-wide association studies have revealed loci associated with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin-related traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to characterize 19 such loci using detailed measures of insulin processing, secretion, and sensitivity to help elucidate their role in regulation of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control, insulin secretion and/or action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We investigated associations of loci identified by the Meta-Analyses of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> and Insulin-related traits Consortium (MAGIC) with circulating proinsulin, measures of insulin secretion and sensitivity from oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests (OGTTs), euglycemic clamps, insulin suppression tests, or frequently sampled intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests in nondiabetic humans (n = 29,084) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS The <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-raising allele in MADD was associated with abnormal insulin processing (a dramatic effect on higher proinsulin levels, but no association with insulinogenic index) at extremely persuasive levels of statistical significance (P = 2.1 x 10(-71)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Defects in insulin processing and insulin secretion were seen in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-raising allele carriers at TCF7L2, SCL30A8, GIPR, and C2CD4B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities in early insulin secretion were suggested in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-raising allele carriers at MTNR1B, GCK, FADS1, DGKB, and PROX1 (lower insulinogenic index; no association with proinsulin or insulin sensitivity) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two loci previously associated with fasting insulin (GCKR and IGF1) were associated with OGTT-derived insulin sensitivity indices in a consistent direction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS Genetic loci identified through their effect on <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> demonstrate considerable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in associations with measures of insulin processing, secretion, and sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings emphasize the importance of detailed physiological characterization of such loci for improved understanding of pathways associated with alterations in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis and eventually type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
