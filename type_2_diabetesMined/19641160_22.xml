<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 1,741 men and women randomly selected from Central Pennsylvania were studied in the sleep laboratory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100785'>Insomnia</z:hpo> was defined by a complaint of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100785'>insomnia</z:hpo> with duration of &gt;or=1 year, whereas poor sleep was defined as a complaint of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393760" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">difficulty falling asleep</z:e>, staying asleep, or early final awakening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Polysomnographic sleep duration was classified into three categories: &gt;or=6 h of sleep (top 50% of the sample); 5-6 h (approximately third quartile of the sample); and &lt;or=5 h (approximately the bottom quartile of the sample) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> was defined either based on a fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &gt;126 mg/dl or use of medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the logistic regression model, we simultaneously adjusted for age, race, sex, BMI, smoking, alcohol use, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037315" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sleep-disordered breathing</z:e>, and periodic limb movement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100785'>insomnia</z:hpo> but not poor sleep was associated with a higher risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sleeping and &gt;or=6 h sleep duration group, the highest risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was in individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100785'>insomnia</z:hpo> and &lt;or=5 h sleep duration group (odds ratio [95% CI] 2.95 [1.2-7.0]) and in insomniacs who slept 5-6 h (2.07 [0.68-6.4]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100785'>Insomnia</z:hpo> with short sleep duration is associated with increased odds of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Objective sleep duration may predict cardiometabolic morbidity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100785'>insomnia</z:hpo>, the medical impact of which has been underestimated </plain></SENT>
