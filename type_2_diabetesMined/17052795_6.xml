<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ultimately, the development and continued progression of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is a consequence of the failure of the beta-cell to overcome <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Strategies that aim to prevent <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> must, therefore, ultimately aim to stabilize the progressive decline of the beta-cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical study evidence from several sources now suggests that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> (TZDs) have profound effects on the beta-cell, such as improving insulin secretory capacity, preserving beta-cell mass and islet structure and protecting beta-cells from <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, as well as improving measures of beta-cell function, such as insulinogenic index and homeostasis model assessment of beta-cell function (HOMA-%B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, intervention studies suggest that TZDs have the potential to delay, stabilize and possibly even prevent the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> on <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in high-risk individuals, and these effects appear to accompany improvements in beta-cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here, we review the evidence, from in vitro studies to large intervention trials, for the effects of TZDs on beta-cell function and the consequences for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering therapy </plain></SENT>
