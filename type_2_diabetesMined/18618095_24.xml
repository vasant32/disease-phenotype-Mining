<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed the effects of six of these regions on insulin secretion as determined by a hyperglycaemic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Variants of the HHEX/IDE, CDKAL1, SLC30A8, IGF2BP2 and CDKN2A/CDKN2B genes were genotyped in a cohort of 146 participants with NGT and 126 with IGT from the Netherlands and Germany, who <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> underwent a hyperglycaemic clamp at 10 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Variants of CDKAL1 and IGF2BP2 were associated with reductions in first-phase insulin secretion (34% and 28%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The disposition index was also significantly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For gene regions near HHEX/IDE, SLC30A8 and CDKN2A/CDKN2B we did not find significant associations with first-phase insulin secretion (7-18% difference between genotypes; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p &gt; 0.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of the variants showed a significant effect on second-phase insulin secretion in our cohorts (2-8% difference between genotypes, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p &gt; 0.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the gene variants were not associated with the insulin sensitivity index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Variants of CDKAL1 and IGF2BP2 attenuate the first phase of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion but show no effect on the second phase of insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results, based on hyperglycaemic clamps, provide further insight into the pathogenic mechanism behind the association of these gene variants with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
