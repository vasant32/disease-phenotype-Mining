<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, as reflected by elevated CRP levels, can help predict development of islet <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> or type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Children at risk for type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and followed in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>Autoimmunity</z:hpo> Study of the Young (DAISY) had blood samples drawn and frozen serum saved at various intervals after birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CRP was measured using a high-sensitivity sandwich enzyme immunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Islet autoantibodies (IAs) were measured using biochemical immunoassays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Elevations in CRP concentrations were significantly more frequent (P &lt; 0.01) in children who later developed type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (8 of 16 children) than in children negative for IAs at their last testing (3 of 26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Children with one or more positive IA were more likely to have elevated CRP concentrations (15 of 36) than IA-negative children (3 of 26; P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The finding of elevated CRP levels in infants and young children before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> adds to the evidence that the disease is an immunoinflammatory disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The elevated CRP levels may provide an additional marker for risk of progression to type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
