<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Liver X receptors (LXR) are important transcriptional regulators of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our previous report demonstrated that LXR activation inhibited pancreatic beta cell proliferation through cell cycle arrest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we explore the role of LXR activation in beta cell insulin secretion and the underlying mechanism that might be involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Mouse pancreatic islets or insulin-secreting MIN6 cells were exposed to the LXR <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, T0901317, and insulin secretion, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and fatty acid oxidation, and lipogenic gene expression were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27208">unsaturated fatty acid</z:chebi> eicosapentaenoic acid and the dominant negative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15889">sterol</z:chebi> regulatory element binding protein 1c (SREBP1c) were used to inhibit endogenous SREBP1c and evaluate the involvement of SREBP1c in <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta cell dysfunction</z:hpo> induced by LXR activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treatment with the LXR <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> decreased beta cell <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> sensitivity and impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion in vivo and in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was accompanied by derangements of beta cell <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> oxygen consumption, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> oxidation, ATP production and intracellular voltage-gated calcium channel flux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LXR activation also regulated the expression of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism-related genes such as Fas, Acc (also known as Acaca) and Cpt1a, and led to intracellular <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> accumulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further studies revealed that inhibition of SREBP1c abolished LXR activation-induced <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> accumulation and improved beta cell <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism, ATP production and insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our data reveal that aberrant activation of LXR reproduced the phenomenon of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta cell dysfunction</z:hpo> in the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Upregulation of SREBP1c production and the lipotoxicity mediated by it played a central role in this process </plain></SENT>
