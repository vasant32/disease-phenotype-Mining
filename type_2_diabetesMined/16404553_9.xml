<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Global gene targeting in mice and in vitro studies have suggested that IRS2 mediates the physiological effects of insulin in the liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reduced hepatic production of IRS2 is found in many cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To investigate the role of IRS2 in regulating liver function in vivo, we generated mice that specifically lack Irs2 in the liver (LivIrs2KO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hepatic insulin signalling events were examined in LivIrs2KO mice by western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis and insulin sensitivity were assessed by <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests and hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effects of high-fat feeding upon <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis were also determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Liver function tests were performed and expression of key metabolic genes in the liver was determined by RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Proximal insulin signalling events and forkhead box O1 and A2 function were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in the liver of LivIrs2KO mice, which displayed minimal abnormalities in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> homeostasis, hepatic gene expression and liver function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, hepatic <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> homeostasis and the metabolic response to a high-fat diet did not differ between LivIrs2KO and control mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that liver IRS2 signalling, surprisingly, is not required for the long-term maintenance of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> homeostasis, and that extra-hepatic IRS2-dependent mechanisms are involved in the regulation of these processes </plain></SENT>
