<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previously, we reported that FFAs caused increased nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) production, which damaged <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> DNA (mtDNA) and ultimately led to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in INS-1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To firmly establish the link between FFA-generated mtDNA damage and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, we stably transfected INS-1 cells with an expression vector containing the gene for the DNA repair enzyme human <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44605">8-oxoguanine</z:chebi> DNA glycosylase/apurinic lyase (hOGG1) downstream of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> targeting sequence (MTS) from <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">manganese</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Successful integration of MTS-OGG1 into the INS-1 cellular genome was confirmed by Southern blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Western blots and enzyme activity assays revealed that hOGG1 was targeted to mitochondria and the recombinant enzyme was active </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MTS-OGG1 cells showed a significant decrease in FFA-induced mtDNA damage compared with vector-only transfectants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, hOGG1 overexpression in mitochondria decreased FFA-induced inhibition of ATP production and protected INS-1 cells from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that mtDNA damage plays a pivotal role in FFA-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta-cell dysfunction</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, targeting DNA repair enzymes into beta-cell mitochondria could be a potential therapeutic strategy for preventing or delaying the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> symptoms </plain></SENT>
