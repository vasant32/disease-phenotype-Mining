<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial, 69 type 2 diabetic patients were randomly divided into four groups, each group receiving one of the following daily supplement for 3 months; group M: 200 mg Mg and 30 mg Zn (n = 16), group V: 200mg <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">Vitamin C</z:chebi> and 150 mg Vitamin E (n = 18), group MV: minerals plus vitamins (n = 17), group P: placebo (n = 18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fasting blood and urine samples were collected at the beginning and at the end of the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>, total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>-c) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-c) were measured enzymatically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">Apolipoproteins</z:chebi> (apo) A1 and B were measured by immunoturbidimetric method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adjustment for differences in baselines covariates and changes in variables during study were performed by analysis of covariance using general linear models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Results indicate that after 3 months of supplementation mean serum levels of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>-c and apo A1 increased significantly in the MV group by 24% (50.4 +/-19.3 mg/dl versus 40.6 +/- 10.8 mg/dl) and 8.8% (169.8 +/- 33.8 mg/dl versus 156.1+ /- 23.9 mg/dl), respectively (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no significant changes in the levels of these parameters in the other three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-c, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>, and apo B were not altered after supplementation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It is concluded that since co-supplementation of Mg, Zn, <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">Vitamins C</z:chebi> and E significantly increases <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>-c and apo A1, supplementation of these micronutrients could be recommended for the type 2 diabetic patients based on their daily requirements </plain></SENT>
