<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> is widely used for treating type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, but its actions are poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition to diminishing hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> output, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, in muscle, activates 5'-<z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which alone increases <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake and glycolysis, diminishes <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> synthesis, and increases oxidation of fatty acids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, such <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> effects may improve insulin sensitivity and insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> on insulin-sensitive signalling factors in human muscle have only been partly characterised to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, other substances that activate AMPK, e.g., <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22512">aminoimidazole</z:chebi>-4-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="23004,37622">carboxamide</z:chebi>-1-beta-D: -riboside (AICAR), simultaneously activate atypical protein kinase C (aPKC), which appears to be required for the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transport effects of AICAR and insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Since aPKC activation is defective in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we evaluated effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> therapy on aPKC activity in muscles of diabetic subjects during hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> therapy for 1 month, basal aPKC activity increased in muscle, with little or no change in insulin-stimulated aPKC activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> therapy for 8 to 12 months improved insulin-stimulated, as well as basal aPKC activity in muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, IRS-1-dependent phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase activity and Ser473 phosphorylation of protein kinase B were not altered by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> therapy, whereas the responsiveness of muscle aPKC to PI-3,4,5-(PO(4))(3), the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> product of PI 3-kinase, was improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These findings suggest that the activation of AMPK by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> is accompanied by increases in aPKC activity and responsiveness in skeletal muscle, which may contribute to the therapeutic effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
