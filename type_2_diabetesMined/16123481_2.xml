<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were randomized to either 10 sessions of biofeedback (electromyograph and thermal) and relaxation or 3 sessions of education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> sessions were individual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 39 participants were entered, and 30 completed the 3-month protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Average blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, A1C, forehead muscle tension, and peripheral skin temperature were assessed, and inventories measuring <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> were administered pre-randomization and after completion of treatment/control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Biofeedback and relaxation were associated with significant decreases in average blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, A1C, and muscle tension compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 3-month follow-up, the treatment group continued to demonstrate lower blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and A1C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both groups decreased scores on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> inventories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> had higher blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels and tended to drop out of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the use of biofeedback and relaxation in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for up to 3 months after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further research is necessary to determine the long-term effects of biofeedback and the effects of mood on patients' responses to treatment </plain></SENT>
