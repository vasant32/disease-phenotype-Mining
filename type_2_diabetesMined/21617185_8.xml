<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied the role of leptin in regulating the <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> adaptation to long-term caloric deprivation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> diabetic subjects over 16 weeks in the context of a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We then performed detailed interventional and mechanistic signaling studies in humans in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, metreleptin administration for 16 weeks did not alter body weight or circulating inflammatory markers but reduced HbA(1c) marginally (8.01 ± 0.93-7.96 ± 1.12, P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Total leptin, leptin-binding protein, and antileptin antibody levels increased, limiting free leptin availability and resulting in circulating free leptin levels of ∼50 ng/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consistent with clinical observations, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> metreleptin signaling pathways studied in human adipose tissue and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were saturable at ∼50 ng/mL, with no major differences in timing or magnitude of leptin-activated STAT3 phosphorylation in tissues from male versus female or <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> versus lean humans in vivo, ex vivo, or in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also observed for the first time that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in human primary adipocytes inhibits leptin signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, metreleptin administration did not alter body weight or circulating inflammatory markers but reduced HbA(1c) marginally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ER stress and the saturable nature of leptin signaling pathways play a key role in the development of leptin tolerance in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
