<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The development of new classes of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering medications, including in particular the incretin-based therapies, provides an opportunity to utilize combinations of medications which target multiple physiologic abnormalities in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Complementary combination therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> lowers <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> via enhancement of insulin secretion, suppression of glucagon secretion, and insulin sensitization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Use of this combination in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> management will provide a greater degree of glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>-lowering than that seen with the use of either drug as monotherapy, is unlikely to cause significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>, and is generally associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effectiveness, tolerability, and potential cost savings associated with the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> combination therapy make this an attractive option in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The possible beneficial effects of this therapy on beta cell function, as well as its cardiovascular impact, remain inadequately explored but are of significant interest </plain></SENT>
