<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We estimated risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and milder degrees of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> associated with parental <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among subjects of the population-based Framingham Offspring Study, in which participants are primarily Caucasian and at relatively low risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and for which both parental and offspring phenotypes were ascertained by direct examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Parental <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, assessed over 40 years of biennial follow-up, was defined by use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic drug</z:chebi> therapy or a casual plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level &gt; or = 11.1 mmol/l at any examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Offspring <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, assessed over 20 years of quadrennial follow-up, was defined by fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels &gt; or = 7.8 mmol/l at any two examinations, use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic drug</z:chebi> therapy at any examination, or with a 75-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (1980 World Health Organization criteria) at the most recent examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs for offspring <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance status using generalized estimating equations to account for differential correlations within and between families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 2,527 offspring came from 1,303 nuclear families, of which 77.6% had two or more siblings per family and in which the prevalence of parental <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 24.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean offspring age was 54 years (range 26-82), 53% were women, 8.6% had <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 11.4% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo>, 76.3% had no parental <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 10.5% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>maternal diabetes</z:hpo>, 11.5% had paternal <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and 1.7% had bilineal <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Relative to individuals without parental <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the age-adjusted ORs (95% CI) for offspring type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001952'>abnormal glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &gt; or = 6.1 mmol/l or 2-h postchallenge <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance &gt; or = 7.8 mmol/l) among individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>maternal diabetes</z:hpo> were 3.4 (2.3-4.9) and 2.7 (2.0-3.7), respectively; among individuals with paternal <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were 3.5 (2.3-5.2) and 1.7 (1.2-2.4), respectively; and among individuals with bilineal <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were 6.1 (2.9-13.0) and 5.2 (2.6-10.5), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although maternal and paternal <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> conferred equivalent risk for offspring type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, offspring with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>maternal diabetes</z:hpo> were slightly more likely to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001952'>abnormal glucose tolerance</z:hpo> compared with those with paternal <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Offspring with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>maternal diabetes</z:hpo> and an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> of &lt;50 years had marked increased risk for both type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (9.7, 4.3-22.0) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001952'>abnormal glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (9.0, 4.2-19.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that risk ratios for offspring type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are consistent with a simple additive risk model, where risk when both parents are affected equals the sum of risk when either parent is affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>maternal diabetes</z:hpo> to confer excess risk for mild but not overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo>, offspring of diabetic fathers may transit abnormal to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> relatively quickly, or diabetic mothers may transmit risk for a mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0003677'>slowly progressive</z:hpo> form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001952'>abnormal glucose tolerance</z:hpo> in addition to overt <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Very high risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011014'>abnormal glucose homeostasis</z:hpo> among offspring with young <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age-of-onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>maternal diabetes</z:hpo> is consistent with hypotheses that perinatal exposures increase <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Given equivalent risk ratios for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, fathers may transmit unique paternal genetic factors of similar strength to maternal environmental factors </plain></SENT>
