<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A survey was mailed to a nationwide sample of pediatric endocrinologists (PEs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS A total of 40% of PEs surveyed responded (211 of 527) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Concordance with current monitoring guidelines varied widely, ranging from 36% (foot care) to 93% (blood pressure monitoring) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Given clinical vignettes addressing <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp>, only 34% of PEs were fully concordant with current treatment guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reported barriers included concerns about patient adherence, insufficient scientific evidence about treatment, and lack of familiarity with current recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Providers aged &lt; or =45 years or in clinical practice &lt;10 years reported significantly more aggressive management behaviors and had higher concordance with guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS Screening and management of pediatric type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> varied widely among PEs, suggesting opportunities for quality improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>More aggressive management of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among younger providers may be related to recent training when type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was more common </plain></SENT>
