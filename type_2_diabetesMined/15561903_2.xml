<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">Sulfonylureas</z:chebi> and glinides have similar mechanisms of action but differ in receptor affinity and binding sites and in absorption and elimination rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This promotes differences in potency, rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, and duration of action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While prominent in single-dose studies, these differences have less importance during long-term <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> treatment: at ordinary dosages, rapid- and short-acting (glipizide) and slow- and long-acting (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi>) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> maintained continuously effective plasma levels and similar 24-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, there was no difference in patient outcome between the first-generation <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> chlorpropamide and the second-generation <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi> in the U.K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prospective <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the risk of long-lasting and hence dangerous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> is higher with these two long-acting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conversely, this risk should be low with the short-acting glinides, but seemingly at the expense of less effective <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most important kinetics-effect relations are that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> delays <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> absorption and that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> dose-response curve is bell shaped; continuous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> exposure over a certain level (e.g., 10 mg glipizide) impairs rather than improves insulin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> responses to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> (downregulation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, a vicious circle may be established: unrelenting <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> may promote <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> dose increase, which increases <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, promoting further dose increase and eventually therapeutic failure </plain></SENT>
