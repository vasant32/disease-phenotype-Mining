<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We searched <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the publications about the association between SLC30A8 and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from PubMed, and evaluated the association between SLC30A8 rs13266634 C/T polymorphism and T2DM, IGT and T1DM, respectively, by meta-analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the validated studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Allelic and genotypic comparisons between cases and controls were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty six studies were included in the meta-analysis: 31 studies were analysed for rs13266634 C/T polymorphism with T2DM, 3 studies with IGT and 4 studies with T1DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The pooled odds ratios (ORs) for allelic and genotypic comparisons (including additive model, co-dominant model, dominant model and recessive model) showed that rs13266634 C/T polymorphism was significantly associated with increased T2DM risk: OR=1.15, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.13-1.17, P&lt;0.001, P(<z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>)=0.041, OR=1.34, 95% CI=1.26-1.41, P&lt;0.001, P(<z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>)=0.908, OR=1.20, 95% CI=1.16-1.24, P&lt;0.001, P(<z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>)=0.699, and OR=1.23, 95% CI=1.17-1.30, P&lt;0.001, P(<z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>)=0.801, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In subgroup analyses, we found that rs13266634 C/T polymorphism was associated with T2DM risk both in Asian and European subgroup (P&lt;0.001), but not in African (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>And the pooled odds ratio (OR) for allelic frequency comparison showed that rs13266634 C/T polymorphism was also significantly associated with IGT: OR=1.15, 95% CI=1.06-1.26, P&lt;0.001, P(<z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>)=0.364 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, our meta-analysis did not suggest that rs13266634 C/T polymorphism was associated with T1DM risk (P&gt;0.05): OR=1.02, 95% CI=0.98-1.06, P=0.328, P(<z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>)=0.488 for allelic frequency comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis results revealed the significant association between rs13266634 C/T polymorphism and T2DM and IGT, but did not support the association between this polymorphism and T1DM </plain></SENT>
