<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Resistin is an adipocyte-secreted cytokine associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that the G/G genotype of a resistin single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at -420 increases type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility by enhancing its promoter activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to determine the relevance of SNP -120 in a large number of subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We examined 2,610 type 2 diabetic case and 2,502 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relation between SNP -420 and the age of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was further analyzed by adding 237 type 2 diabetic subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> &lt;or=40 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: When analyzed without considering subject age, the SNP -420 genotype was not associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since we reported that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was earlier in G/G genotype, we analyzed the data using a trend test for age intervals of 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequency of G/G genotype differed among age grades in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P = 0.037) and appeared to be higher in younger grades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, G/G genotype was more frequent in subjects aged &lt;40 years than in those aged &gt;or=40 years (G/G vs. C/C, P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In a total of 2,430 type 2 diabetic subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> &lt;60 years, the trend test showed that the G/G genotype had an increasing linear trend as the age grade of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> became younger (P = 0.0379) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In control subjects, the frequency of C/G genotype showed an increasing linear trend with increasing age (P = 0.010) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The G/G genotype frequency of resistin SNP -420 appears to be increased in younger-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
