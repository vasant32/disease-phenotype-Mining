<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Studies of the genetic basis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> suggest that variation in the calpain-10 gene affects susceptibility to this common disorder, raising the possibility that calpain-sensitive pathways may play a role in regulating insulin secretion and/or action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Calpains are ubiquitously expressed cysteine proteases that are thought to regulate a variety of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cellular functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we report that short-term (4-h) exposure to the cell-permeable calpain inhibitors calpain inhibitor II and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30270">E-64</z:chebi>-d increases the insulin secretory response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in mouse pancreatic islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This dose-dependent effect is observed at <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations above 8 mmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This effect was also seen with other calpain inhibitors with different mechanisms of action but not with cathepsin inhibitors or other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37670">protease inhibitors</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Enhancement of insulin secretion with short-term exposure to calpain inhibitors is not mediated by increased responses in intracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> or increased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in islets but by accelerated exocytosis of insulin granules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In muscle strips and adipocytes, exposure to both calpain inhibitor II and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30270">E-64</z:chebi>-d reduced insulin-mediated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transport </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Incorporation of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> into <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> in muscle also was reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results are consistent with a role for calpains in the regulation of insulin secretion and insulin action </plain></SENT>
