<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fine mapping identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near the CACNA1E gene associated with this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CACNA1E encodes the voltage-dependent calcium channel Ca(v)2.3 Ca(2+), and mice lacking this channel exhibit <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> and insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, CACNA1E was investigated as a positional candidate gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: CACNA1E was sequenced, and 28 SNPs were genotyped in the same group of Pima subjects who had been analyzed in the linkage study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Allele-specific expression was used to functionally evaluate a variant in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A novel G/A variant in the 3'-UTR was associated with young-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (odds ratio 2.09 per copy of the G-allele [95% CI 1.31-3.33], adjusted P = 0.001) and had an effect on the evidence for linkage at chromosome 1q21-25 (P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among 372 nondiabetic Pima subjects who had undergone metabolic testing, the risk allele was associated with reduced insulin action including increased fasting, 30, 60, and 120 min plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations and increased fasting plasma insulin during an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.01), as well as a decreased rate of insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal at both physiologically and maximally stimulated insulin concentrations (both P &lt; 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Functional analysis of this variant showed that the nonrisk allele had a 2.3-fold higher expression compared with the risk allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A functional variant in CACNA1E contributes to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility by affecting insulin action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This variant partially explains the linkage to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on chromosome 1q21-25 in Pima Indians </plain></SENT>
