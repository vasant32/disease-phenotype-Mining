<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS, MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1995 and 1999, 2,838 type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients underwent comprehensive assessments and blood screening for <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B surface antigen (HBsAg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The risk of occurrence of cardiovascular events and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal disease</z:hpo> (defined as need for dialysis, doubling of serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> or serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> &gt; or =500 micromol/l) was compared between HBsAg-positive and HBsAg-negative groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, HBV-infected patients (n=286, 10.1%) were younger (51.0+/-11.5 vs 53.7+/-12.7 years, p=0.004), had earlier <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (51.0+/-11.5 vs 53.7+/-12.7 years, p=0.001) and a higher frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (28 vs 22%, p=0.03) than non-HBV-infected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 3.5 years (interquartile range: 1.7-5.9 years) and adjustment of age, glycaemic control and other potential confounding factors, HBV-infected patients were more likely to develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal disease</z:hpo> than non-HBV infected patients (8.7 vs 6.4%) with a hazard ratio of 4.5 (95% CI 1.1-18.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The difference in the frequency of cardiovascular endpoints was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In Chinese type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> HBV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> was associated with increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal disease</z:hpo>, and this was independent of other potential confounding factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Early identification of HBV status and close surveillance of renal function are important in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who are living in areas where HBV is endemic or who are at risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> HBV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
