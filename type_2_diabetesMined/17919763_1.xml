<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This 24-week, open-label, single-arm study was conducted in eight centers in Brazil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hundred ethnic Japanese T2DM patients with inadequate glycemic control [HbA(1c): 8.0-11.0% and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG)&gt;or=140 mg/dL] on oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs (OADs) were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were treated once daily with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> 3mg (morning) and glargine (bedtime) with dose titration to achieve FPG 72-100mg/dL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At Week 24, the mean dose of glargine was 37.6 IU/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were significant decreases (p&lt;0.0001) compared with baseline, for mean HbA(1c) (1.5%), mean FPG (88.3mg/dL) (p&lt;0.0001), mean <z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi> (112.0mg/dL), and mean fasting C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (1.14 ng/mL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">Peptide</z:chebi> index (peak-basal/basal) in carbohydrate challenge test increased by 2.24 units </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No severe adverse events, including severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that combined therapy of insulin glargine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> should be considered for T2DM patients who have unsatisfactory response to previous OAD treatment </plain></SENT>
