<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is a leading cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal disease</z:hpo> worldwide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its early clinical sign is <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp>, which is not only a predictor for progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> but also an independent risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A few decades ago, diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> was believed to be progressive and irreversible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, the main therapeutic objective for type 2 diabetic patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> was to prevent progression to overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, there is now growing evidence regarding remission/regression of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In recent clinical trials using the renin-angiotensin system blockade drugs, a reduction in <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> by the use of these drugs has been noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also reported that a reduction in <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> was more frequent than progression to overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> and that multifactorial control approach was important to the reduction of <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are similar to those previously reported for type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, our recent study showed that the 8-year cumulative incidence rate of renal and cardiovascular events was significantly lower in patients with remission than in those without it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The annual decline rate of estimated glomerular filtration rate in patients with remission was also significantly slower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These studies provide clinical evidence implying that the reduction of <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> in type 2 diabetic patients occurs frequently and brings about renal and cardiovascular risk reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Reducing <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> is therefore considered to be an important therapeutic objective and may be a biomeasure of therapeutic success in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
