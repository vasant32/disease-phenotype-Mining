<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the plasma levels of enzymes and inhibitors involved in extracellular matrix turnover </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We measured the plasma concentrations of MMP-2, MMP-9, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1) in 80 type-2 diabetic subjects without <z:mp ids='MP_0009644'>uremia</z:mp> and in 80 age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, we determined the plasma levels of intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule 1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule 1 (VCAM-1) and high sensitive(hs) C-reactive protein (CRP) in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Plasma MMP-2, TIMP-1, and hs-CRP concentrations were significantly elevated in diabetic patients as compared to the control subjects (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma levels of MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1, VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and hs-CRP were found not to be significantly associated with age, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, blood pressure, or serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Plasma MMP-2, TIMP-1 and hs-CRP concentrations were significantly increased in type-2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
