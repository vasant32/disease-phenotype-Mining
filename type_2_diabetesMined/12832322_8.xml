<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Myotonic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath> (MyD), the most common adult form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, is often complicated by <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MyD is dominantly inherited and is due to heterozygosity for a trinucleotide repeat expansion mutation in a protein kinase gene able to induce derangement of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> metabolism responsible of an aberrant insulin receptor expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: To assess insulin sensitivity and secretion before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we studied 10 MyD patients, 10 offspring of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (OFF), and 10 healthy subjects with no family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (control subjects) with dual X-ray energy absorption, euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp (40 mU/[m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>min]) combined with infusion of [6,6-D(2)]-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MyD had <z:mp ids='MP_0003961'>reduced lean body mass</z:mp>, but peripheral insulin sensitivity was not different to that of control subjects in contrast to OFF, which showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Insulin secretion, obtained by deconvolution of OGTT data, was also shown to be comparable with that of OFF and control subjects (index of beta-cell function = Phi; P = 0.91) even if increased parameters of insulin secretion were found during the first 30 min (Phi(30); P = 0.05) of the oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fasting plasma proinsulin concentrations (P = 0.01) and the ratio to insulin (P = 0.01) were increased in MyD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The proinsulin levels also failed to be suppressed during the clamp and showed exaggerated response after the OGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increased proinsulin levels were shown to be peculiar of MyD patients when compared with OFF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In nondiabetic, young MyD patients, insulin sensitivity was preserved, and an increased early secretory response to oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Abnormal plasma proinsulin levels in the fasting state, during the clamp, and during the OGTT were shown to be secretory dysfunctions peculiar of MyD patients and may be more important than <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in determining the high risk to develop <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in these patients </plain></SENT>
