<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: In adults, adiponectin is reduced in association with excess <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e>, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed whether adiponectin was 1) present in the fetal circulation, 2) altered in the fetal circulation in the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>maternal diabetes</z:hpo>, and 3) had relations to fetal cord blood insulin or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We assessed adiponectin in cord blood in a large cohort of singleton offspring of diabetic mothers (ODM; n = 134) and control mothers (n = 45) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Adiponectin was present in cord blood and, in ODM, was higher in those delivered at later gestational ages (Spearman r = 0.18, P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adiponectin was slightly lower in ODM than control subjects (ODM 19.7 +/- 6.1 vs. control 21.8 +/- 5.3 micro g/ml; P = 0.04), although this difference could potentially reflect different gestational ages in the two groups (ODM 37.6 +/- 1.5 and control 40.1 +/- 1.1 weeks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast to adults, adiponectin levels in the fetus were unrelated to the degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e>, blood insulin, or leptin in either control subjects or ODM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Adiponectin is present in cord blood but does not show expected physiological relations with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> as observed in adults </plain></SENT>
