<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: In this study, we sought to determine whether postprandial insulin secretion, insulin action, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> effectiveness, and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> turnover were abnormal in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Fourteen subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 11 nondiabetic subjects matched for age, weight, and BMI underwent a mixed-meal test using the triple-tracer technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Indexes of insulin secretion, insulin action, and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> effectiveness were assessed using the oral "minimal" and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fasting and postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations were higher in the diabetic than nondiabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although peak insulin secretion was delayed (P &lt; 0.001) and lower (P &lt; 0.05) in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the integrated total postprandial insulin response did not differ between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Insulin action, insulin secretion, disposition indexes, and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> effectiveness <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were lower (P &lt; 0.05) in diabetic than in nondiabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Whereas the rate of meal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> appearance did not differ between groups, the percent suppression of endogenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production (EGP) was slightly delayed and the increment in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disappearance was substantially lower (P &lt; 0.01) in diabetic subjects during the first 3 h after meal ingestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Together, these defects resulted in an excessive rise in postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations in the diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: When measured using methods that avoid non-steady-state error, the rate of appearance of ingested <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and suppression of EGP was only minimally impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, when considered in light of the prevailing <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration, both were abnormal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, rates of postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disappearance were substantially decreased due to defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> effectiveness </plain></SENT>
