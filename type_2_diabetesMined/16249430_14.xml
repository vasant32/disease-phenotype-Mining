<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To date, the significance of endogenous <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> such as metallothioneins I and II (MT-I+II) in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To examine the MT-I+II-mediated <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> capacity and its response to exercise training in the skeletal muscle of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, biopsies and blood samples were taken from 13 matched subjects (type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> n = 8, control subjects n = 5) both before and after 8 weeks of exercise training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis revealed reduced MT-I+II levels in the skeletal muscle of type 2 diabetic subjects compared with control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Control subjects produced a robust increase of MT-I+II in response to training; however, in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, MT-I+II levels remained essentially unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significantly lower levels of MT-I+II were also detected in the plasma of type 2 diabetic subjects compared with control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that, in control subjects, the MT-I+II defense system is active and inducible within skeletal muscle tissue and plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, reduced levels of MT-I+II in muscle and plasma, as well as the deficient MT-I+II response to exercise, indicate that this <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> defense is impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study presents a novel candidate in the pathogenesis of complications related to <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
