<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity increases in response to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of cellular energy stores, and this enzyme has been implicated in the stimulation of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake into skeletal muscle and the inhibition of liver gluconeogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We recently reported that AMPK is activated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> in cultured rat hepatocytes, mediating the inhibitory effects of the drug on hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we evaluated whether therapeutic doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> increase AMPK activity in vivo in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> treatment for 10 weeks significantly increased AMPK alpha2 activity in the skeletal muscle, and this was associated with increased phosphorylation of AMPK on Thr172 and decreased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15351">acetyl-CoA</z:chebi> carboxylase-2 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The increase in AMPK alpha2 activity was likely due to a change in muscle energy status because ATP and phosphocreatine concentrations were lower after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi>-induced increases in AMPK activity were associated with higher rates of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal and muscle <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the metabolic effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may be mediated by the activation of AMPK alpha2 </plain></SENT>
