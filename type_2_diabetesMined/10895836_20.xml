<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This study is a review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials that included patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> who were randomized to an <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitor</z:chebi> or an alternative drug, were followed for &gt; or =2 years, and had adjudicated cardiovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 4 trials were eligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Appropriate Blood Pressure Control in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> (ABCD) trial (n = 470) compared enalapril with nisoldipine, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3380">Captopril</z:chebi> Prevention Project (CAPPP) (n = 572) compared <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3380">captopril</z:chebi> with <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretics</z:chebi> or beta-blockers, the Fosinopril Versus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2668">Amlodipine</z:chebi> Cardiovascular Events Trial (FACET) (n = 380) compared fosinopril with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2668">amlodipine</z:chebi>, and the U.K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prospective <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study (UKPDS) (n = 758) compared <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3380">captopril</z:chebi> with atenolol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cumulative results of the first 3 trials showed a significant benefit of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitors</z:chebi> compared with alternative treatments on the outcomes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (63% reduction, P &lt; 0.001), cardiovascular events (51% reduction, P &lt; 0.001), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality (62% reduction, P = 0.010) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings were not observed in the UKPDS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitors</z:chebi> did not appear to be superior to other agents for the outcome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in any of the trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the findings were explained by differences in blood pressure control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the alternative agents tested, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitors</z:chebi> may provide a special advantage in addition to blood pressure control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The question of whether atenolol is equivalent to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3380">captopril</z:chebi> remains open </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Conclusive evidence on the comparative effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> treatments will come from large prospective randomized trials </plain></SENT>
