<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to assess the effect of the gene polymorphism of both ACE and ecNOS on renal hemodynamic abnormality, we examined 155 Japanese patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with various stages of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The patients ranged in age from 40 to 72 years (92 men and 63 women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were divided into four groups: group 1 consisted of patients with urinary albumin excretion (UAE) &lt;30 mg/day (n = 69), group 2 had 30 &lt; or = UAE &lt; 300 mg/day (n = 44), group 3 had UAE &gt; or =300 mg/day and serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> &lt;1.5 mg/dl (n = 22), and group 4 had serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> &gt;1.5 mg/dl (n = 20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intrarenal hemodynamics were studied by duplex Doppler sonography in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ACE and ecNOS gene polymorphisms were examined by polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no significant differences in sex, BMI, and blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level, but there were differences in HbA(1c) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> profiles among the four groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the distribution of ACE genotype or in the frequency of the ecNOS 4a allele among the four groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Resistive index (RI) values of the interlobar arteries of group 4 were significantly higher than those of groups 1, 2, and 3, whereas the RI values were not significantly different among groups 1, 2, and 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multiple regression analysis showed that age, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance were significantly associated with the increased RI values, but that there was no significant association between RI values and the ecNOS genotype (R(2) = 0.613, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that intrarenal hemodynamic abnormalities are present as a feature of the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and that they are associated with age, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0005558'>decreased creatinine clearance</z:mp>, and blood pressure, but not with the genetic factors of the ACE and ecNOS gene polymorphism in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
