<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Fitness was determined based on the duration of a maximal graded exercise treadmill test (Balke protocol) at up to three examinations over 20 years from 3,989 black and white men and women from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Relative fitness change (percent) was calculated as the difference between baseline and follow-up treadmill duration/baseline treadmill duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> was identified as fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &gt;or=126 mg/dl, postload <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &gt;or=200 mg/dl, or use of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> developed at a rate of 4 per 1,000 person-years in women (n = 149) and men (n = 122), and lower baseline fitness was associated with a higher incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> race-sex groups (hazard ratios [HRs] from 1.8 to 2.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On average, fitness declined 7.6% in women and 9.2% in men over 7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The likelihood of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> increased per SD decrease (19%) from the 7-year population mean change (-8.3%) in women (HR 1.22 [95% CI 1.09-1.39]) and men (1.45 [1.20-1.75]) after adjustment for age, race, smoking, family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, baseline fitness, BMI, and fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Participants who developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> over 20 years experienced significantly larger declines in relative fitness over 20 years versus those who did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Low fitness is significantly associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence and explained in large part by the relationship between fitness and BMI </plain></SENT>
