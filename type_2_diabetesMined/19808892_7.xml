<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: At least 20 type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> loci have now been identified, and several of these are associated with altered beta-cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have investigated the combined effects of eight known beta-cell loci on insulin secretion stimulated by three different secretagogues during hyperglycemic clamps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 447 subjects originating from four independent studies in the Netherlands and Germany (256 with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance [NGT]/191 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> [IGT]) underwent a hyperglycemic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A subset had an extended clamp with additional glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (GLP)-1 and arginine (n = 224) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We next genotyped single nucleotide polymorphisms in TCF7L2, KCNJ11, CDKAL1, IGF2BP2, HHEX/IDE, CDKN2A/B, SLC30A8, and MTNR1B and calculated a risk allele score by risk allele counting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The risk allele score was associated with lower first-phase <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) (P = 7.1 x 10(-6)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effect size was equal in subjects with NGT and IGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also noted an inverse correlation with the disposition index (P = 1.6 x 10(-3)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When we stratified the study population according to the number of risk alleles into three groups, those with a medium- or high-risk allele score had 9 and 23% lower first-phase GSIS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Second-phase GSIS, insulin sensitivity index and GLP-1, or arginine-stimulated insulin release were not significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A combined risk allele score for eight known beta-cell genes is associated with the rapid first-phase GSIS and the disposition index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The slower second-phase GSIS, GLP-1, and arginine-stimulated insulin secretion are not associated, suggesting that especially processes involved in rapid granule recruitment and exocytosis are affected in the majority of risk loci </plain></SENT>
