<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of the intact biologically active hormones remain largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using newly developed assays for intact glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (GLP)-1 and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent insulinotropic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (GIP), we measured plasma concentrations after a mixed breakfast meal (566 kcal) in 12 type 2 diabetic patients (age 57 years [range 49-67], BMI 31 kg/m2 [27-38], and HbA1c 9.2% [7.0-12.5]) and 12 matched healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients had fasting <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> (10.7 mmol/l [8.0-14.8]) increasing to 14.6 mmol/l (11.5-21.5) 75 min after meal ingestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fasting levels of insulin and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> were similar to those of the healthy subjects, but the postprandial responses were reduced and delayed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fasting levels and meal responses were similar between patients and healthy subjects for total GIP (intact + metabolite) as well as intact GIP, except for a small decrease in the patients at 120 min; integrated areas for intact hormone (area under the curve [AUC]INT) averaged 52 +/- 4% (for patients) versus 56 +/- 3% (for control subjects) of total hormone AUC (AUC(TOT)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AUC(INT) for GLP-1 averaged 48 +/- 2% (for patients) versus 51 +/- 5% (for control subjects) of AUC(TOT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>AUC(TOT) for GLP-1 as well as AUC(INT) tended to be reduced in the patients (P = 0.2 and 0.07, respectively); but the profile of the intact GLP-1 response was characterized by a small early rise (30-45 min) and a significantly reduced late phase (75-150 min) (P &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The measurement of intact incretin hormones revealed that total as well as intact GIP responses were minimally decreased in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, whereas the late intact GLP-1 response was strongly reduced, supporting the hypothesis that an impaired function of GLP-1 as a transmitter in the enteroinsular axis contributes to the inappropriate insulin secretion in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
