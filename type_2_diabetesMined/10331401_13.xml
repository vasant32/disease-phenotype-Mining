<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is not an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> but rather results from both <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and a nonautoimmune insulin secretory defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is, however, a group of phenotypic type 2 diabetic patients who have islet autoantibodies that are similar to those of type 1 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated, using cellular immunoblotting, whether type 2 diabetic patients positive for islet autoantibodies have PBMC responses to islet proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We observed that autoantibody negative (Ab-) type 2 diabetic patients (n = 9) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects (n = 12) demonstrated PBMCs responsive to 0-3 molecular weight regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, autoantibody positive (Ab+) type 2 diabetic patients (n = 11) demonstrated PBMC responses to 3-18 molecular weight regions, similar to that of type 1 diabetic patients (responsive to 4-18 molecular weight regions) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PBMCs from over 90% of the Ab+ type 2 and type 1 diabetic patients were observed to proliferate to islet proteins in the vicinity of 97 kDa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, 65-90% of type 1 diabetic patients had responsive PBMCs for islet proteins in most of the molecular weight regions, whereas &lt;60% of the Ab+ type 2 diabetic patients had PBMCs responsive to the same molecular weight proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ab+ type 2 diabetic patients appear to be <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> with respect to cellular reactivity to islet proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Some subjects demonstrate PBMC responses similar to those of "classic" type 1 diabetic patients, whereas others have PBMC responses potentially distinct from type 1 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
