<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In a previous study, we identified suggestive linkage between type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and a locus on chromosome 9p13-q21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This region contains the gene annexin I (ANXA1), encoding a protein suggested to be involved in both insulin secretion and insulin action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we sequenced the exon/intron boundaries of the human ANXA1 gene and performed mutation screening in 41 individuals from the initial linkage study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We identified five single nucleotide polymorphisms A58G, A401G, intronic variance sequence (IVS)8-28A/G, IVS11 +31A/G, and IVS12-11T/G, which were further tested for association to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in 197 parent/offspring trios using the transmission disequilibrium test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was observed, although the common A allele of the +58A/G variant gave a 22:12 transmission distortion (P = 0.12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This variant was further genotyped in 481 case and control subjects, but no difference in allele, genotype, or haplotype frequencies were observed between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further, a novel polymorphic (CA)(15-25) repeat in intron 11 was genotyped in the subjects included in the initial linkage study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No improvement of the original finding was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We therefore concluded that the ANXA1 gene is unlikely to harbor variants that contribute to risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
