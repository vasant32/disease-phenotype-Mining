<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Type 2 diabetic patients after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> were randomized to an insulin treatment strategy targeting postprandial (PRANDIAL; n = 557) or fasting/interprandial (BASAL; n = 558) <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>GV was calculated as mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE), mean absolute <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (MAG) change, and SD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The PRANDIAL strategy resulted in an 18% lower MAG than BASAL (mean [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>] difference 0.09 [0.04] mmol/L/h, P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, MAGE and SD were lower in the PRANDIAL group, however, not significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HbA(1c) levels and cardiovascular event rates were comparable between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A PRANDIAL strategy demonstrated lower intraday GV vs. a BASAL strategy with similar overall glycemic control but did not result in a reduction in cardiovascular outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This does not support the hypothesis that targeting GV would be beneficial in reducing subsequent secondary cardiovascular events </plain></SENT>
