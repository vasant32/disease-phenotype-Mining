<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nondiabetic first-degree relatives of type 2 diabetic patients have also been reported to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A polygenic basis for pathogenesis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> has been proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A gene expression profile was evaluated in the skeletal muscle of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> while not on treatment for 2 weeks and after 10 days of intensive insulin treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparison of gene expression pattern with age-, sex-, and BMI-matched people with no family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was performed using a microarray technique (Hu6800 arrays; Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only those gene transcripts showing &gt; or =1.9-fold changes and an average difference in fluorescence intensity of &gt; or =1,000 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity (SI) was measured using an intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of 6,451 genes surveyed, transcriptional patterns of 85 genes showed alterations in the diabetic patients after withdrawal of treatment, when compared with patterns in the nondiabetic control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Insulin treatment reduced the difference in patterns between diabetic and nondiabetic control subjects (improved) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but 11 gene transcripts, which included genes involved in structural and contractile functions, growth and tissue development, stress response, and energy metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These improved transcripts included genes involved in insulin signaling, transcription factors, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> maintenance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, insulin treatment altered the transcription of 29 additional genes involved in signal transduction; structural and contractile functions; growth and tissue development; and protein, fat, and energy metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Type 2 diabetic patients had elevated circulating insulin during the insulin-treated phase, although their blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels (98.8 +/- 6.4 vs. 90.0 +/- 2.9 mg/dl for diabetic vs. control) were similar to those of the control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In contrast, after withdrawal of treatment, the diabetic patients had reduced SI and elevated blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (224.0 +/- 26.2 mg/dl), although their insulin levels were similar to those of the nondiabetic control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This study identified several candidate genes for muscle <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, complications associated with poor glycemic control, and effects of insulin treatment in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
