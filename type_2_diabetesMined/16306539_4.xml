<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> affects &gt;60% of people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during the first 2 decades of the disease and is ameliorated by good glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study tested whether intensive <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> case management could prevent or delay diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> in patients with established type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This study was part of a randomized, controlled clinical trial of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> case management in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in southern California counties serving low income ethnic minority populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects were randomized to intervention (<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> case management) or control (traditional treatment) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects with at least two <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> photographs (n = 149) were included in this analysis to assess the effect of intervention on development or progression of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> in the intervention group was not significantly less than in the control group (P = 0.226) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, those in the intervention group with no evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> at baseline were less likely to develop diabetic <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> changes (5/48) during a mean follow-up of 23.1 months than those in the control group (10/34, chi(2) = 4.805, P = 0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This difference remained significant in a logistic regression model that controlled for potential confounders (odds ratio 5.35 [95% CI 1.14-25.12]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that a relatively short duration of case management instituted before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of clinically identifiable <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> significantly diminished the risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The findings also emphasized the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> disease burden in this population, with development and progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> occurring in &lt;2 years </plain></SENT>
