<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The program involved group-education 2 h a week for 14 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whereas one group received the program, the other acted as a control group and received the program later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HbA(1c) was measured and subjects filled out a mood adjective checklist before the start of intervention and both 1 month and 1 year after completing it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In both groups, significant positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001575'>mood changes</z:hpo> were obtained, but no significant changes in HbA(1c) values occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant relationship was found between measures of change in HbA(1c) and of changes in mood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For those attending the group-sessions less frequently, the HbA(1c) values were significantly worse on each of the three measurement occasions than the values of those attending more frequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The effectiveness of the program, with its failure to improve glycemic control but enhancing the mood of participants, is discussed in terms of characteristics of the sample and various methodological issues as well as in comparison with results of similar studies involving Type 1 and Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
