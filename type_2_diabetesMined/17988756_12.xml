<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-five patients were randomly assigned to an intervention group and twenty-six to a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The intervention was applied for 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The goal of the intervention was to keep blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations close to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range (HbA(1)c&lt;7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients in the intervention group were asked to access a website by using a cellular phone or to wiring the Internet and input their blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels weekly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Participants were sent the optimal recommendations by both cellular phone and the Internet weekly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Participants in the intervention group had lower HbA(1)c over 12 months when compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 12 months the change from baseline in HbA(1)c was -1.32 in the intervention group versus +0.81 in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two hours post-meal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (2HPMG) had a significantly greater decline in the intervention group after 12 months when compared with the control group (-100.0 versus +18.1mg/dl) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This educational intervention using the Internet and a SMS by cellular phone rapidly improved and stably maintained the glycemic control of the patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
