<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Study 1 was a 12-week, multicentre, randomized, double blind and placebo-controlled study of nateglinide monotherapy (120 mg, before meals) in 66 drug-naïve patients with T2DM aged &gt;or=65 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Study 2 was a 104-week, multicentre, randomized, double blind and active-controlled study of nateglinide (120 mg, before meals) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi> (up to 5 mg bid) in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (up to 1000 mg bid) in 69 treatment-naïve patients with T2DM aged &gt;or=65 years </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In Study 1, nateglinide significantly reduced HbA(1c) from baseline (7.6 +/- 0.1% to 6.9 +/- 0.1%; Delta = -0.7 +/- 0.1%, p &lt; 0.001) and compared with placebo (between-group difference = -0.5%, p = 0.004 vs. nateglinide) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> was reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In Study 2, combination therapy with nateglinide/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> significantly reduced HbA(1c) from baseline (7.8 +/- 0.2% to 6.6 +/- 0.1%; Delta = -1.2 +/- 0.2%, p &lt; 0.001), as did <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (7.7 +/- 0.1% to 6.5 +/- 0.1%; Delta = -1.2 +/- 0.1%, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no difference between treatments (p = 0.310) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One nateglinide/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>-treated patient experienced a mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0745153" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemic episode</z:e> compared with eight episodes in eight patients on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>; one severe episode led to discontinuation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Target HbA(1c) (&lt;7.0%) was achieved by 60% of patients receiving nateglinide (Study 1) and 70% of nateglinide/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>-treated patients (Study 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Initial drug treatment with nateglinide, alone or in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, is well tolerated and produces clinically meaningful improvements in glycaemic control in elderly patients with T2DM </plain></SENT>
