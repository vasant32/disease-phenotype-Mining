<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore used oligonucleotide arrays to define global alterations in gene expression in MIN6 cells after 48-h pretreatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30823">oleate</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Altogether, 126 genes were altered &gt; or =1.9-fold by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi>, 62 by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30823">oleate</z:chebi>, and 46 by both <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Importantly, nine of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi>-regulated genes are known to be correspondingly changed in models of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A tendency toward beta-cell de-differentiation was also apparent with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi>: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> carboxylase and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> 3-phosphate dehydrogenase were downregulated, whereas <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28757">fructose</z:chebi> 1,6-bisphosphatases were induced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increases in the latter (also seen with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30823">oleate</z:chebi>), along with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24269">glucosamine-phosphate</z:chebi> N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi> transferase, imply upregulation of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24586">hexosamine</z:chebi> biosynthesis pathway in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi>-treated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> also increased expression of calcyclin and 25-kDa synaptosomal-associated protein (SNAP25), which control distal secretory processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Consistent with these findings, secretory responses to noncarbohydrate stimuli, especially <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> itself, were upregulated in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi>-treated cells (much less so with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30823">oleate</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Indeed, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated secretion was slightly sensitized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> exposure but inhibited by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30823">oleate</z:chebi> treatment, whereas both <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> enhanced basal secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="30823">Oleate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> also induced expression of chemokines (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 and GRO1 oncogene) and genes of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase response (serum amyloid A3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Increases in transcriptional modulators such as ATF3, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-beta (C/EBPbeta), C/EBPdelta, and c-fos were also seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results highlight links between regulated gene expression and phenotypic alterations in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> versus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30823">oleate</z:chebi>-pretreated beta-cells </plain></SENT>
