<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">Glycogen</z:chebi> synthesis and the activity of the enzyme <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase (GS) have been studied in human myoblasts in culture under a variety of experimental conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Incubation in the absence of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> for up to 6 h caused an approximately 50% decrease in <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> content, which was associated with a small decrease in the fractional activity of GS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subsequent reincubation with physiological concentrations of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> led to a dramatic increase in the rate of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthesis and in the fractional activity of GS, an effect which was both time- and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration-dependent and essentially additive with the effects of insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This effect was seen only after <z:mpath ids='MPATH_50'>glycogen depletion</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inhibitors of signaling pathways involved in the stimulation of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthesis by insulin were without significant effect on the stimulatory action of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that at least two distinct mechanisms exist to stimulate <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthesis in human muscle: one acting in response to insulin and the other acting in response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> after <z:mpath ids='MPATH_50'>glycogen depletion</z:mpath>, such as that which results from exercise or starvation </plain></SENT>
