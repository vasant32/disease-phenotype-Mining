<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi>-treated patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (N = 69) were randomized to exenatide or insulin glargine and treated for 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Body composition was evaluated by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, body weight, waist circumference, and cardiovascular biomarkers were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treatment with exenatide for 1 year significantly <z:mp ids='MP_0001262'>reduced body weight</z:mp>, waist circumference, and total body and trunkal fat mass by 6, 5, 11, and 13%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, exenatide increased total adiponectin by 12% and reduced high-sensitivity C-reactive protein by 61% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Insulin glargine significantly reduced endothelin-1 by 7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These changes were statistically independent of the change in total body fat mass and body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Exenatide treatment for 1 year reduced body fat mass and improved the profile of circulating biomarkers of cardiovascular risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant changes were seen with insulin glargine except a trend for reduced endothelin-1 levels </plain></SENT>
