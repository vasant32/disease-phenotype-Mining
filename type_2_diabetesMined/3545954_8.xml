<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their HLA frequencies were compared with those of Type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetic patients and of healthy blood donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Type 1 diabetic patients showed a typical HLA pattern, with increased frequencies of B15, DR3, DR4, B8/B15 and DR3/DR4 and decreased frequencies of B7 and DR2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Type 2 diabetic patients could be distinguished from blood donors by increased frequencies of Cw4, DR4, DR5 and DR3/DR4, and from Type 1 diabetic patients by increased frequencies of B7, DR2, DR5 and decreased frequency of A9, Bw22 and DR4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and body mass index were unrelated to HLA antigens, but the Type 2 diabetic patients with HLA-Cw4, DR5 and DR6 showed a strong family history for Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Type 2 diabetic patients with HLA-B8, DR4, B8/B15 and DR3/DR4 showed significantly lower C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> concentrations (p less than 0.05) than patients without these HLA antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, patients with DR5 and DRw8 presented with high C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients who were positive for both DR3 and DR4 and 23 patients who were DR3/DR4 negative were followed with repeated C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> determinations during a period of three years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> concentrations of the DR3/DR4 positive patients decreased during this period, whereas there was no change in C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels in the DR3/DR4 negative patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
