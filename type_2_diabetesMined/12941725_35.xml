<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Compare the efficacy, safety, and patient satisfaction of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) therapy with multiple daily injection (<z:chebi fb="5" ids="53218">MDI</z:chebi>) therapy for patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 132 CSII-naive type 2 diabetic patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to CSII (using insulin aspart) or <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53218">MDI</z:chebi> therapy (bolus insulin aspart and basal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin) in a multicenter, open-label, randomized, parallel-group, 24-week study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Efficacy was assessed with HbA(1c) and eight-point blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (BG) profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment satisfaction was determined with a self-administered questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Safety assessments included adverse events, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001988'>hypoglycemic episodes</z:hpo>, laboratory values, and physical examination findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HbA(1c) values decreased similarly for both groups from baseline (8.2 +/- 1.37% for CSII, 8.0 +/- 1.08% for <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53218">MDI</z:chebi>) to end of study (7.6 +/- 1.22% for CSII, 7.5 +/- 1.22% for <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53218">MDI</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The CSII group showed a trend toward lower eight-point BG values at most time points (only significant 90 min after breakfast; 167 +/- 48 vs. 192 +/- 65 mg/dl for CSII and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53218">MDI</z:chebi>, respectively; P = 0.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 93% of CSII-treated subjects preferred the pump to their previous injectable insulin regimen for reasons of convenience, flexibility, ease of use, and overall preference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Safety assessments were comparable for both treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Insulin aspart in CSII therapy provided efficacy and safety comparable to <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53218">MDI</z:chebi> therapy for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> can be trained as outpatients to use CSII and prefer CSII to injections, indicating that pump therapy should be considered when initiating intensive insulin therapy for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
