<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine whether ginseng or ginsenoside Re improves β-cell function and insulin sensitivity (IS) in insulin-resistant subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Overweight or <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects (BMI = 34 ± 1 kg/m²) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> or newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were randomized to 30 days of treatment with ginseng root extract (8 g/day), ginsenoside Re (250-500 mg/day), or placebo. β-Cell function was assessed as the disposition index (DI) and measured by a frequently sampled oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test, and IS was assessed as the relative increase in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal during a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp procedure plus stable isotope tracer infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Values for DI and IS after therapy (Post) were not different from values before therapy (Pre) in the placebo (DI: Pre, 5.8 ± 0.9 × 10⁻³ and Post, 5.8 ± 0.8 × 10⁻³, P = 0.99; IS: Pre,165 ± 29% and Post, 185 ± 24%, P = 0.34), ginseng (DI: Pre, 7.7 ± 2.0 × 10⁻³ and Post, 6.0 ± 0.8 × 10⁻³, P = 0.29; IS: Pre, 171 ± 72% and Post,137 ± 59%, P = 0.88), and ginsenoside Re (DI: Pre, 7.4 ± 3.0 × 10⁻³ and Post, 5.9 ± 1.1 × 10⁻³, P = 0.50; IS: Pre, 117 ± 31% and Post, 134 ± 34%, P = 0.44) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ginsenosides Re, Rb₁, and Rb₂ were not detectable in plasma after treatment with ginseng root extract or ginsenoside Re </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Oral ginseng or ginsenoside Re therapy does not improve β-cell function or IS in overweight/<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> or newly diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Poor systemic bioavailability might be responsible for the absence of a therapeutic effect </plain></SENT>
