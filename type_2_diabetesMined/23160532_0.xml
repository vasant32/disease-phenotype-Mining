<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To test the predictivity of α-HB and L-GPC for incident dysglycemia, α-HB and L-GPC measurements were obtained in two observational cohorts, comprising 1,261 nondiabetic participants from the Relationship between Insulin Sensitivity and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">Cardiovascular Disease</z:e> (RISC) study and 2,580 from the Botnia Prospective Study, with 3-year and 9.5-year follow-up data, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In both cohorts, α-HB was a positive correlate and L-GPC a negative correlate of insulin sensitivity, with α-HB reciprocally related to indices of β-cell function derived from the oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In follow-up, α-HB was a positive predictor (adjusted odds ratios 1.25 [95% CI 1.00-1.60] and 1.26 [1.07-1.48], respectively, for each standard deviation of predictor), and L-GPC was a negative predictor (0.64 [0.48-0.85] and 0.67 [0.54-0.84]) of dysglycemia (RISC) or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (Botnia), independent of familial <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, sex, age, BMI, and fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Corresponding area under the receiver operating characteristic curves were 0.791 (RISC) and 0.783 (Botnia), similar in accuracy when substituting α-HB and L-GPC with 2-h OGTT <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When their activity was examined, α-HB inhibited and L-GPC stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced insulin release in INS-1e cells. α-HB and L-GPC are independent predictors of worsening <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, physiologically consistent with a joint signature of IR and β-cell dysfunction </plain></SENT>
