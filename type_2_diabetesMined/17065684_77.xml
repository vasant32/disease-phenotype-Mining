<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="50211">Retinol</z:chebi>-binding protein-4 (RBP4), a new adipokine, was recently reported to provide a link between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we examined the relation between plasma RBP4 concentrations and various metabolic parameters in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was developed to measure human RBP4 plasma concentrations, which were then compared with various parameters related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (NGT; n = 57), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT; n = 48), and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 49) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Plasma RBP4 concentrations were higher in the IGT and type 2 diabetic groups than in the NGT group (median 18.9 [range 11.2-45.8], 20.9 [9.9-48.5], and 18.1 microg/ml [9.3-30.5], respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, no difference was found between plasma RBP4 concentrations in the IGT and type 2 diabetic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma RBP4 concentrations were found to be associated with sex, waist circumference, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of these, sex and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were found to be independent determinants of plasma RBP4 concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Plasma RBP4 concentrations were found to be elevated in subjects with IGT or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and to be related to various clinical parameters known to be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
