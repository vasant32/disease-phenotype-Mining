<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">Melatonin</z:chebi> contributes to the regulation of sleep, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0851578,C0700201" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sleep problems</z:e> are a documented risk factor for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate whether the MTNR1B gene variant rs10830963 is associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0851578,C0700201" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sleep problems</z:e> and whether this variant contributes to the association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002360'>sleep disturbances</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a case-control study nested within the population-based Nord-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Tr</z:e>Ã¸ndelag Health Study, including 1,322 prevalent cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 1,447 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, prospective data were available for 838 incident cases and 1,133 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genotyping was done by TaqMan single-nucleotide polymorphism allelic discrimination analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ORs and 95% CIs were calculated using logistic regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our findings confirm an association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002360'>sleep disturbances</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.22-2.33, p = 0.0016) and between the risk allele of rs10830963 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.00-1.27, p = 0.0579) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a tendency for an association between the risk allele and prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0851578,C0700201" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sleep problems</z:e> (specifically early awakening) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the risk allele did not influence the association of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0851578,C0700201" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sleep problems</z:e> with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, which was unaltered after adjustment for the MTNR1B risk allele (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.23-2.34, p = 0.0014) </plain></SENT>
