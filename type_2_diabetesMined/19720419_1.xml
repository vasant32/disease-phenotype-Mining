<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Baseline data was analyzed from individuals enrolled in a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention program (n=56) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Si was calculated using the whole-body insulin sensitivity method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Centers for Epidemiologic Studies <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Scale (CESD) was used to assess depressive symptoms and depressed cases were identified using a cutoff of &gt;or=16 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> treatment was identified using a self-report form validated by medical chart review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The PA subscale of the Health Promoting Lifestyle Profile was used to determine PA levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One third of participants had elevated depressive symptoms; 19% were taking antidepressant medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean Si was 3.1 (+/-1.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In ANOVA, depressed individuals showed significantly lower Si (M=1.8+/-0.9) than non-depressed individuals (M=3.4+/-1.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, individuals taking antidepressant medications had Si similar to non-depressed individuals (M=3.7+/-2.3: p=.63) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In ANCOVA this association remained after controlling for PA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that in adults at high risk for T2DM, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> treatment may improve <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Healthcare practitioners are encouraged to screen, treat, or refer their patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> for treatment </plain></SENT>
