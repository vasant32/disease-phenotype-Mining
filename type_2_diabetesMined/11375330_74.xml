<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ATP is particularly important, given its role in regulating <z:chebi fb="36" ids="36916">cation</z:chebi> channel activity, exocytosis, and events dependent upon its hydrolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Uncoupling protein (UCP)-2 is proposed to catalyze a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> inner-membrane <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15378">H(+)</z:chebi> leak that bypasses ATP synthase, thereby reducing cellular ATP content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Previously, we showed that overexpression of UCP-2 suppressed <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in isolated islets (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to identify downstream consequences of UCP-2 overexpression and to determine whether insufficient insulin secretion in a diabetic model was correlated with increased endogenous UCP-2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In isolated islets from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rats, the degree to which GSIS was suppressed was inversely correlated with the amount of UCP-2 expression induced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Depolarizing the islets with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi> or inhibiting ATP-dependent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> (K(ATP)) channels with glybenclamide elicited similar insulin secretion in control and UCP-2-overexpressing islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane ((m)) hyperpolarization was reduced in beta-cells overexpressing UCP-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ATP content of UCP-2-induced islets was reduced by 50%, and there was no change in the efflux of Rb(+) at high versus low <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations, suggesting that low ATP led to reduced <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced depolarization, thereby causing <z:mp ids='MP_0003059'>reduced insulin secretion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sprague-Dawley rats fed a diet with 40% fat for 3 weeks were <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> intolerant, and in vitro insulin secretion at high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was only increased 8.5-fold over basal, compared with 28-fold in control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Islet UCP-2 mRNA expression was increased twofold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These studies provide further strong evidence that UCP-2 is an important negative regulator of beta-cell insulin secretion and demonstrate that reduced (m) and increased activity of K(ATP) channels are mechanisms by which UCP-2-mediated effects are mediated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These studies also raise the possibility that a pathological upregulation of UCP-2 expression in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetic state</z:e> could contribute to the loss of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> responsiveness observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-related type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in humans </plain></SENT>
