<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study addressed the relationship between leptin receptor gene variations and type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of LEPR gene, Arg109Lys (A/G), Asn656Lys (C/G) and Pro1019Pro (C/T) were detected in a northern population in China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Totally, 317 patients with T2DM and 282 healthy controls were recruited randomly from urban communities in Harbin area in the Northeast of China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> polymorphisms were genotyped by Sequenom SNP detection system in both case and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Linkage disequilibria analysis showed moderate linkage disequilibria between the pair-wise SNPs for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three SNPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Then, we identified the haplotype covering the three SNPs (AGC) with higher risk of T2DM (OR=1.69 (1.09-2.61)), and showed that there existed significant difference between cases and controls (9.8% vs. 6.0%, P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also observed significant difference in frequencies of the heterozygous haplotype combination (GGT/AGC), that is 17.0% vs. 8.2% in cases and controls, respectively (P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It further supported the evidence that the haplotype (AGC) was associated with T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>So, AGC haplotype in LEPR gene could be a risk factor associated with T2DM in Northern Chinese </plain></SENT>
