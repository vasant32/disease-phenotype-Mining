<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used a candidate gene-based approach to identify single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variants in 222 candidate genes that influence susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a case-control study of 1,161 type 2 diabetic subjects and 1,174 control Finns who are <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerant, we genotyped 3,531 tagSNPs and annotation-based SNPs and imputed an additional 7,498 SNPs, providing 99.9% coverage of common HapMap variants in the 222 candidate genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Selected SNPs were genotyped in an additional 1,211 type 2 diabetic case subjects and 1,259 control subjects who are <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerant, also from Finland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Using SNP- and gene-based analysis methods, we replicated previously reported SNP-type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> associations in PPARG, KCNJ11, and SLC2A2; identified significant SNPs in genes with previously reported associations (ENPP1 [rs2021966, P = 0.00026] and NRF1 [rs1882095, P = 0.00096]); and implicated novel genes, including RAPGEF1 (rs4740283, P = 0.00013) and TP53 (rs1042522, Arg72Pro, P = 0.00086), in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides an effective gene-based approach to association study design and analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One or more of the newly implicated genes may contribute to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis of additional samples will be necessary to determine their effect on susceptibility </plain></SENT>
