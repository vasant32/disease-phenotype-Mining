<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of a 4-week adjunctive therapy of exenatide (EXE) (5-10 microg b.i.d.) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> (SITA) (100 mg once daily) in response to a standardized breakfast meal challenge in 48 men or women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> receiving insulin glargine (GLAR) + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (MET) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a single-center, randomized, open-label, active comparator-controlled study with a three-arm parallel group design, consisting of: screening, 4- to 8-week run-in period, 4-week treatment period, and follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three groups, the GLAR dose was titrated according to an algorithm (fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &lt;or=100 mg/dl) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The unadjusted 6-h postprandial blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excursion of both GLAR + MET + EXE and GLAR + MET + SITA was statistically significantly smaller than that of GLAR + MET (606 +/- 104 vs. 612 +/- 133 vs. 728 +/- 132 mg/dl/h; P = 0.0036 and 0.0008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A1C significantly decreased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three groups (P &lt; 0.0001), with the greatest reduction of -1.9 +/- 0.7 under GLAR + MET + EXE (GLAR + MET + SITA -1.5 +/- 0.7; GLAR + MET -1.2 +/- 0.5%-points; GLAR + MET + EXE vs. GLAR + MET P = 0.0154) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association A1C target of &lt;7.0% was reached by 80.0, 87.5, and 62.5% of subjects, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>GLAR + MET + EXE had the highest number (47) of adverse events, mostly gastrointestinal (56%) with one dropout </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>GLAR + MET or GLAR + MET + SITA only had 10 and 12 adverse events, respectively, and no dropouts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>Hypoglycemia</z:hpo> (blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &lt;50 mg/dl) rates were low and comparable among groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Weight decreased with GLAR + MET + EXE (-0.9 +/- 1.7 kg; P = 0.0396) and increased slightly with GLAR + MET (0.4 +/- 1.5 kg; NS; GLAR + MET + EXE vs. GLAR + MET P = 0.0377) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: EXE or SITA added to GLAR + MET further substantially reduced postprandial blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excursions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Longer-term studies in a larger population are warranted to confirm these findings </plain></SENT>
