<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we examined whether that finding was associated with an improvement in disposition index, an index of beta cell function defined as the product of insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since this is a report of secondary analysis on a previously published trial, the results should be considered as hypothesis-generating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Type 2 diabetic patients treated by diet alone (n = 162) were randomised by computer to high-carbohydrate/high-glycaemic index (High-GI, n = 52), high-carbohydrate/low-glycaemic index (Low-GI, n = 56) or low-carbohydrate/high-monounsaturated-fat (Low-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi>, n = 54) diets for 1 year in a multi-centre, parallel-design clinical trial conducted at University teaching hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At baseline and at 3, 6 and 12 months participants underwent 75 g OGTTs; 27 participants dropped out or were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Indices of insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion and disposition index, derived from the OGTT, were compared among diets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Those assessing the outcomes were blinded to group assignment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Neither muscle insulin sensitivity index nor insulinogenic index differed significantly among diets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, a significant time x diet interaction existed for disposition index (muscle insulin sensitivity index x insulinogenic index) (p = 0.036) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After 3 months, disposition index tended to be higher on Low-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi> than on Low-GI diets, namely by 0.07 h(-1) (95% CI -0.04, 0.18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, by 12 months this reversed and disposition index became higher on Low-GI than on Low-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi>, namely by 0.12 h(-1) (0.01, 0.23; p &lt; 0.05, baseline disposition index 0.23 h(-1)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no important adverse effects associated with the treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These results suggest that, in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on diet alone, a Low-GI diet for 1 year increases disposition index, an index of beta cell function, compared with a Low-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi> diet </plain></SENT>
