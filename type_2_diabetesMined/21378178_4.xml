<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) regulatory subunit-associated protein 1-like 1 has recently been linked to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by genome-wide association studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While CDK5 and its regulatory protein p35 are both expressed and display enzymatic activity in pancreatic β-cells, their precise role in the β-cell remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is characterized by a deficit in β-cell mass and increased β-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, we investigated the role of CDK5 in β-cell survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used INS 832/13 cells, rat islets isolated from <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> or human islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (h-IAPP) transgenic rats, and pancreatic tissue from rats and humans with and without type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and investigated the effect of CDK5/p35 inhibition (by small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> or by chemical inhibition) as well as CDK5/p35 overexpression on β-cell vulnerability to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CDK5 inhibition led to increased β-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To identify the mechanisms involved, we examined the phosphorylation state of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> kinase (Fak)(Ser732), a known target of CDK5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Following CDK5 inhibition, the phosphorylation of Fak(Ser732) decreased with resulting attenuation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt survival pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conversely, CDK5 overexpression increased Fak(Ser732) phosphorylation and protected β-cells against <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by the inhibition of the β-1 integrin signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Also, Fak(Ser732) phosphorylation was less abundant in β-cells in both h-IAPP transgenic rats and humans with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that by regulating Fak phosphorylation and subsequently PI3K/Akt survival pathway, CDK5 plays a previously unrecognized role in promoting β-cell survival </plain></SENT>
