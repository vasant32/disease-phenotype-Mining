<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the prospective associations of baseline <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> [25-hydroxyvitamin D; 25(OH)D] with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (IR), β-cell function, and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis in subjects at risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We followed 489 subjects, aged 50 ± 10 years, for 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At baseline and follow-up, 75-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests (OGTTs) were administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IR was measured using the Matsuda index (IS(OGTT)) and the homeostasis model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR), β-cell function was determined using both the insulinogenic index divided by HOMA-IR (IGI/IR) and the insulin secretion sensitivity index-2 (ISSI-2), and glycemia was assessed using the area under the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> curve (AUC(<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regression models were adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, season, and baseline value of the outcome variable, as well as baseline and change in physical activity, <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> supplement use, and BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Multivariate linear regression analyses indicated no significant association of baseline 25(OH)D with follow-up IS(OGTT) or HOMA-IR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were, however, significant positive associations of baseline 25(OH)D with follow-up IGI/IR (β = 0.005, P = 0.015) and ISSI-2 (β = 0.002, P = 0.023) and a significant inverse association of baseline 25(OH)D with follow-up AUC(<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>) (β = -0.001, P = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Progression to dysglycemia (impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo>, or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) occurred in 116 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analyses indicated a significant reduced risk of progression with higher baseline 25(OH)D (adjusted odds ratio 0.69 [95% CI 0.53-0.89]), but this association was not significant after additional adjustment for baseline and change in BMI (0.78 [0.59-1.02]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Higher baseline 25(OH)D independently predicted better β-cell function and lower AUC(<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>) at follow-up, supporting a potential role for <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> etiology </plain></SENT>
