<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13705">acetoacetate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37054">3-hydroxybutyrate</z:chebi> and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37054">3-hydroxybutyrate</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="13705">acetoacetate</z:chebi> ratio were determined in Type 1 (insulin-dependent) and Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetic patients by a new sensitive method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Efforts were made to differentiate Type 1 and Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by serum levels of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17087">ketone</z:chebi> bodies and to determine whether their measurement is a useful way of monitoring diabetic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, serum levels of total <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17087">ketone</z:chebi> bodies did not exceed 2.0 mmol/l even if the patients were untreated or poorly controlled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In Type 1 diabetic subjects, treated with once or twice daily injections of insulin, morning serum levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13705">acetoacetate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37054">3-hydroxybutyrate</z:chebi> and total <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17087">ketone</z:chebi> bodies were significantly elevated by four-, ten- and sevenfold, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In Type 2 diabetic subjects treated with diet or sulphonylureas, serum levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37054">3-hydroxybutyrate</z:chebi> were highest before breakfast, next highest before dinner and decreased after each meal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The changes were roughly inversely proportional to serum insulin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, insulin treatment normalized fasting serum levels of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17087">ketone</z:chebi> bodies better than diet or sulphonylurea treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="13705">Acetoacetate</z:chebi> was also significantly increased in both types of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> to a lesser extent, but no apparent diurnal rhythm was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Determination of serum levels of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17087">ketone</z:chebi> bodies is useful for the diagnosis of Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (those with total <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17087">ketone</z:chebi> bodies greater than 2 mmol/l) and for detecting insufficient insulin therapy </plain></SENT>
