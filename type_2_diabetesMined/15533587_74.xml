<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This was a 22-week, multinational, open-labelled, symmetrically randomised, parallel group trial including 395 people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (IDet + IAsp: 195, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> + HSI: 200) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At 22 weeks, HbA1c was comparable between treatments (IDet + IAsp: 7.46%, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> + HSI: 7.52%, P = 0.515) with decreases from baseline of 0.65% and 0.58%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment with IDet + IAsp was associated with a significantly lower within-person variation in self-measured fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) (SD:1.20 versus 1.54 mmol/L, p &lt; 0.001), as well as a lower body <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> (0.51 versus 1.13 kg, p = 0.038) than with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> + HSI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The risk of nocturnal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> was 38% lower with IDet + IAsp than with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> + HSI, but statistical significance was not attained (P = 0.14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall safety profile was similar between the two treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Basal-bolus treatment with IDet + IAsp is an effective and well tolerated insulin regimen in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, resulting in glycaemic control comparable to that of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> + HSI, but with the advantages of less <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> and a lower day-to-day within-person variation in FPG </plain></SENT>
