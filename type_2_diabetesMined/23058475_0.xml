<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Immigrants and non-immigrants with T2DM were compared in the nationally representative 2005 and 2007 Canadian Community Health Surveys (N = 7658 representing 1,205,000 in 2005; N = 3605 representing 1,446,000 in 2007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No significant differences existed between immigrants and non-immigrants with T2DM in annual glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> testing, foot examination by a physician, urine protein testing, or eye examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among self-care measures, immigrants were less likely to perform foot self-examination at least weekly (OR = 0.70 [0.50, 0.98] in 2005; OR = 0.65 [0.47, 0.91] in 2007) or smoke (OR = 0.63 [0.45, 0.87] in 2005; OR = 0.44 [0.25, 0.77] in 2007), but there were no differences in self-monitoring of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> or physical inactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With respect to health status, immigrants were less likely to have a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> condition in addition to T2DM (OR = 0.68 [0.54, 0.86] in 2005; OR = 0.59 [0.41, 0.84] in 2007), but there were no differences in self-perceived general or mental health </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare, self-care, and health status were similar in immigrants and non-immigrants with T2DM in Canada; however, immigrants were less likely to regularly examine their feet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Culturally appropriate footcare education should be considered to prevent lower limb complications </plain></SENT>
