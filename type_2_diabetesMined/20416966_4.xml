<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Subjects consisted of 170 type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> patients not showing diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> on their first visit to our hospital between 1966 and 1979, and continuously visited thereafter for 27-40 (mean, 33) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and HbA1c data obtained on every hospital visit were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As FPG variability parameter, standard deviations (SD) were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The investigation in which patients were classified based on the median value of the mean HbA1c or FPG and that of FPG SD have revealed that the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> development and progression were similar between the group showing good control and high variability and that with poor control and low variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis models with the mean FPG or HbA1c as a covariate and models using the mean FPG or HbA1c as a time-dependent covariate after adjustment for age, sex, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration, BMI, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>, FPG SD was a significant independent risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In type 2 diabetic patients, FPG variability is a risk factor for diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> independent of the mean FPG or HbA1c </plain></SENT>
