<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To implement an educational program in 10 Latin American countries and to evaluate its effect on the clinical, biochemical, and therapeutic aspects as well as the economic cost of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Educators from each participating country were previously trained to implement the educational model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient population included 446 individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were &lt;65 years of age, did not require insulin for metabolic control, did not have severe complications of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or life-limiting illnesses, and had not previously participated in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> education courses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical and therapeutic data and the cost of their pharmacological treatment were collected 6 months before participation in the educational program (-6 months), on entry into the program (time 0), and at 4, 8, and 12 months after initiation of the program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> parameters measured had improved significantly (P &lt; 0.001) by 1 year: fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (mean +/- SD) 10.6 +/- 3.5 vs. 8.7 +/- 3.0 mmol/l; HbA(1c) 9.0 +/- 2.0 vs. 7.8 +/- 1.6%; body weight 84.6 +/- 14.7 vs. 81.2 +/- 15.2 kg; systolic blood pressure 149.6 +/- 33.6 vs. 142.9 +/- 18.8 mmHg; total cholesterol 6.1 +/- 1.1 vs. 5.4 +/- 1.0 mmol/l; and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> 2.7 +/- 1.8 vs. 2.1 +/- 1.2 mmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 12 months, the decrease in pharmacotherapy required for control of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> represented a 62% decrease in the annual cost of treatment ($107,939.99 vs. $41,106.30 [U.S.]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After deducting the additional cost of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003076'>glucosuria</z:hpo> monitoring ($30,604), there was still a 34% annual savings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The beneficial results of this educational model, implemented in 10 Latin American countries, reinforce the value of patient education as an essential part of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They also suggest that an educational approach promoting healthy lifestyle habits and patient empowerment is an effective strategy with the potential to decrease the development of complications related to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> as well as the socioeconomic costs of the disease </plain></SENT>
