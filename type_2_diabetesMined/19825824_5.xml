<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We explored ethnicity-specific relationships between <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> and calcified plaque involving the infrarenal aorta, coronary artery, and carotid artery in 835 European American and 393 African American subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Generalized estimating equations with exchangeable correlation and the sandwich estimator of the variance were used to test for association between the principal component of calcified plaque in the three vascular beds and urine albumin-to-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio (ACR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean +/- SD ages of African American and European American participants were 56.7 +/- 9.6 and 61.7 +/- 9.1 years, respectively, with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration of 10.4 +/- 7.4 and 10.0 +/- 7.3 years and median urine ACR of 17.5 and 13.4 mg/g </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In African American and European American participants, respectively, median calcified plaque mass scores were 53.5 and 291 for coronary artery, 3 and 35.5 for carotid artery, and 761 and 3,237 for aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With adjustment for age, sex, glomerular filtration rate, and BMI, <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> was significantly associated with calcified plaque in European Americans (P = 3.4 x 10(-8)) but not in African Americans (P = 0.33), with significant ethnic interaction (P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ethnic differences in this relationship persisted after adjustment for blood pressure, smoking, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, and use of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitors</z:chebi> or angiotensin receptor blockers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>Albuminuria</z:mp> is strongly associated with severity of calcified plaque in European Americans with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> but not in African Americans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Disparities in this relationship may contribute to ethnic differences in the rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> that are observed in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
