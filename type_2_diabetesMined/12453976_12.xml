<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the distribution of the age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0004904'>maturity-onset diabetes of the young</z:hpo>-3 [MODY3]) and to identify determinants of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in carriers of HNF-1alpha mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Extended families (n = 104) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> inherited in a dominant pattern were recruited and screened for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-causing mutations in HNF-1alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HNF-1alpha mutations cosegregated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in only 13 families, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with a mean age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> &lt;35 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Insulin secretion was diminished or absent in mutation carriers (n = 101), and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> developed in 65% by age 25 years and in 100% by age 50 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>If the mutation was inherited from the mother, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was very young in those exposed to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in utero; 57 +/- 8% were affected by age 15 years as compared with 0.0% in those not exposed (P &lt; 7 x 10(-6)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By age 25 years, the difference was reduced (85 +/- 6 and 55 +/- 12%, respectively; P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>If the mutation was inherited from the father, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> developed in 52 +/- 8% by age 25 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Age at diagnosis was shown to be highly heritable (h(2) = 0.47, P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When parent of origin was included in the analyses, the magnitude of genetic contribution increased markedly (h(2) = 0.91) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in HNF-1alpha accounts for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a small proportion of families with a dominant pattern of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in MODY3 families varied widely and was influenced by familial factors (including modifying genes) and parent of origin (whether a mutation carrier was exposed to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in utero) </plain></SENT>
