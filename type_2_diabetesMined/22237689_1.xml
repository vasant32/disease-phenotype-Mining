<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and health outcomes in a population invited for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> screening at 5-yearly intervals from 1990 (screened population) with those in a similar population not invited for screening (unscreened population) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a parallel-group, cohort study of people aged 40-65 years, free of known <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, identified from the population register of a general practice in Ely, Cambridgeshire, UK (n = 4,936) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 1990-1992, one-third (n = 1,705), selected randomly, received an invitation for screening for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> at 5-yearly intervals (screened population) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From the remainder of the sampling frame, 1,705 randomly selected individuals were invited to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> screening 10 years later (unscreened population) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from both populations were invited for a health assessment, including biochemical, anthropometric and questionnaire measures, and testing for the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> RESULTS: Of the 199 eligible individuals with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosed during follow-up, 152 (76%) attended for health assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median duration of clinically recognised <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was significantly longer in cases arising in the screened (5.0 years) compared with the unscreened population (1.7 years; p = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinical measures, prescribed medication and functional status were similar between screened and unscreened populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> screening resulted in cases being identified on average 3.3 years earlier, a difference significantly shorter than previous estimates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Earlier diagnosis did not appear to impact on health outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further evidence is needed to justify the introduction of population-based screening </plain></SENT>
