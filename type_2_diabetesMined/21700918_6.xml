<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, evidence from prospective studies is sparse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was performed to evaluate prospective associations of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with selected POPs among the elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Nineteen POPs (14 polychlorinated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17097">biphenyl</z:chebi> [PCB] congeners, 3 organochlorine pesticides, 1 brominated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39258">diphenyl ether</z:chebi>, and 1 dioxin) were measured in plasma collected at baseline in 725 participants, aged 70 years, of the Prospective Investigation of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors (PIVUS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After adjusting for known type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk factors, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, odds ratios (ORs) (95% CIs) for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at age 75 years (n = 36) according to the quintiles of a summary measure of concentrations of PCBs (vs. the lowest quintile) were 4.5, 5.1, 8.8 (1.8-42.7), and 7.5 (1.4-38.8) (P(trend) &lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38656">organochlorine pesticides</z:chebi>, adjusted ORs across concentrations of trans-nonachlor showed that P(trend) = 0.03 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adjusted ORs (95% CIs) across quintiles of the sum of three <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38656">organochlorine pesticides</z:chebi> were 1.1, 1.6, 1.5, and 3.4 (1.0-11.7) (P(trend) = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neither brominated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39258">diphenyl ether</z:chebi> 47 nor <z:chebi fb="44" ids="28119">dioxin</z:chebi> was significantly associated with incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The sum of PCBs improved reclassification significantly when added to traditional risk factors for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite the small number of incident cases, this study found that environmental exposure to some POPs substantially increased risk of future type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in an elderly population </plain></SENT>
