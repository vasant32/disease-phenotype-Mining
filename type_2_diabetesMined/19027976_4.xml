<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and sixty-three patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> of 1.5mg/dL or below were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17840">indoxyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> levels were measured, and general laboratory parameters and patient background were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The relationship between serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17840">indoxyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> level and renal function was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A strong negative correlation was observed between serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17840">indoxyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> level and renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate) (r=-0.4355, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17840">indoxyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> also showed a significant positive correlation with serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> nitrogen, and a negative correlation with hematocrit and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When the patients were stratified by the estimated glomerular filtration rate, serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17840">indoxyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> was elevated in groups with estimated glomerular filtration rates of 60-89 mL/min/1.73 m(2) and below </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present results demonstrate a clear correlation between serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17840">indoxyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> level and renal function, suggesting that the removal of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17840">indoxyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> may be needed from the early stage of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
