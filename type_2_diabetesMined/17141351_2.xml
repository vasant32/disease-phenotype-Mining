<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The relationships between insulin secretion and resistance in subjects with newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetes</z:e> (preDM) and type 2 DM according to the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> (MS) were controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed OGTT on 322 drug naive subjects with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> of &lt; or =3 months, and divided into three groups, NGT, preDM (IFG and/or IGT), and T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also diagnosed these subjects with respect to MS according to ATP III criteria modified by Asia-Pacific guidelines and compared IGI and HOMA-IR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When compare groups stratified by the presence of MS, preDM and T2DM groups with MS showed significantly higher mean HOMA-IR and IGI than those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When compare groups with respect to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, NGT, preDM, and T2DM subgroups in MS group showed significant higher HOMA-IR and lower IGI according to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, NGT, preDM, and T2DM subgroups in non-MS group showed a significant decrease in IGI but no significant difference in HOMA-IR as <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance worsened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, deterioration in IGI and aggravation of HOMA-IR are both important in the primary pathogenesis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in those with MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, IGI deterioration may be the only important factor in the primary pathogenesis of T2DM in the absence of MS </plain></SENT>
