<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data from 31 subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 61 nondiabetic control subjects were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 24-h energy expenditure, basal metabolic rate (BMR), and sleeping energy expenditure (EEsleep) between 1:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. were measured in whole-body respiratory chambers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Body composition was assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No significant differences in unadjusted EEsleep, BMR, and 24-h energy expenditure were observed between the type 2 diabetic group and the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for fat-free mass (FFM), fat mass, SPA, sex, and age, EEsleep and BMR were, respectively, 7.7 and 6.9% higher in the type 2 diabetic group compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was equivalent to 144 +/- 40 kcal/day (P = 0.001) and 139 +/- 61 kcal/day (P = 0.026), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adjusted 24-h energy expenditure was 6.5% higher in the type 2 diabetic group compared with the nondiabetic control subjects (2,679 +/- 37 vs. 2,515 +/- 23 kcal/day, P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In multiple regression analyses, FFM, fat mass, SPA, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> status were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significant determinants of EEsleep and 24-h energy expenditure, explaining 83 and 81% of the variation, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms reports in Pima Indians that basal and 24-h energy expenditure adjusted for body composition, SPA, sex, and age are higher in individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with nondiabetic control subjects and may be even more pronounced in Caucasians </plain></SENT>
