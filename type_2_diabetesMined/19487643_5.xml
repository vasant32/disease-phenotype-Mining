<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Absolute change in VAT and SAT measured by abdominal computed tomography scans has been obtained at a 5-year interval from African Americans (n = 389) and Hispanic Americans (n = 844), aged 20-69 years, in 10-year age-groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS Mean 5-year increases in VAT areas in women were 18, 7, 4, 0.4, and -3 cm(2) for African Americans and 13, 7, 3, 1, and -15 cm(2) for Hispanics, across the 5 age decades (trend not significant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean 5-year increases in SAT areas in women were 88, 46, 19, 17, and 14 cm(2) for African Americans and 53, 20, 17, 12, and 1 cm(2) for Hispanics, across the 5 age decades (P &lt; 0.05 for both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similar trends have been observed in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS Accumulation of abdominal fat is greatest in young adulthood </plain></SENT>
