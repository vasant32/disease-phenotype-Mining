<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI) is a major constituent of neutrophils that possesses anti-inflammatory properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>Inflammation</z:mp> is increasingly recognized as a component of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the production of BPI could be linked to insulin sensitivity and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We studied circulating BPI across categories of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also studied whether these cross-sectional associations were of functional importance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For this reason, we investigated circulating bioactive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> and the effects of changing insulin action-after treatment with an insulin sensitizer (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>)-on circulating BPI in subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, we tested whether a 3'-untranslated region (UTR) BPI polymorphism led to differences in BPI and insulin action among nondiabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Age- and BMI-adjusted circulating BPI was significantly lower among patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Circulating BPI correlated negatively with fasting and postload <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo>, BPI was also linked to BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, and age- and BMI-adjusted insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Bioactive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> was negatively correlated with circulating BPI (r = -0.57, P &lt; 0.0001) and positively with plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi>-binding protein (r = 0.54, P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In parallel to improved insulin sensitivity, plasma BPI significantly increased in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> group but not in the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A 3'-UTR BPI polymorphism was simultaneously associated with plasma BPI concentration, waist-to-hip ratio, fasting and postload insulin concentration, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, and insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that this component of the innate immune system is associated with metabolic pathways </plain></SENT>
