<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was carried out to test the hypothesis that hyperandrogenemia is associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in women and thus may contribute to the increased risk of CHD in women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Sex hormones, <z:chebi fb="25" ids="50112">sex hormone</z:chebi>-binding globulin (SHBG), and risk factors for CHD were measured in 20 postmenopausal women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and in 29 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the diabetic and control subjects were Hispanic women aged &gt;55 years who were not taking hormone replacement therapy <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering drugs, or insulin and who were otherwise randomly chosen from a cohort of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-free subjects from the Northern Manhattan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Study RESULTS: Mean age, BMI, total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, blood pressure, and smoking were not significantly different between cases and control subjects, but waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) was significantly higher in the diabetic subjects (P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean levels of free <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> (FT) (P = 0.01), dehydroepiandrosterone <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> (P&lt;0.04), and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> (P = 0.01) (controlled for WHR) were significantly higher in the diabetic subjects; with the statistical outliers removed, the <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> (P = 0.05) and androstenedione (P = 0.002) levels (controlled for WHR) were also significantly higher in the diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results were similar in the 10 diabetic subjects treated with diet only Significant positive correlations (controlled for age and BMI) were observed between FT or <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> and cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, and blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Postmenopausal Hispanic women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had both hyperandrogenemia and hyperestrogenemia, and <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> or FT correlated positively with risk factors for CHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hyperandrogenemia may be a link between <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and CHD in women </plain></SENT>
