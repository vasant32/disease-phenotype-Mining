<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 178 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> participated in this cross-sectional, observational study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data were obtained by patient interview using validated measures of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> attitude, knowledge, self-efficacy, care communication, and perceived barriers to treatment, as well as sociodemographic and biomedical data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Women and ethnic minorities with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have more psychological barriers to insulin treatment (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The final regression model showed that individuals who believed in the value of tight <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control, had strong self-efficacy, and had better interpersonal processes with their healthcare providers were less reluctant to use insulin treatment (R(2) = 0.403; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
