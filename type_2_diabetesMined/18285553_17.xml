<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Compared with nondiabetic subjects, type 2 diabetic subjects are metabolically inflexible with impaired fasting fat oxidation and impaired carbohydrate oxidation during a hyperinsulinemic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that impaired insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> oxidation is a consequence of the lower cellular <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake rate in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we compared metabolic flexibility to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> adjusted for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal rate in nondiabetic versus type 2 diabetic subjects and in the latter group after 1 year of lifestyle intervention (the Look AHEAD [Action For Health in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp>] trial) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Macronutrient oxidation rates under fasting and hyperinsulinemic conditions (clamp at 80 mU/m(2) per min), body composition (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), and relevant hormonal/metabolic blood variables were assessed in 59 type 2 diabetic and 42 nondiabetic individuals matched for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, sex, and race </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Measures were repeated in diabetic participants after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Metabolic flexibility to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (change in respiratory quotient [RQ]) was mainly related to insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal rate (R(2) = 0.46, P &lt; 0.0001) with an additional 3% of variance accounted for by plasma free fatty acid concentration at the end of the clamp (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The impaired metabolic flexibility to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> observed in type 2 diabetic versus nondiabetic subjects (Delta RQ 0.06 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.10 +/- 0.01, respectively, P &lt; 0.0001) was no longer observed after adjusting for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal rate (P = 0.19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the increase in metabolic flexibility to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> was accounted for by the concomitant increase in insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that metabolic inflexibility to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in type 2 diabetic subjects is mostly related to defective <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transport </plain></SENT>
