<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This is a matched cohort study based on the Real-Life Effectiveness and Care Patterns of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Management study, a multicentre, observational study with retrospective medical chart reviews of T2DM patients in Spain, France, UK, Norway, Finland, Germany and Poland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Included patients were aged &gt; or =30 years at time of diagnosis of T2DM who added a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> or a PPARgamma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> to failing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy (index date) and had concurrent MVC (cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A control cohort with T2DM but without concurrent MVC was identified using 1:1 propensity score matching </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Logit models were used to identify the relationship between concurrent MVC and the likelihood of emergency room admission, receiving medical/surgical procedures, and hospitalization during the study period after controlling for baseline demographics, clinical information and baseline treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Negative binomial models were used to predict the number of office visits and length of hospital stay per year attributable to the concurrent MVC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Relative to controls, patients with MVC were significantly more likely to have emergency department admissions [odds ratio (OR) 2.69; 95% CI: 1.56-4.65], receiving medical/surgical procedures (OR 2.57; 95% CI: 1.56-4.21) and hospitalizations (OR 2.58; 95% CI: 1.64-4.07) after controlling for other predictors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similarly, MVC were associated with 1.49 additional office visits per year (p = 0.036) and 0.32 days of hospital stay per year (p = 0.023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Within a seven-country European sample, this study showed that T2DM patients with MVC were more likely to use healthcare resources compared with T2DM patients without MVC </plain></SENT>
