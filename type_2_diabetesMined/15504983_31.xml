<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rare mutations in the HNF4alpha gene cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0004904'>maturity-onset diabetes of the young</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A number of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> linkage studies have found evidence of linkage to 20q12-13.1 where the HNF4alpha gene is located </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two recent studies have found an association between four common variants of the alternative P2 promoter region and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These variants are in strong linkage disequilibrium, and the minor alleles define one common risk haplotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In both studies, the risk haplotype explained a large proportion of the evidence of linkage to 20q12-13.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We aimed to assess this haplotype in a U.K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Caucasian study of 5,256 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We typed two single nucleotide polymorphisms tagging the risk haplotype (rs4810424 and rs2144908) and found evidence of association in both case-control and family-based studies; rs4810424 marginally demonstrated the stronger association with an overall estimated odds ratio of 1.15 (95% CI 1.02-1.33) (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The effect of the P2 haplotype on type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk is less than in the initial studies, probably reflecting that these studies used 20q12-13.1-linked cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we have replicated the association of the HNF4alpha P2 promoter haplotype with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a U.K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Caucasian population where there is no evidence of linkage to 20q </plain></SENT>
