<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a genome-wide search for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related genes, using measures of glycemia as quantitative traits in 330 pedigrees from the Framingham Heart Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of 3,799 attendees at the 5th Offspring Study exam cycle (1991--1995), 1,461, 1,251, and 771 men (49%) and women provided information on levels of 20-year mean fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, current fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and HbA(1c), respectively, and 1,308 contributed genotype data (using 401 microsatellite markers with an average spacing of 10 cM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Levels of glycemic traits were adjusted for age, cigarette smoking, alcohol and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> use, physical activity, and BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We ranked standardized residuals from these models, created normalized deviates from the ranks, and used the variance component model implemented in SOLAR (Sequential Oligogenic Linkage Analysis Routines) to evaluate linkage to normalized deviates as quantitative traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found peak evidence for linkage to 20-year mean fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels on chromosome 1 at approximately 247 cM from p-telomere (pter) (multipoint logarithm of odds [LOD] 2.33) and on chromosome 10 at approximately 86 cM from pter (multipoint LOD 2.07); to current fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels on chromosome 1 at approximately 218 cM from pter (multipoint LOD 1.80) and on chromosome 10 at approximately 96 cM from pter (multipoint LOD 2.15); and to HbA(1c) levels on chromosome 1 at approximately 187 cM (multipoint LOD 2.81) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This analysis of unselected European Caucasian pedigrees suggests localization of quantitative trait loci influencing <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis on chromosomes 1q and 10q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Findings at approximately 187--218 cM on chromosome 1 appear to replicate linkage reported in previous studies of other populations, pointing to this large chromosomal region as worthy of more detailed scrutiny in the search for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility genes </plain></SENT>
