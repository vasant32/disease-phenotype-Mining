<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">Glycogen</z:chebi> synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is involved in regulation (phosphorylation and deactivation) of GS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To access the potential role of GSK-3 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and reduced GS activity in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the expression and activity of GSK-3 were studied in biopsies of vastus lateralis from type 2 and nondiabetic subjects before and after 3-h hyperinsulinemic (300 mU x m(-2) x min(-1))-euglycemic clamps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The specific activity of GSK-3alpha did not differ between nondiabetic and diabetic muscle and was decreased similarly after 3-h insulin infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, protein levels of both alpha and beta isoforms of GSK-3 were elevated (approximately 30%) in diabetic muscle compared with lean (P &lt; 0.01) and weight-matched <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> nondiabetic subjects (P &lt; 0.05) and were unchanged by insulin infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, both basal and insulin-stimulated total GSK-3 activities were elevated by approximately twofold in diabetic muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>GSK-3 expression was related to in vivo insulin action, as GSK-3 protein was negatively correlated with maximal insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In summary, GSK-3 protein levels and total activities are 1) elevated in type 2 diabetic muscle independent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and 2) inversely correlated with both GS activity and maximally insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that increased GSK-3 expression in diabetic muscle may contribute to the impaired GS activity and skeletal muscle <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> present in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
