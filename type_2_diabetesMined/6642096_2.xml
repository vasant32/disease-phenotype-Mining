<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two studies demonstrating the clinical relevance of the labile fraction of <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c are presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Haemolysates, dialysed at 37 degrees C against 0.9% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi>, showed an average decrease of <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c value of 7.0% of total glycosylated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi>, post-dialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was a close correlation between the pre- and post-dialysis <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c values (r = 0.9644) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In four Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetic subjects, blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and pre- and post-dialysis <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c values were determined at weekly intervals over an 18-week period, including 6 weeks when oral hypoglycaemic therapy was withheld </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During this time, pre- and post-dialysis <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c values responded synchronously to changes in blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean coefficient of variation of the pre- and post-dialysis <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c values did not differ significantly over the 18-week period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the routine elimination of the labile fraction of <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c is not necessary to assess control in Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
