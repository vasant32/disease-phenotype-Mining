<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here it was found to activate <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and the mechanism by which this occurred, as well as the effects on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15866">Deoxyglucose</z:chebi> uptake and AMPK phosphorylation were examined in L6 myotubes and isolated skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Gluconeogenesis and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> synthesis were evaluated in rat primary hepatocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> effects of arctigenin on <z:mp ids='MP_0005266'>metabolic abnormalities</z:mp> were observed in C57BL/6J and ob/ob mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Changes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane potential were measured using the J-aggregate-forming dye, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52097">JC-1</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of respiration of L6 myotubes or isolated mitochondria was conducted in a channel oxygen system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Arctigenin increased AMPK phosphorylation and stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake in L6 myotubes and isolated skeletal muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In primary hepatocytes, it decreased gluconeogenesis and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The enhancement of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake and suppression of hepatic gluconeogenesis and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> synthesis by arctigenin were prevented by blockade of AMPK activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The respiration of L6 myotubes or isolated mitochondria was inhibited by arctigenin with a specific effect on respiratory complex I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A single oral dose of arctigenin reduced gluconeogenesis in C57BL/6J mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> oral administration of arctigenin lowered blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and improved <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism in ob/ob mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: This study demonstrates a new role for arctigenin as a potent indirect activator of AMPK via inhibition of respiratory complex I, with beneficial effects on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disorders</z:e> in ob/ob mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This highlights the potential value of arctigenin as a possible treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
