<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined whether aerobic exercise could reduce arterial stiffness in older adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> complicated by comorbid <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A total of 36 older adults (mean age 71.4 +/- 0.7 years) with diet-controlled or oral hypoglycemic-controlled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects were randomly assigned to one of two groups: an aerobic group (3 months vigorous aerobic exercise) and a nonaerobic group (no aerobic exercise) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Exercise sessions were supervised by a certified exercise trainer three times per week, and a combination of cycle ergometers and treadmills was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Arterial stiffness was measured using the Complior device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS When the two groups were compared, aerobic training resulted in a decrease in measures of both radial (-20.7 +/- 6.3 vs. +8.5 +/- 6.6%, P = 0.005) and femoral (-13.9 +/- 6.7 vs. +4.4 +/- 3.3%, P = 0.015) pulse-wave velocity despite the fact that aerobic fitness as assessed by Vo(2max) did not demonstrate an improvement with training (P = 0.026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS Our findings indicate that a relatively short aerobic exercise intervention in older adults can reduce multifactorial arterial stiffness (type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, aging, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
