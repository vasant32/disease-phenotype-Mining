<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (HSCRP), which is associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, has been flagged as a novel predictor for cerebrovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This preliminary study was therefore designed to test the hypothesis that the presence of WML correlates with HSCRP and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in type 2 diabetic patients not receiving insulin treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, 102 type 2 diabetic patients were divided into two groups; a WML-positive group (59+/-6 years, mean+/-SD, n=40) and a WML-negative group (58+/-6 years, n=62) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The level of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was assessed by fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG), fasting immunoreactive insulin (F-IRI), homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">Hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The body mass index was higher in the WML-positive group than in the WML-negative group (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma levels of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> were higher while <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>) was lower in the WML-positive group than in the WML-negative group (p&lt;0.01 and p&lt;0.005, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (p&lt;0.005), insulin concentrations (p&lt;0.0001), HOMA index (p&lt;0.0001), and HSCRP (&lt;0.0001) levels were higher in the WML-positive group than in the WML-negative group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic analysis revealed that WML was independently predicted by the high HSCRP and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (p&lt;0.005, p&lt;0.0005, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results of this preliminary study indicate that the presence of WML was associated with the high HSCRP and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in these Japanese patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>; larger cohort studies are warranted to confirm these findings </plain></SENT>
