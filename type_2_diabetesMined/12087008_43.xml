<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A 1-year multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 120 mg orlistat t.i.d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>(n = 249) or placebo (n = 254) combined with a reduced-calorie diet was conducted in overweight and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with suboptimal control of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 1 year of treatment, mean (+/-SE) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> was greater in the orlistat than in the placebo group (-4.6 +/- 0.3% vs. -1.7 +/- 0.3% of baseline wt, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Orlistat treatment caused a greater improvement in glycemic control than placebo, as evidenced by a greater reduction in serum HbA(1c), adjusted for changes in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> therapy (-0.90 +/- 0.08 vs. -0.61 +/- 0.08, P = 0.014); a greater proportion of patients achieving decreases in HbA(1c) of &gt; or = 0.5 and &gt; or = 1.0% (both P &lt; 0.01); and a greater reduction in fasting serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (-2.0 +/- 0.2 vs. -0.7 +/- 0.2 mmol/l, P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with the placebo group, patients treated with orlistat also had greater decreases in total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, and systolic blood pressure (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although more subjects treated with orlistat experienced gastrointestinal side effects than placebo (83 vs. 62%, P &lt; 0.05), more subjects in the placebo group withdrew prematurely from the study than in the orlistat group (44 vs. 35%, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Orlistat is a useful adjunctive treatment for producing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and improving glycemic control, serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels, and blood pressure in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who are being treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
