<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Insulin receptor substrate-2 (IRS-2) plays an essential role in pancreatic islet β-cells by promoting growth and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IRS-2 turnover is rapid in primary β-cells, but its expression is highly regulated at the transcriptional level, especially by <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim was to investigate the molecular mechanism on how <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> regulates IRS-2 gene expression in β-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Rat islets were exposed to inhibitors or subjected to adenoviral vector-mediated gene manipulations and then to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced IRS-2 expression analyzed by real-time PCR and immunoblotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) interaction with IRS-2 promoter was analyzed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced NFAT translocation by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi>-induced IRS-2 expression occurred in pancreatic islet β-cells in vivo but not in liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Modulating rat islet β-cell Ca(2+) influx with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">nifedipine</z:chebi> or depolarization demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced IRS-2 gene expression was dependent on a rise in intracellular calcium concentration derived from extracellular sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Calcineurin inhibitors (FK506, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi>, and a <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> calcineurin inhibitor [CAIN]) abolished <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced IRS-2 mRNA and protein levels, whereas expression of a constitutively active calcineurin increased them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Specific inhibition of NFAT with the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> inhibitor VIVIT prevented a <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced IRS-2 transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>NFATc1 translocation to the nucleus in response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and association of NFATc1 to conserved NFAT binding sites in the IRS-2 promoter were demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The mechanism behind <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced transcriptional control of IRS-2 gene expression specific to the islet β-cell is mediated by the Ca(2+)/calcineurin/NFAT pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This insight into the IRS-2 regulation could provide novel therapeutic means in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> to maintain an adequate functional mass </plain></SENT>
