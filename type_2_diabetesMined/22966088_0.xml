<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine, for the first time, the association between a novel inflammatory cytokine, angiopoietin-like protein (ANGPTL) 2, and the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 2,164 community-dwelling Japanese individuals aged 40 to 79 years without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were followed up for 7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum ANGPTL2 levels were divided into quartile categories at baseline: &lt;2.15, 2.16-2.71, 2.72-3.40, and â‰¥3.41 ng/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, 221 participants developed T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In multivariate analyses, after adjusting for comprehensive risk factors and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels, the risk of developing T2DM was significantly higher in the highest ANGPTL2 quartile than in the lowest quartile (hazard ratio, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.14-2.85; P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Elevated serum ANGPTL2 levels were positively associated with the development of T2DM in a general population, independent of other risk factors including hs-CRP levels </plain></SENT>
