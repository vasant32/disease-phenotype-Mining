<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This randomised (using a telephone or web-based randomisation system), parallel-group, controlled 26 week trial of 581 patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> on prior monotherapy (HbA(1c) 7.5-10%) and combination therapy (7.0-10%) was conducted in 107 centres in 17 countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was HbA(1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomised (2:1:2) to liraglutide 1.8 mg once daily (n = 232), liraglutide placebo (n = 115) and open-label insulin glargine (n = 234), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (1 g twice daily) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> (4 mg once daily) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Investigators, participants and study monitors were blinded to the treatment status of the liraglutide and placebo groups at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The number of patients analysed as intention to treat were: liraglutide n = 230, placebo n = 114, insulin glargine n = 232 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Liraglutide reduced HbA(1c) significantly vs glargine (1.33% vs 1.09%; -0.24% difference, 95% CI 0.08, 0.39; p = 0.0015) and placebo (-1.09% difference, 95% CI 0.90, 1.28; p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was greater <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> with liraglutide vs placebo (treatment difference -1.39 kg, 95% CI 2.10, 0.69; p = 0.0001), and vs glargine (treatment difference -3.43 kg, 95% CI 4.00, 2.86; p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Liraglutide reduced systolic BP (-4.0 mmHg) vs glargine (+0.5 mmHg; -4.5 mmHg difference, 95% CI 6.8, -2.2; p = 0.0001) but not vs placebo (p = 0.0791) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0745153" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemic episodes</z:e> (major, minor and symptoms only, respectively) were 0.06, 1.2 and 1.0 events/patient/year, respectively, in the liraglutide group (vs 0, 1.3, 1.8 and 0, 1.0, 0.5 with glargine and placebo, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A slightly higher number of adverse events (including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> at 14%) were reported with liraglutide, but only 9.8% of participants in the group receiving liraglutide developed anti-liraglutide antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Liraglutide added to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> produced significant improvement in glycaemic control and bodyweight compared with placebo and insulin glargine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The difference vs insulin glargine in HbA(1c) was within the predefined non-inferiority margin </plain></SENT>
