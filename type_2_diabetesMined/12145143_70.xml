<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Ala allele of the common Pro12Ala polymorphism in the isoform PPAR-gamma2 is associated with reduced risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effect on the individual is weak, but because of a prevalence of &gt;75% of the high-risk Pro allele, the population-attributable risk is enormous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The in vivo effects of the polymorphism are secondary to alterations in adipose tissue, where PPAR-gamma2 is predominantly expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moderate reduction in transcriptional activity of PPAR-gamma as a result of the polymorphism modulates production and release of adipose-derived factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both decreased release of insulin-desensitizing free fatty acids, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha, and resistin and increased release of the insulin-sensitizing hormone adiponectin result in secondary improvement of insulin sensitivity of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake and suppression of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The population effect of this polymorphism may be modulated by environmental or genetic factors such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, ethnicity, ratio of unsaturated to <z:chebi fb="4" ids="26607">saturated fatty acids</z:chebi>, and genetic background </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Once <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> has developed, the protective effect of the Ala allele may be lost, since increased vascular complications and more pronounced <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta-cell dysfunction</z:hpo> have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These observations, however, are currently unexplained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the Pro12Ala polymorphism in PPAR-gamma2 represents the first genetic variant with a broad impact on the risk of common type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The precise understanding of its mechanism may lead to novel diagnostic, preventive, and therapeutic approaches for improving the management of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
