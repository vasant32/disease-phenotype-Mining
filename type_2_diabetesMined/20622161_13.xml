<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the associations of exposure to the Chinese famine (1959-1961) during fetal life and childhood with the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used the data for 7,874 rural adults born between 1954 and 1964 in selected communities from the cross-sectional 2002 China National Nutrition and Health Survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>Hyperglycemia</z:hpo> was defined as fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> ≥6.1 mmol/l and/or 2-h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> ≥7.8 mmol/l and/or a previous clinical diagnosis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Prevalences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> among adults in nonexposed, fetal exposed, early-childhood, mid-childhood, and late-childhood exposed cohorts were 2.4%, 5.7%, 3.9%, 3.4%, and 5.9%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In severely affected famine areas, fetal-exposed subjects had an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> compared with nonexposed subjects (odds ratio = 3.92; 95% CI: 1.64-9.39; P = 0.002); this difference was not observed in less severely affected famine areas (odds ratio = 0.57; 95% CI: 0.25-1.31; P = 0.185) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The odds ratios were significantly different between groups from the severe and less severe famine areas (P for interaction = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In severely affected famine areas, fetal-exposed subjects who followed an affluent/Western dietary pattern (odds ratios = 7.63; 95% CI: 2.41-24.1; P = 0.0005) or who had a higher economic status in later life experienced a substantially elevated risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> (odds ratios = 6.20; 95% CI: 2.08-18.5; P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Fetal exposure to the severe Chinese famine increases the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> in adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This association appears to be exacerbated by a nutritionally rich environment in later life </plain></SENT>
