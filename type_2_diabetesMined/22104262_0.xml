<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: The purpose of the present study was to distinguish the effects of both <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> type 2 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DM2</z:e>) and diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001271'>polyneuropathy</z:hpo> (DPN) on mobility, muscle strength and health related quality of life (HR-QoL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: DPN patients (n=98), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DM2</z:e> patients without DPN (DC) (n=39) and healthy subjects (HC) (n=19) performed isometric and isokinetic lower limb muscle strength tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mobility was determined by a timed up and go test (TUGT), a 6 min walk test and the physical activity scale for the elderly questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HR-QoL was determined by the SF36 questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: DPN patients had moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001271'>polyneuropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In both DPN and DC patients leg muscle strength was reduced by 30-50% compared to HC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Muscle strength was correlated with mobility tests, and reduced muscle strength as well as impaired mobility were associated with a loss of HR-Qol (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We did not observe major differences in muscle strength, mobility (except for the TUGT, p&lt;0.01) and HR-QoL between diabetic patients with and without DPN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DM2</z:e> patients, with and without DPN, have decreased maximal muscle strength in the lower limbs and impaired mobility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These abnormalities are associated with a loss of HR-QoL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The additional effect of moderate DPN was small in our patients </plain></SENT>
