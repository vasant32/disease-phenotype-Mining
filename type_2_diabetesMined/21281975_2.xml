<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To investigate whether the effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> DNA (mtDNA) content is tissue-specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: We compared the mtDNA contents in leg muscle, blood vessel, and peripheral leucocytes in seventeen patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2DM) with those of seven controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We measured 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) expression in the muscles and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33202">thiobarbituric acid</z:chebi> reactive substance (TBARS) in sera to evaluate <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical detection of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15546">PGC1</z:chebi>-α), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> transcription factor A (Tfam), and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were performed in the muscle tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mtDNA copy number was highest in muscle tissue, followed by blood vessel tissue, and lowest in leucocytes in both the diabetic and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The diabetic patients had less mtDNA content in the muscle than the controls (2.86±0.33 vs. 3.20±0.14, P=0.025), but more mtDNA content in the leucocytes (2.25±0.26 vs. 1.98±0.06, P=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In both groups, there was a positive correlation between muscle tissue mtDNA content and the expression of 8-OHdG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with T2DM had significantly increased 8-OHdG and TUNEL labeling index and non-significant increases in the expression of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15546">PGC1</z:chebi>-α and Tfam </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>Oxidative stress</z:mp> stimulates <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> biogenesis but induces a greater degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in diabetic patients, resulting in a decrease in muscle tissue mtDNA content </plain></SENT>
