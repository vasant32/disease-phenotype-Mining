<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the effect of basal, biphasic, prandial, and basal-bolus insulin regimens with insulin analogs to reach the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c) (HbA(1c)) target of &lt;7% in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted an electronic search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving insulin analogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RCTs were included if they lasted at least 12 weeks, reported the proportion of diabetic patients reaching the HbA(1c) target of &lt;7% (primary outcome), and the number of patients in any arm was &gt;30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found 16 RCTs, with 20 comparisons and 7,759 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A greater proportion of patients achieved the HbA(1c) goal of &lt;7% with both biphasic (odds ratio 1.88 [95% CI 1.38-2.55]) and prandial (2.07 [1.16-3.69]) insulin compared with basal insulin; this was associated for biphasic insulin with greater <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> (event/patient/30 days, mean difference, 0.34 [range 0-0.69]) and <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> in kg (1.0 kg [0.28-1.73]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with biphasic insulin, the basal-bolus regimen was associated with a greater chance to reach the HbA(1c) goal (odds ratio 1.75 [95% CI 1.11-2.77]), with no greater <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The effect of insulin analogs on long-term <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> complications is still lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A greater proportion of type 2 diabetic patients can achieve the HbA(1c) goal &lt;7% with biphasic or prandial insulin compared with basal insulin; in absolute terms, the basal-bolus regimen was best for the attainment of the HbA(1c) goal </plain></SENT>
