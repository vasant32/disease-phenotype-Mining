<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine the day-to-day variability of measures of beta cell function derived from an OGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-seven adults (13 with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, ten with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo>, 14 with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) underwent a standard 2 h 75 g OGTT on two separate days (median time between tests, 7 days; range, 5-14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From these data, the reproducibility of several indices of beta cell function were determined: insulinogenic index (DeltaI(0-30)/DeltaG(0-30)), early C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> response (DeltaCP(0-30)/DeltaG(0-30)), incremental AUC insulin to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> response (incAUC(ins)/incAUC(glu)), integrated insulin secretion response from 0 to 120 min (IS/Glu(0-120)) and indices of beta cell function derived from a mathematical model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Within-subject variability for DeltaI(0-30)/DeltaG(0-30) (CV 57.1%) was higher than DeltaCP(0-30)/DeltaG(0-30) (CV 34.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Measures integrated over the full 120 min of the OGTT, incAUC(ins)/incAUC(glu) (CV 24.9%) and IS/Glu(0-120) (CV 17.4%), demonstrated less variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mathematical model-derived measures of beta cell <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> sensitivity (CV 20.3%) and potentiation (CV 33.0%) showed moderate variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The impact of the different measures' variability on sample size (30% change from baseline) is demonstrated by calculated sample sizes of 89 for DeltaI(0-30)/DeltaG(0-30), 37 for DeltaCP(0-30)/DeltaG(0-30), 21 for incAUC(ins)/incAUC(glu) and 11 for IS/Glu(0-120) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Some OGTT-derived indices of beta cell function, in particular the insulinogenic index, demonstrate high within-subject variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Integrated measures that utilise multiple time points and measures that use C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> show less variability and may lead to a reduced sample size requirement </plain></SENT>
