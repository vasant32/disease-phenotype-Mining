<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is not known whether physical exercise stimulates GLUT4 translocation in skeletal muscle of individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five subjects (two men, three women) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and five <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects (5 men), as determined by a standard 75-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test, were recruited to determine whether an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> bout of cycle exercise activates the translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane in skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each subject had two open biopsies of vastus lateralis muscle; one at rest and one 3-6 weeks later from the opposite leg after 45-60 min of cycle exercise at 60-70% of VO2max </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Skeletal muscle plasma membranes were prepared by subcellular fractionation, and GLUT4 content was determined by Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma membrane GLUT4 increased in each subject in response to exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean increase in plasma membrane GLUT4 for the subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 74 +/-20% above resting values, and for the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects the increase was 71+/-18% above resting values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although plasma membrane GLUT4 content was approximately 32% lower at rest and after exercise in the muscle of the subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the differences were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that in contrast to the previously reported defect in insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation in skeletal muscle of individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, a single bout of exercise results in the translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane in skeletal muscle of individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data provide the first direct evidence that GLUT4 translocation is an important cellular mechanism through which exercise enhances skeletal muscle <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake in individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
