<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin Resistance</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Study (IRAS) was a prospective study of the associations of insulin sensitivity and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the relationship between smoking status categories (never, former, and current) and incident 5-year type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among 906 participants free of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also considered the effect of pack-year categories (never, former &lt;20 pack-years, former &gt; or = 20 pack-years, current &lt;20 pack-years, and current &gt; or = 20 pack-years) upon <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of current smokers, 96 (25%) developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at 5 years, compared with 60 (14%) never smokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After multivariable adjustment, current smokers exhibited increased incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with never smokers (odds ratio [OR] 2.66, P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similar results were found among current smokers with &gt; or = 20 pack-years with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (5.66, P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Smoking shares a robust association with incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, supporting the current Surgeon General's warnings against cigarette smoking </plain></SENT>
