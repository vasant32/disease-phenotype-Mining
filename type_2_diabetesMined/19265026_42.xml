<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>beta-Cell proliferation can be acutely stimulated by a variety of stimuli in young rodents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it is unknown whether this adaptive beta-cell regeneration capacity is retained into old age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We assessed adaptive beta-cell proliferation capacity in adult mice across a wide range of ages with a variety of stimuli: partial pancreatectomy, low-dose administration of the beta-cell toxin <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi>, and exendin-4, a glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> 1 (GLP-1) <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>beta-Cell proliferation was measured by administration of 5-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="22927,47265">bromo</z:chebi>-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) in the drinking water </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Basal beta-cell proliferation was severely decreased with advanced age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Partial pancreatectomy greatly stimulated beta-cell proliferation in young mice but failed to increase beta-cell replication in old mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">Streptozotocin</z:chebi> stimulated beta-cell replication in young mice but had little effect in old mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, administration of GLP-1 agonist exendin-4 stimulated beta-cell proliferation in young but not in old mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, adaptive beta-cell proliferation capacity was minimal after 12 months of age, which is early middle age for the adult mouse life span </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Adaptive beta-cell proliferation is severely restricted with advanced age in mice, whether stimulated by partial pancreatectomy, low-dose <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi>, or exendin-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, beta-cells in middle-aged mice appear to be largely postmitotic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Young rodents may not faithfully model the regenerative capacity of beta-cells in mature adult mice </plain></SENT>
