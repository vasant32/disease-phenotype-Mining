<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The in vitro <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0877008" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">enzyme inhibition</z:e> profile of DSP-7238 was assessed using plasma and recombinant enzymes including DPP IV, DPP II, DPP8, DPP9 and fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAPalpha) with fluorogenic substrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The inhibition type was evaluated based on the Lineweaver-Burk plot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Substrate selectivity of DSP-7238 and comparator DPP IV inhibitors (vildagliptin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi>, saxagliptin and linagliptin) was evaluated by mass spectrometry based on the changes in molecular weight of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> substrates caused by release of N-terminal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46761">dipeptides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the in vivo experiments, high-fat diet-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (DIO) mice were subjected to oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) following a single oral administration of DSP-7238 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To assess the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> effects of DSP-7238 on glycaemic control and pancreatic beta-cell damage, DSP-7238 was administered for 11 weeks to mice made diabetic by a combination of high-fat diet (HFD) and a low-dose of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> (STZ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After the dosing period, HbA1c was measured and pancreatic damage was evaluated by biological and histological analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: DSP-7238 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> both competitively inhibited recombinant human DPP IV (rhDPP IV) with K(i) values of 0.60 and 2.1 nM respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neither vildagliptin nor saxagliptin exhibited competitive inhibition of rhDPP IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DSP-7238 did not inhibit DPP IV-related enzymes including DPP8, DPP9, DPP II and FAPalpha, whereas vildagliptin and saxagliptin showed inhibition of DPP8 and DPP9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) degradation by DSP-7238 was apparently more potent than its inhibition of chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 10 (IP-10) or chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 12 (SDF-1alpha) degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast, vildagliptin and saxagliptin showed similar degree of inhibition of degradation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the substrates tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Compared to treatment with the vehicle, single oral administration of DSP-7238 dose-dependently decreased plasma DPP IV activity and <z:mp ids='MP_0005292'>improved glucose tolerance</z:mp> in DIO mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In addition, DSP-7238 significantly decreased HbA1c and ameliorated pancreatic damage following 11 weeks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> treatment in HFD/STZ mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We have shown in this study that DSP-7238 is a potent DPP IV inhibitor that has high specificity for DPP IV and substrate selectivity against GLP-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>We have also found that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> treatment with DSP-7238 improves glycaemic control and ameliorates beta-cell damage in a mouse model with impaired insulin sensitivity and secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that DSP-7238 may be a new therapeutic agent for the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
