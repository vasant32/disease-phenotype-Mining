<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 319 subjects were studied with an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin concentrations were measured at baseline and every 30 min during the OGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty-eight subjects also received a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity was calculated as the total <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal (TGD) during the last 30 min of the clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-IR) was calculated from fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subjects with IFG had TGD similar to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-tolerant subjects, while subjects with IGT and combined IFG/IGT had significantly reduced TGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HOMA-IR in subjects with IFG was similar to that in subjects with combined IFG/IGT and significantly higher than HOMA-IR in subjects with IGT or NGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Insulin secretion, measured by the insulinogenic index (DeltaI(0-30)/DeltaG(0-30)) and by the ratio of the incremental area under the curve (AUC) of insulin to the incremental AUC of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (0-120 min), was reduced to the same extent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-intolerant groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When both measurements of beta-cell function were adjusted for severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, subjects with IGT and combined IFG/IGT had a significantly greater reduction in insulin secretion than subjects with IFG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Subjects with IGT and IFG have different metabolic characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Differences in insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion may predict different rates of progression to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and varying susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
