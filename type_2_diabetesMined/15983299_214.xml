<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, these previous studies were either retrospective chart reviews or clinical trials not rigorously controlled for concomitant <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>- and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examines the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> and glycemic effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We enrolled subjects with a diagnosis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (treated with diet alone or oral monotherapy) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> (not treated with any <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering agents) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After a 4-week placebo washout period, subjects randomly assigned to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> arm (n = 400) were treated with 30 mg once daily for 12 weeks followed by 45 mg once daily for an additional 12 weeks, whereas subjects randomly assigned to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> (n = 402) were treated with 4 mg once daily followed by 4 mg twice daily for the same intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">Triglyceride</z:chebi> levels were reduced by 51.9 +/- 7.8 mg/dl with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>, but were increased by 13.1 +/- 7.8 mg/dl with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.001 between treatments) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the increase in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> was greater (5.2 +/- 0.5 vs. 2.4 +/- 0.5 mg/dl; P &lt; 0.001) and the increase in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> was less (12.3 +/- 1.6 vs. 21.3 +/- 1.6 mg/dl; P &lt; 0.001) for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>, respectively </plain></SENT>
