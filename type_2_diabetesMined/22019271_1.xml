<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Compared to other races, Asians develop T2DM younger, at a lower degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, suffer longer from its complications and die earlier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Curbing this epidemic requires an integrated, risk-based, and multidisciplinary approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Inadequately managed T2DM has macrovascular and microvascular sequelae, Asians with T2DM being particularly susceptible to diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Earlier and more intensive monitoring and management of risk factors are required, especially for patients with, or at risk of, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal impairment</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Particular challenges of T2DM management in Asia include: lack of access to specialist healthcare, insufficient clinical evaluation and delayed diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As in Caucasians, conventional treatment modalities are limited by deteriorating glycaemic control with disease progression and there is an unmet need for efficacious, safe, cost-effective and convenient pharmacotherapies for treating different stages of T2DM and preventing its complications, particularly in high-risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There is a trend towards increasing use of DPP-IV inhibitors, which are no less efficacious and safe in Asians than Caucasians and may have some advantages over existing oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> agents, particularly for certain high-risk groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Such agents may play a significant future role in the management of T2DM </plain></SENT>
