<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies in first-degree relatives have indicated a genetic origin of the defective insulin activation of muscle <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase (GS) in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the relative impact of genetic versus nongenetic factors on muscle GS activation and regulation in young and elderly twins examined with a 2-h euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic (40 mU x m(-2) x min(-1)) clamp combined with indirect calorimetry and excision of muscle biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The etiological components were determined using structural equation modeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fractional GS activity; GS phosphorylation at sites 2, 2 + 2a, and 3a + 3b corrected for total GS protein; and GS kinase 3 (GSK3) activity were similar in both age groups, whereas total GS activity and protein were lower in elderly compared with younger twins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>GS fractional activity increased significantly during insulin stimulation in both young and elderly twins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conversely, there was a significant decrease in GS phosphorylation at site 3a + 3b and GSK3 activity during insulin stimulation in both age groups, whereas GS phosphorylation at site 2 and 2 + 2a only decreased on insulin stimulation in the younger twins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The increment in whole-body <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal (Rd) and nonoxidative <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism (insulin - basal) correlated significantly with the increment in GS fractional activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fractional GS activity had a major environmental component in both age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>GSK3 activity exhibited a genetic component in young (basal: a2 = 0.42; insulin: a2 = 0.58) and elderly (insulin: a2 = 0.56) twins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, GS phosphorylation at site 2 (insulin: a2 = 0.69) in the elderly and at site 3a + 3b (insulin: a2 = 0.50) in the young twins had a genetic component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, GSK3 activity and GS phosphorylation, particularly at sites 2 and 3a + 3b, had major genetic components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Total and fractional GS activities per se were, on the other hand, predominantly controlled by environmental factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Moreover, GS activity was intact with increasing age, despite a significant reduction in nonoxidative <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
