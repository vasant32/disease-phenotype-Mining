<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, other cardiometabolic risk factors, including abdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidaemia</z:e> are often overlooked in the quest for perfect <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The currently used <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> agents, including insulin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, sulphonylureas and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi>, have limited efficacy on these risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A number of new therapeutic agents are undergoing clinical development, including glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> 1 mimetics (exenatide and liraglutide) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> and vildagliptin), which target the incretin system, and the cannabinoid-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> (rimonabant), which target the endocannabinoid system, may hold some promise for meeting these unmet needs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this review, the clinical properties of these agents and potential treatment pathways to best use these agents are discussed for improving the management of T2DM and cardiovascular risk </plain></SENT>
