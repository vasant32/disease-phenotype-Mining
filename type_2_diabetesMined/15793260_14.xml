<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have identified only a few rare coding mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, recent studies suggest that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located near the P2 (beta-cell) promoter of HNF4A are associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we evaluated 23 SNPs spanning 111 kb including the HNF4A gene for association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a collection of Caucasian type 2 diabetic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal disease</z:hpo> (n = 300) and control subjects (n = 310) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None of the individual SNPs were associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in this collection of case subjects (P values ranging from 0.06 to 0.99) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, haplotype analysis identifies significant differences between haplotype frequencies in type 2 diabetic case and control subjects (P = 0.013 to P &lt; 0.001), with two uncommon "risk" haplotypes (2.4 and 2.2% of chromosomes) and two uncommon "protective" haplotypes (7.1 and 5.0% of chromosomes) accounting for the evidence of association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> linked to 20q12-13 is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> disease in which different populations may have different type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility loci </plain></SENT>
