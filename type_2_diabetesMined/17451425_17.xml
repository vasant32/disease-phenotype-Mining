<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eligible patients had <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1C)&lt; or =10%, were aged &gt; or =18 years and were on ATV 10 mg for &gt; or =6 weeks before study entry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After a 4-week open-label ATV 10 mg run-in, patients were randomized to EZE/SIMVA 10/20 mg (n = 220), EZE/SIMVA 10/40 mg (n = 222) or ATV 20 g (n = 219) daily for 6 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Greater (p &lt; or = 0.001) reductions in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>) (the primary end-point) were achieved by switching to EZE/SIMVA 10/20 mg (26.2%) or 10/40 mg (30.1%) than by doubling the dose of ATV to 20 mg (8.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EZE/SIMVA 10/20 mg and 10/40 mg produced greater (p &lt; or = 0.001) reductions in total cholesterol, non-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B relative to ATV 20 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A reduction (p &lt; or = 0.050) in C-reactive protein was observed with EZE/SIMVA 10/40 mg vs. ATV 20 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similar reductions in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> were observed across the three groups, and none of the treatments produced a significant change in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A greater (p &lt; or = 0.001) proportion of patients achieved <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> &lt;2.5 mmol/l with EZE/SIMVA 10/20 mg (90.5%) and 10/40 mg (87.0%) than with ATV 20 mg (70.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both EZE/SIMVA doses were generally well tolerated, with an overall safety profile similar to ATV 20 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: EZE/SIMVA 10/20 and 10/40 mg provided greater <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-altering efficacy than doubling the dose of ATV from 10 to 20 mg and were well tolerated in patients with T2D </plain></SENT>
