<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To examine individual items to provide descriptive and normative information and provide data on scale reliability and associations between PDQ scales and concurrently assessed HBA(1c) and BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Items were written to address nutritional management, medication utilization, blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring, and physical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The initial instrument was reviewed by multidisciplinary <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care providers and items subsequently revised until the measure provided complete coverage of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care domains using as few items as possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The scoring scheme was generated rationally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subjects were 790 adults (205 with type 1 and 585 with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) who completed the PDQ while waiting for clinic appointments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Item completion rates were high, with few items skipped by participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subscales demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach α=.650-.834) and demonstrated significant associations with BMI (p ≤.001) and HbA(1c) (p ≤.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The PDQ is a useful measure of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-care behaviors and related perceptions and barriers that is reliable and valid and feasible to administer in a clinic setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This measure may be used to obtain data for assessing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-management and barriers and to guide patient care </plain></SENT>
