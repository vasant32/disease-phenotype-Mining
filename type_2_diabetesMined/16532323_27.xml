<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that post-prandial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> is common in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, even among patients in apparently good glycaemic control, and that simple clinical characteristics identify subsets of diabetic patients with frequent post-prandial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Three self-assessed daily blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> profiles over a 1-week period, including 18 glucose readings before and 2 h after meals, were obtained from 3,284 unselected outpatients (men 51%; age 63+/-10 years) with non-insulin-treated type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> attending 500 different <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> clinics operating throughout Italy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A post-prandial blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> value &gt;8.89 mmol/l (160 mg/dl) was recorded at least once in 84% of patients, and 81% of patients had at least one Delta <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &gt; or =2.22 mmol/l (40 mg/dl) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among patients with apparently good metabolic control, 38% had &gt;40% of post-prandial blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> readings &gt;8.89 mmol/l (&gt; or =4 of 9 meals in total), and 36% had &gt;40% Delta <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &gt; or =2.22 mmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis adjusted for pre-prandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, older age, longer duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020473" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperlipidaemia</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, as well as treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi>, were significantly associated with greater <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excursions after meals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These results indicate that post-prandial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> is a very frequent phenomenon in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> on active treatment; can occur even when metabolic control is apparently good; and can be predicted by simple clinical features </plain></SENT>
