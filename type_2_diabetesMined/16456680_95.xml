<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The primary focus was changes in HbA(1c); secondary focus was diurnal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> profiles and symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this investigator-initiated open, parallel-group clinical trial involving seven centres, 110 insulin-naive type 2 diabetic patients with poor glycaemic control (HbA(1c) &gt;or=8.0%) on oral hypoglycaemic agents (90% using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>) were randomised to receive bedtime insulin glargine with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (G+MET) or bedtime <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e>+MET) for 36 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were taught how to self-adjust their insulin dose and use a modem to send the results of home <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring to treatment centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The goal was to achieve a fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) of 4.0 to 5.5 mmol/l in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the last 12 weeks, FPGs averaged 5.75+/-0.02 and 5.96+/-0.03 mmol/l (p&lt;0.001) and insulin doses were 68+/-5 and 70+/-6 IU/day (0.69+/-0.05 and 0.66+/-0.04 IU kg(-1) day(-1), NS) in the G+MET and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e>+MET groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 36 weeks, mean HbA(1c) was 7.14+/-0.12 and 7.16+/-0.14%, respectively (NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic, but not confirmed symptomatic, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> was significantly lower during the first 12 weeks in the G+MET group (4.1+/-0.8 episodes/patient-year) than in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e>+MET group (9.0+/-2.3 episodes/patient-year, p&lt;0.05), but not significantly different thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> levels before dinner were higher in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e>+MET group (10.1+/-0.3 mmol/l) than in the G+MET group (8.6+/-0.3 mmol/l, p=0.002) throughout the 36-week study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With regard to baseline characteristics such as initial glycaemia or C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, there was no difference between patients who achieved good glycaemic control (HbA(1c) &lt;7.0%) and those who did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Differences were seen in the following: between study centres, <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> during the run-in period and insulin therapy, and FPG during the last 12 weeks (5.7+/-0.2 vs 6.7+/-0.3 mmol/l for patients reaching vs those not reaching target, p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Good glycaemic control can be achieved with both G+MET and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e>+MET </plain></SENT>
