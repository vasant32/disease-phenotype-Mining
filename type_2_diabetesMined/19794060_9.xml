<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Aggregation of human amylin/islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (hA/hIAPP) into small soluble beta-sheet-containing oligomers is linked to islet beta-cell degeneration and the pathogenesis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we used <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27902">tetracycline</z:chebi>, which modifies hA/hIAPP oligomerization, to probe mechanisms whereby hA/hIAPP causes <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in hemizygous hA/hIAPP-transgenic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We chronically treated hemizygous hA/hIAPP transgenic mice with oral <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27902">tetracycline</z:chebi> to determine its effects on rates of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> initiation, progression, and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Homozygous mice developed severe spontaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> due to islet beta-cell loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hemizygous transgenic animals also developed spontaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, although severity was less and progression rates slower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pathogenesis was characterized by initial islet <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta-cell dysfunction</z:hpo> followed by progressive beta-cell loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Islet amyloid was absent from hemizygous animals with early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and correlated positively with longevity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Some long-lived nondiabetic hemizygous animals also had large islet-amyloid areas, showing that amyloid itself was not intrinsically cytotoxic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Administration of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27902">tetracycline</z:chebi> dose-dependently ameliorated <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001959'>polydipsia</z:hpo>, delayed rates of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> initiation and progression, and increased longevity compared with water-treated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report to show that treating hA/hIAPP transgenic mice with a modifier of hA/hIAPP misfolding can ameliorate their diabetic phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Fibrillar amyloid was neither necessary nor sufficient to cause <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and indeed was positively correlated with longevity therein, whereas early- to mid-stage <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was associated with islet <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta-cell dysfunction</z:hpo> followed by beta-cell loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Interventions capable of suppressing misfolding in soluble hA/hIAPP oligomers rather than mature fibrils may have potential for treating or preventing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
