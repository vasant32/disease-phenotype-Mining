<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Vildagliptin binds covalently to the catalytic site of DPP-4, eliciting prolonged <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0877008" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">enzyme inhibition</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This raises intact GLP-1 levels, both after meal ingestion and in the fasting state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Vildagliptin has been shown to stimulate insulin secretion and inhibit glucagon secretion in a <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At hypoglycaemic levels, the counterregulatory glucagon response is enhanced relative to baseline by vildagliptin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vildagliptin also inhibits hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production, mainly through changes in islet hormone secretion, and improves insulin sensitivity, as determined with a variety of methods </plain></SENT>
