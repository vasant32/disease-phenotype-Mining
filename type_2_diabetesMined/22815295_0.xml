<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether disparities in the nature and management of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> persist between Aboriginal and the majority Anglo-Celt patients in an urban Australian community </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Baseline data from the observational Fremantle <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study collected from 1993 to 1996 (phase I) and from 2008 to 2011 (phase II) were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients characterized as Aboriginal or Anglo-Celt by self-report and supporting data underwent comprehensive assessment, including questionnaires, examination, and biochemical testing in a single laboratory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Generalized linear modeling with age/sex adjustment was used to examine differences in changes in variables in the two groups between phases I and II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The indigenous participants were younger at entry and at <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosis than the Anglo-Celt participants in both phases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They were also less likely to be educated beyond primary level and were more likely to be smokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HbA(1c) decreased in both groups over time (Aboriginal median 9.6% [interquartile range 7.8-10.7%] to 8.4% [6.6-10.6%] vs. Anglo-Celt median 7.1% [6.2-8.4%] to 6.7% [6.2-7.5%]), but the gap persisted (P = 0.65 for difference between phases I and II by ethnic group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Aboriginal patients were more likely to have microvascular disease in both phases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral arterial disease</z:hpo> (ankle-brachial index â‰¤0.90 or lower-extremity <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath>) increased in Aboriginal but decreased in Anglo-Celt participants (15.8-29.7 vs. 30.7-21.5%; P = 0.055) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> management has improved for Aboriginal and Anglo-Celt Australian patients, but disparities in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> and complications persist </plain></SENT>
