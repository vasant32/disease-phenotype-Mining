<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We explored the association of cigarette smoking with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence and mortality in a large cohort of Koreans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A 14-year prospective cohort study was performed on 1,236,443 Korean men and women, aged 30-95 years at baseline, who underwent standardized biennial medical examinations provided by the National Health Insurance Corporation (NHIC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was identified on the basis of outpatient visits, hospitalization, or prescription medication treatment for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, as captured in the NHIC database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> mortality was obtained through the national statistical office </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards models were used to investigate associations of smoking with indicators of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Smoking was significantly associated with increased risk for diabetic outpatient treatment, hospitalization, and mortality among both men and women, and the risk among current smokers increased modestly with the number of cigarettes smoked daily (P(trend) &lt; 0.0001 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> associations) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with never smokers, current male smokers who smoked ≥ 20 cigarettes/day had increased risk for incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> defined by outpatient treatment (adjusted hazard ratio 1.55 [1.51-1.60]), incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> defined by ≥ 3 prescription medications for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (1.71 [1.63-1.80]), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (1.60 [1.25-2.06]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The risks for outpatient treatment among smokers were higher in men than in women with evidence for effect modification by sex and age (P(interaction) &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides longitudinal evidence that smoking increases the risk of incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and mortality </plain></SENT>
