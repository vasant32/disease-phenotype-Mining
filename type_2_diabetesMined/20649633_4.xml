<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined how improvements in muscular insulin sensitivity following <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> (ROSI) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (PIO) treatment would affect muscle <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> function in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Muscle biopsies were obtained from 21 patients with T2DM before and after 12 weeks on either ROSI (4 mg once daily) [n = 12; age, 59.2 +/- 2.2 years; body mass index (BMI), 29.6 +/- 0.7 kg/m(2)] or PIO (30 mg once daily) (n = 9; age, 56.3 +/- 2.4 years; BMI, 29.5 +/- 1.5 kg/m(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An age- and BMI-matched control group was also included (n = 8; age, 61.8 +/- 2.3 years; BMI, 28.4 +/- 0.6 kg/m(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50744">citrate</z:chebi> synthase- and beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA-dehydrogenase (HAD) activity, intramuscular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> (IMTG) and protein content of complexes I-IV were measured, while <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> respiration per milligram muscle was measured in saponin-treated skinned muscle fibres using high-resolution respirometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>Mitochondrial</z:hpo> respiration per milligram muscle was lower in T2DM compared to controls at baseline and decreased during ROSI treatment but increased during PIO treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="50744">Citrate</z:chebi> synthase activity and average protein content of complexes I-IV were unchanged in the ROSI group, but protein content of complexes II and III increased during PIO treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity improved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, but IMTG levels were unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We show opposite effects of ROSI and PIO on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> respiration, and also show that insulin sensitivity can be improved independently of changes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> respiration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We confirm that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> respiration is reduced in T2DM compared to age- and BMI-matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
