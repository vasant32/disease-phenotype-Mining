<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> had been healthy 10 years earlier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The intention was to randomly allocate those with mild <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> to a training or a control group and study the long-term influence of regular training on the progress of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, it was found that the majority--39 of 48--had other diseases or were on treatment which made regular training difficult and would have complicated the interpretation of the metabolic effects of training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight men took part in a physical training programme for up to 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Aerobic capacity, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance and serum <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> were measured before and at the end of the training period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Another group of eight men with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, of similar weight, age and relative aerobic capacity, who did not undergo the physical training, served as control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The oxygen uptake increased by 16% in the training group and decreased by 12% in the control group but no significant changes could be demonstrated in body weight, fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, serum <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance or insulin values at a 75-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients in the training group developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e>, two deteriorated metabolically (drug treatment had to be added), and there were two drop-outs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results cast doubts on the feasibility and efficacy of physical training as a long-term treatment for the majority of Type 2 diabetic patients, who are older than 60 years </plain></SENT>
