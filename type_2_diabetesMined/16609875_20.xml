<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent data indicate that macrophages reside within adipose tissue in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> rodents and humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesised that secreted macrophage factors may inhibit adipogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Conditioned media from cultured murine J774 or human <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1 macrophages were collected, and added to either murine 3T3-L1 preadipocytes or human abdominal stromal preadipocytes from subcutaneous or omental fat depots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Macrophage-conditioned medium (MacCM) strongly inhibited 3T3-L1 adipogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dose-response studies with J774-MacCM revealed that 80 and 100% of J774-MacCM completely suppressed triacylglycerol accumulation as well as the induction of fatty acid synthase, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha, and adiponectin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similar inhibitory effects on 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were observed with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1-MacCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Differentiation of human abdominal subcutaneous stromal preadipocytes was moderately reduced (subcutaneous&gt;omental) by J744-MacCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the differentiation of both subcutaneous and omental stromal preadipocytes was completely inhibited by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1-MacCM, as determined on the basis of <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and triacylglycerol accumulation, as well as fatty acid synthase and adiponectin protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Secreted macrophage products inhibit the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes as well as human abdominal stromal preadipocytes </plain></SENT>
