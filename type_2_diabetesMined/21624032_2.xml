<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the absence of a long-term study, we simulated such a trial using a mathematical model where subjects were given exenatide once-weekly (EQW), which has been shown to improve glycaemic control and reduce weight, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using the Archimedes Model, we followed a simulated population derived from individuals with T2DM in NHANES who were drug-na√Øve or on oral agents only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We modelled the effects of four treatment strategies including standard care (SC, maintaining levels of control seen in NHANES), intensive glycaemic control (IGC, target HbA1c &lt; 7% with conventional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> agents) and two versions of EQW added to SC: one with glycaemic and weight reduction only (EQW-1) and one with additional improvements in SBP and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> (EQW-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EQW strategies were derived from 52-week clinical trial data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endpoints included macrovascular and microvascular outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Simulated EQW treatment resulted in earlier benefit and 2-3 times greater relative reductions in major adverse CV events than IGC when compared to SC (6% relative reduction by year 20 for IGC vs. 12 and 17% for the EQW strategies) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For microvascular complications, EQW showed comparable benefit to IGC for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> but significantly greater impact on renal complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This analysis shows that the novel drug EQW has the potential to greatly reduce CV events through its combined effects on glycaemia, weight and other CV risk factors </plain></SENT>
