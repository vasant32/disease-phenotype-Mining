<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, FFA inhibition of GSIS has not been clearly demonstrated in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the in vivo effect of prolonged elevation of plasma FFAs on GSIS using a two-step hyperglycemic clamp in rats treated with a 48-h intravenous infusion of either 20% Intralipid plus <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (INT) (5 microl/min plus <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, 0.1 U/min; n = 8), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30823">oleate</z:chebi> (OLE) (1.3 microEq/min; n = 6), saline (SAL) (n = 6), or bovine serum albumin (BSA) (vehicle for OLE; n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because there was no difference in any of the parameters between BSA and SAL rats, these groups were combined as control rats (CONT) (n = 11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the end of the 48-h OLE/INT/CONT infusions, after an overnight fast, plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was clamped for 2 h at 13 mmol/l and for another 2 h at 22 mmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Preclamp plasma FFAs were elevated twofold (P &lt; 0.01) versus CONT with both INT and OLE (NS, INT vs. OLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Preclamp <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels were higher in INT than in CONT rats (P &lt; 0.05), suggesting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, but they were not different in OLE and CONT rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The insulin and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> responses to the rise in plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> from basal to 13 mmol/l were lower in OLE (336 +/- 72 pmol/l and 1.2 +/- 0.1 nmol/l, P &lt; 0.01 and P &lt; 0.05, respectively) than in CONT (552 +/- 54 and 1.9 +/- 0.1) rats, but they were not different between CONT and INT rats (648 +/- 150 and 2.0 +/- 0.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The insulin and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> responses to the rise in plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> from 13 to 22 mmol/l were lower in both INT (1,188 +/- 204 pmol/l and 3.0 +/- 0.3 nmol/l, P &lt; 0.01 and P &lt; 0.001) and OLE (432 +/- 60 and 1.7 +/- 0.2, P &lt; 0.001 vs. CONT or INT) rats than in CONT rats (1,662 +/- 174 and 5.0 +/- 0.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In summary, 1) both INT and OLE decreased GSIS in vivo in rats, and 2) the impairing effect of INT on GSIS was less than that of OLE, which might be due to the different type of fatty acid (mostly polyunsaturated in INT versus monounsaturated as OLE) and/or to differential effects of INT and OLE on insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, prolonged elevation of plasma FFAs can desensitize the insulin secretory response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in vivo, thus inducing a beta-cell defect that is similar to that found in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
