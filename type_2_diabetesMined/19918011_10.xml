<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>Low birth weight</z:hpo> is also associated with a higher <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to examine to what extent the evolution of body shape, from childhood to adulthood, is related to incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in late adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Etude Epidemiologique de Femmes de la Mutuelle Générale de l'Education Nationale (E3N) is a cohort study of French women born in 1925-1950 and followed by questionnaire every 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At baseline, in 1990, women were asked to report their current weight, height, and body silhouette at various ages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Birth weight was recorded in 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were self-reported or obtained by drug reimbursement record linkage and further validated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 91,453 women who were nondiabetic at baseline, 2,534 developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> over the 15 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Birth weight and body silhouette at 8 years, at menarche, and in young adulthood (20-25 years) were inversely associated with the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, independently of adult BMI during follow-up (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P(trend) &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In mid-adulthood (35-40 years), the association was reversed, with an increase in risk related to a larger body silhouette </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An increase in body silhouette from childhood to mid-adulthood amplified the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>Low birth weight</z:hpo> and thinness until young adulthood may increase the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, independently of adult BMI during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Young women who were lean children should be especially warned against <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
