<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Altogether 10,149 individuals at high risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were identified with the Finnish <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Risk Score (FINDRISC; scoring ≥15 points), by a history of impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (IFG) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> mellitus in 400 primary health care centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One-year follow-up data were available for 2,798 participants who were nondiabetic at baseline (919 men and 1,879 women, aged 56.0 ± 9.9 and 54.0 ± 10.7 years [mean ± SD] with BMI 30.9 ± 4.6 and 31.6 ± 5.4 kg/m(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 2.0 and 1.2% in men and women with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance at baseline, 13.5 and 7.4% in those with IFG, and 16.1 and 11.3% in those with IGT, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Altogether 17.5% of the subjects lost ≥ 5% weight with no sex difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relative risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 0.31 (95% CI 0.16-0.59) in the group who lost ≥ 5% weight, 0.72 (0.46-1.13) in the group who lost 2.5-4.9% weight, and 1.10 (0.77-1.58) in the group who gained ≥ 2.5% compared with the group who maintained weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The FIN-D2D was the first national effort to implement the prevention of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a primary health care setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Methods for recruiting high-risk subjects were simple and easy to use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> in this very high-risk group was especially effective in reducing risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among those participating in the program </plain></SENT>
