<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Up to now, only the functional properties of two MODY 1 HNF-4alpha mutants, Q268X and V393I, have been investigated to address how the mutations in the HNF-4alpha gene, found by genetic studies, can give rise to impaired activities of mutated HNF-4alpha proteins and can cause this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The E276Q mutation results in a nonconservative substitution occurring in the HNF-4alpha E domain, which is involved in dimerization and transactivation activities as well as in protein-protein interactions with other transcription factors or coactivators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using the mutated human HNF-4alpha2, we have found that, in the absence of chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor II (COUP TFII), the E276Q substitution does not significantly affect the dimerization and transactivating activities of HNF-4alpha, at least on the promoters studied herein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, in the presence of COUP TFII, the substitution impairs the enhancement of HNF-4-mediated activation of HNF-1 promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The impaired synergy between COUP TFII and HNF-4 on the HNF-1 promoter results from an alteration of their interaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HNF-1 expression plays a crucial role in transactivation of insulin promoter and of numerous genes coding for enzymes involved in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, its downregulation resulting from the E276Q mutation in HNF-4alpha gene most probably impairs the function of pancreatic beta-cells </plain></SENT>
