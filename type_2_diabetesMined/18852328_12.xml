<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of the study were to identify determinants of plasma RBP4 and RBP4 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and skeletal muscle and to investigate the association between RBP4 and in vivo measures of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study population included 298 elderly twins (aged 62-83 years), with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance ranging from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> to overt type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and 178 young (aged 25-32 years) and elderly (aged 58-66 years) nondiabetic twins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Peripheral and hepatic insulin sensitivity was assessed by a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp, and beta-cell function was estimated from an intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The influence of environmental versus genetic factors in the regulation of plasma RBP4 increased with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma RBP4 was elevated in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and increased with duration of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma RBP4 correlated inversely with peripheral, but not hepatic, insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the association disappeared after correction for covariates, including plasma adiponectin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50211">retinol</z:chebi>, and not RBP4, was inversely associated with insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SAT RBP4 expression correlated positively with GLUT4 expression and inversely with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Skeletal muscle RBP4 expression reflected intramuscular fat, and although it was suppressed by insulin, no association with insulin sensitivity was evident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RBP4 expression was not associated with circulatory RBP4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our data indicate that RBP4 levels in plasma, skeletal muscle, and fat may be linked to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a secondary and noncausal manner </plain></SENT>
