<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The antibody responses to a novel rapid-acting insulin analog, insulin aspart (IAsp), and their potential clinical correlates were studied with a specifically developed method in 2,420 people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treated for up to 1 year with preprandial subcutaneous injections of IAsp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Circulating insulin antibodies were analyzed by radioimmunoassay with (125)I insulin or IAsp tracers and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="46793">polyethylene glycol</z:chebi> precipitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four multinational, open, parallel group studies were conducted in Europe and North America, with a total of 1,534 people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> exposed to IAsp and 886 people exposed to human insulin (HI) as meal-related insulin for 6-12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Insulin antibodies specific to HI or IAsp were absent in a majority of patients throughout the 6- to 12-month study periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A majority of the patients (64-68%) had antibodies cross-reacting between HI and IAsp when entering the studies, with baseline levels (means +/- SD of percent bound/total) of 16.6 +/- 16.3% in study 1 and 10.3 +/- 14.0% in study 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four studies, cross-reactive antibodies increased in patients exposed to IAsp, with a maximum at 3 months, and thereafter there was a decline toward baseline levels at 9-12 months (levels at 3 and 12 months: 22.3 +/- 19.7 and 16.8 +/- 16.5% in study 1 and 21.5 +/- 21.9 and 16.9 +/- 17.4% in study 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Antibody levels showed similar changes in people with type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and there was no consistent relationship between antibody formation and glycemic control or between antibody formation and safety in terms of adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with IAsp is associated with an increase in cross-reactive insulin antibodies, with a subsequent fall toward baseline values, without any indication of clinical relevance because no effect on efficacy or safety could be identified </plain></SENT>
