<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A randomized clinical trial was conducted at seven Veterans Affairs medical centers in 121 male patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> between the ages of 40 and 69 years receiving at least one injection of insulin per day and with HbA1c, levels of &gt; or =8% at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Weights, blood pressures, insulin use, and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring data were obtained at each visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">Lipid</z:chebi> levels were obtained at 0, 4, 8, and 12 months, and free and total insulin levels were obtained at 0, 6, and 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> medications being taken were recorded at each visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No difference in absolute blood pressure, neither systolic nor diastolic, was seen between patients receiving <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53218">MDI</z:chebi> or IIP therapy, but significantly more <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53218">MDI</z:chebi> patients required anti-hypertensive medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When blood pressure was modeled against weight and time, IIP therapy was significantly better than <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53218">MDI</z:chebi> therapy for systolic blood pressure in patients with BMI &lt;33 and for diastolic blood pressure in patients with BMI &gt;34 kg/m2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Total cholesterol levels decreased in the overall sample, but IIP patients exhibited significantly higher levels than <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53218">MDI</z:chebi> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">Triglyceride</z:chebi> levels increased over time for both groups, with IIP patients having significantly higher levels than patients in the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53218">MDI</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>BMI was a significant predictor of, and inversely proportional to, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No difference in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering drug therapy was seen between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Free insulin and insulin antibodies tended to decrease in the IIP group as compared with the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53218">MDI</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels decreased in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: IIP therapy in insulin-requiring patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> has advantages over <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53218">MDI</z:chebi> therapy in decreasing the requirement for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> therapy and for decreasing total and free insulin and insulin antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Both therapies reduce total cholesterol and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
