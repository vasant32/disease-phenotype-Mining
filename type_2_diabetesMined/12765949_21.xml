<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, insulin activation of muscle <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase (GS) is impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This defect plays a major role for the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In animal muscle, insulin activates GS by reducing phosphorylation at both NH(2)- and COOH-terminal sites, but the mechanism involved in human muscle and the defect in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied the effect of insulin at physiological concentrations on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism, insulin signaling and phosphorylation of GS in skeletal muscle from type 2 diabetic and well-matched control subjects during euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis using phospho-specific antibodies revealed that insulin decreases phosphorylation of sites 3a + 3b in human muscle, and this was accompanied by activation of Akt and inhibition of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase kinase-3alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In type 2 diabetic subjects these effects of insulin were fully intact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite that, insulin-mediated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal and storage were reduced and activation of GS was virtually absent in type 2 diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Insulin did not decrease phosphorylation of sites 2 + 2a in healthy human muscle, whereas in diabetic muscle insulin infusion in fact caused a marked increase in the phosphorylation of sites 2 + 2a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This phosphorylation abnormality likely caused the impaired GS activation and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> storage, thereby contributing to skeletal muscle <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, and may therefore play a pathophysiological role in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
