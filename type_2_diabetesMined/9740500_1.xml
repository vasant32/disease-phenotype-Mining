<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The results of various studies suggest that hypertriglyceridaemia is associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is unclear, however, which particular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> (TG)-rich <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> contribute to the risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Different types of TG-rich <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> differ in function, composition, size and density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TG-rich <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> in the range Svedberg flotation (Sf) 12-60 have been shown to be associated with angiographic severity in both diabetic and non-diabetic individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A study in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> found that those with moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> had higher levels of both Sf 12 60 and Sf 60-400 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that this association was independent of both low (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>)- and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The association was not seen in patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, suggesting that these <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> may only be involved in the early stages of atherogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further research has indicated that the risk correlates positively to the postprandial levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B48 in the Sf 20-60 fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This suggests that elevated levels of chylomicron remnants are involved in progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
