<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of intrarenal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> in the pathogenesis of nonalbuminuric <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal insufficiency</z:hpo> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 325 unselected clinic patients who had sufficient clinical and biochemical information to calculate an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using the Modified Diet in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Renal Disease</z:e> six-variable formula, at least two estimations of urinary albumin excretion rates (AER), and a renal duplex scan to estimate the resistance index of the interlobar renal arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The resistance index, measured as part of a complications surveillance program, was compared in patients with an eGFR &lt; or &gt;or=60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) who were further stratified into normo- (AER &lt;20), micro- (20-200), or macroalbuminuria (&gt; 200 microg/min) categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with an eGFR &lt;60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) had a higher resistance index of the renal interlobar arteries compared with patients with an eGFR &gt;or=60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the resistance index was elevated to a similar extent in patients with an eGFR &lt;60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) regardless of albuminuric status (normo- 0.74 +/- 0.01, micro- 0.73 +/- 0.01, and macroalbuminuria resistance index 0.75 +/- 0.11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multiple regression analysis revealed that increased age (P &lt; 0.0001), elevated BMI (P = 0.0001), decreased eGFR (P &lt; 0.01), and decreased diastolic blood pressure (P &lt; 0.01), but not an increased AER, were independently associated with an elevated resistance index in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>impaired renal function</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and reduced glomerular filtration rate had similar degrees of intrarenal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e>, as measured by the intrarenal arterial resistance index, regardless of their AER status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pathological mechanisms that determine the relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>impaired renal function</z:hpo> and AER status in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> remain to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
