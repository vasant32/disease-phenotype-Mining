<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast, mutational loads of &gt;30% of mtDNA are associated with electron transport chain defects that result in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> diseases such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0006789'>mitochondrial encephalopathy</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003128'>lactic acidosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002401'>stroke-like episodes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pancreatic beta-cells may be extremely sensitive to the accumulation of mtDNA mutations, as insulin secretion requires the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> oxidation of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> arises when beta-cells fail to compensate for the increased demand for insulin, and many type 2 diabetics progress to insulin dependence because of a loss of beta-cell function or beta-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This loss of beta-cell function/beta-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> has been attributed to the toxic effects of elevated levels of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> resulting in the enhanced production of free radicals in beta-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>mtDNA, localized in close proximity to one of the major cellular sites of free radical production, comprises more than 95% coding sequences such that mutations result in changes in the coding sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It has long been known that mtDNA mutations accumulate with age; however, only recently have studies examined the influence of somatic mtDNA mutation accumulation on disease pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This article will focus on the effects of low-level somatic mtDNA mutation accumulation on ageing, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
