<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Studies in <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> diabetic fatty rats have led to the concept that chronically elevated free fatty acid (FFA) levels can cause <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>-laden pancreatic beta-cells as a result of the formation of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramides</z:chebi>, which induce nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO)-dependent cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This "lipotoxicity" hypothesis could explain development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study examines whether prolonged exposure to FFA affects survival of isolated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rat beta-cells and whether the outcome is related to the occurrence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> accumulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A dose-dependent cytotoxicity was detected at 5-100 nmol/l of unbound <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30823">oleate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi>, with <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> occurring within 48 h and an additional <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> during the subsequent 6 days of culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At equimolar concentrations, the cytotoxicity of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> was higher than that of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30823">oleate</z:chebi> but lower than that of its nonmetabolized analog bromopalmitate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FFA cytotoxicity was not suppressed by etomoxir (an inhibitor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi> palmitoyltransferase I) or by <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi>; it was not associated with inducible NO synthase expression or NO formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An inverse correlation was observed between the percentage of dead beta-cells on day 8 and their cellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> content on day 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For equimolar concentrations of the tested FFA, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30823">oleate</z:chebi> caused the lowest beta-cell toxicity and the highest cytoplasmic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> accumulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30823">oleate</z:chebi> exerted the highest toxicity in islet non-beta-cells, where no FFA-induced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> accumulation was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conditions without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> accumulation, the lower FFA concentrations caused primarily <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, both in islet beta-cells and non-beta-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that FFAs can cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rat islet cells through an NO-independent mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The ability of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> beta-cells to form and accumulate cytoplasmic <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> might serve as a cytoprotective mechanism against FFA-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by preventing a cellular rise in toxic free fatty acyl moieties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is conceivable that this potential is lost or insufficient in cells with a prolonged <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> accumulation as may occur in vivo </plain></SENT>
