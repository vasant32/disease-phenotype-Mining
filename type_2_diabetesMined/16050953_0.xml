<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: The two major incretin hormones--glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent insulinotropic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (GIP)--are being actively researched by the pharmaceutical industry because of their <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering and potential anti-diabetic properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, the inactivation of GLP-1 and GIP in the circulation brought about by dipeptidyl-peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) degradation makes their biological actions short-lived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study directly compares the cellular and biological properties of GLP-1, GIP and their N-terminally modified counterparts, with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30911">glucitol</z:chebi> extension at positions His7 and Tyr1 respectively, to confer DPP-IV resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using both the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-responsive pancreatic beta-cell line, BRIN BD11, and the <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> diabetic (ob/ob) mouse, we assessed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17489">adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate</z:chebi> (cAMP) production and insulinotropic action in vitro as well as in vivo <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering and insulin-releasing actions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results reveal that glycation of the N-terminus of GLP-1 or GIP stabilized both <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> against DPP-IV degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30911">glucitol</z:chebi>-GLP-1 displayed reduced cAMP production, insulinotropic activity and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering potency, compared to native GLP-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By contrast, N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30911">glucitol</z:chebi>-GIP exhibited substantially improved biological activities, compared to native GIP, and possessed similar or enhanced in vivo potency to GLP-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>N-terminal extension by means of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30911">glucitol</z:chebi> addition is more beneficial to bioactivity of GIP than it is to GLP-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: N-terminal glycation generates a super GIP <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, which possesses <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> in vivo <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering and insulinotropic actions superior to native GLP-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30911">glucitol</z:chebi>-GIP is a particularly attractive potential candidate molecule for drug therapy of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
