<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> surgery-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> on transcription factor 7-like 2 gene (TCF7L2) alternative splicing in adipose tissue and liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we determined the association of TCF7L2 splicing with the levels of plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and serum free fatty acids (FFAs) in three independent studies (n = 216) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Expression of the short <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> variant, lacking exons 12, 13, and 13a, decreased after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> in subcutaneous fat (n = 46) and liver (n = 11) and was more common in subcutaneous fat of subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than in subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals (n = 54) and a population-based sample (n = 49) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, there was a positive correlation between this variant and the level of fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in nondiabetic individuals (n = 113) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This association between TCF7L2 splicing and plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was independent of the TCF7L2 genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, this variant was associated with high levels of serum FFAs during <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo>, suggesting impaired insulin action in adipose tissue, whereas no association with insulin secretion or insulin-stimulated whole-body <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our study shows that the short TCF7L2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> variant in subcutaneous fat is regulated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> and impaired insulin action in adipose tissue </plain></SENT>
