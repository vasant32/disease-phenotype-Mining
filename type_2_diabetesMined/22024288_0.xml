<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate circulating visfatin and vaspin levels in first-degree relatives of subjects with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (FDRs) who frequently have higher value of HOMA-IR and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta cell dysfunction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serum visfatin and vaspin concentrations were measured in 179 Iranian subjects (90 normoglycemic FDRs and 89 age- and sex-matched healthy controls) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULT: Serum visfatin levels were significantly lower in the FDRs when compared to the controls (1.71±0.93 ng/ml versus 2.69±2.02 ng/ml, p=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, no significant difference was found in serum vaspin concentrations between the FDRs and the controls (0.452±0.254 ng/ml versus 0.409±0.275 ng/ml, p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In multiple logistic regression analysis, the FDRs showed a significant association with lower visfatin levels after adjustments for age, sex, Body Mass Index, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile, blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels and HOMA-IR [odds ratios (OR)=1.71, 95% confidence interval (1.30-2.25); p&lt;0.0001] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The FDRs showed a significant association with lower visfatin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The observed lower circulating visfatin levels in FDRs may suggest a pathophysiological role for visfatin in <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta cell dysfunction</z:hpo> in this group </plain></SENT>
