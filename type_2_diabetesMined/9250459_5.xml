<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 171 Pima Indians with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> between the ages of 30-70 years in a population-based epidemiological survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasma PAI-1 activity was measured by a spectrophotometric assay and PAI-1 4G/5G promoter genotype by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using allele-specific primers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>Retinopathy</z:hpo> was assessed by ophthalmoscopy after pupillary dilation and classified as any <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> or as nonproliferative and proliferative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>Retinopathy</z:hpo> was present in 70 (41%) subjects, and 4 (2.3%) subjects had proliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma PAI-1 activity was not significantly different among subjects with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (17.1 +/- vs. 19.7 +/- 9.1 arbitrary units (AU)/ml, P = 0.09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PAI-1 activity was negatively correlated with duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (rs = -0.18, P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a logistic regression analysis controlled for age, sex, BMI, and duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, any <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> was significantly associated with fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations (P &lt; 0.05), 2-h postload <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (P = 0.02), and HbA1c (P = 0.008), but not with PAI-1 activity (P = 0.48) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> in the three genotype groups differed significantly (4G/4G, 4G/5G, and 5G/5G were 44, 49, and 24%, respectively; chi 2 = 8.22, df = 2, P = 0.016) and remained significant after controlling for age, sex, BMI, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, and urine albumin-to-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> ratio in a logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The odds ratios for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> in subjects with 4G/4G and 4G/5G, compared with the 5G/5G genotype, were 2.0 and 3.1, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> in Pima Indians with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is not associated with PAI-1 activity, subjects with the 4G/4G and 4G/5G genotype had a higher prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> compared with 5G/5G PAI-1genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These preliminary findings indicate that in Pima Indians with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, presence of the 4G allele of the PAI-1 gene was associated with a higher risk of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
