<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treated with insulin glargine or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> as add-on therapy to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: HRQOL was evaluated in 217 subjects uncontrolled with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, enrolled in a 24-week, multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group trial of add-on insulin glargine versus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 40-item, self-administered questionnaire at baseline and at weeks 2, 6, 12, 18, and 24 was given, including the 34-item <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Symptom Checklist-Revised (DSC-R), a 5-item mental health scale from the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), and a single-item health rating from the SF-36 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These assessments do not specify route of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both treatment groups showed similar improvements in glycemic control from baseline to week 24 (change in A1C: -1.66% in the insulin glargine group, -1.51% in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> group, P = 0.1446) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both groups also showed improvement in HRQOL, although subjects treated with insulin glargine experienced significantly greater improvements compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> in the DSC-R total symptom score (P = 0.005), total symptom distress score (P = 0.03), individual domain scores for mood symptoms (P = 0.007), ophthalmologic symptoms (P = 0.007), ophthalmologic distress (P = 0.013), <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> distress (P = 0.033), and SF-36 perception of general health (P = 0.047) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although addition of insulin glargine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> achieved comparable improvements in glycemic control, insulin glargine was associated with greater improvements in HRQOL, indicating that other factors (e.g., safety profile and nonglycemic actions) may further enhance HRQOL in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
