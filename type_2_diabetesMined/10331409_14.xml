<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine whether glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (GLP)-1 increases insulin sensitivity in addition to stimulating insulin secretion, we studied totally depancreatized dogs to eliminate GLP-1's incretin effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Somatostatin was infused (0.8 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1)) to inhibit extrapancreatic glucagon in dogs, and basal glucagon was restored by intraportal infusion (0.65 ng x kg(-1) x min(-1)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To simulate the residual intraportal insulin secretion in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, basal intraportal insulin infusion was given to obtain plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations of approximately 10 mmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> was clamped at this level for the remainder of the experiment, which included peripheral insulin infusion (high dose, 5.4 pmol x kg(-1) x min(-1), or low dose, 0.75 pmol x kg(-1) x min(-1)) with or without GLP-1(7-36) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29337,32988">amide</z:chebi> (1.5 pmol x kg(-1) x min(-1)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> production and utilization were measured with 3-[3H]<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, using radiolabeled <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 12 paired experiments with six dogs at the high insulin dose, GLP-1 infusion resulted in higher <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> requirements than saline (60.9+/-11.0 vs. 43.6+/-8.3 micromol x kg(-1) x min(-1), P&lt; 0.001), because of greater <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization (72.6+/-11.0 vs. 56.8+/-9.7 micromol x kg(-1) x min(-1), P&lt;0.001), whereas the suppression of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production was not affected by GLP-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Free fatty acids (FFAs) were significantly lower with GLP-1 than saline (375.3+/-103.0 vs. 524.4+/-101.1 micromol/l, P&lt;0.01), as was <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> (77.9+/-17.5 vs. 125.6+/-51.8 micromol/l, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>GLP-1 receptor gene expression was found using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction of poly(A)-selected <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> in muscle and adipose tissue, but not in liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Low levels of GLP-1 receptor gene expression were also found in adipose tissue using Northern blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 10 paired experiments with five dogs at the low insulin dose, GLP-1 infusion did not affect <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization or FFA and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> suppression when compared with saline, suggesting that GLP-1's effect on insulin action was dependent on the insulin dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, in depancreatized dogs, GLP-1 potentiates insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization, an effect that might be contributed in part by GLP-1 potentiation of insulin's antilipolytic action </plain></SENT>
