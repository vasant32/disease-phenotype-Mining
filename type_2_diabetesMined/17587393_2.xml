<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Double-blind, double-dummy, multicentre study extended to a total of 52 weeks </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After the initial 6-month study, the majority of patients in the nateglinide group [n = 112 (93.3%)] and in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi> group [n = 101 (92.7%)] entered a 6-month, double-blind, extension study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no significant difference between treatment regimens in <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> Alc (HbA1c) change from baseline to 52 weeks (-0.14% for nateglinide vs. -0.27% for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi>; p = 0.396) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Proportions of patients achieving an endpoint HbA1c of &lt;7% were similar (40 vs. 47.4%) for nateglinide and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant between-treatment difference in fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> change from baseline to 52 weeks (nateglinide: -0.2 mmol/l and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi>: -0.7 mmol/l; p = 0.096) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The decreases in prandial plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> area under the curve(0-4 h) from baseline were -3.26 and -1.86 h x mmol/l in the nateglinide and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi> groups respectively, and the change was statistically significant in the nateglinide group only (p = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Initial insulin response to a meal was augmented with nateglinide treatment only, without between-treatment difference in 2-h insulin response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The overall rate of hypoglycaemic events was similar with nateglinide and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi> combinations with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Treatment with nateglinide plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> for up to 12 months was not associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
