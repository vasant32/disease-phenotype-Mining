<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adults, a small (catalytic) dose of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28757">fructose</z:chebi> administered with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> decreases the glycemic response to a <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> load, especially in those with the poorest <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> catalytic dose of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28757">fructose</z:chebi> would also improve <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance in individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Five adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> underwent an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) on two separate occasions, at least 1 week apart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each OGTT consisted of 75 g <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> with or without the addition of 7.5 g <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28757">fructose</z:chebi> (OGTT + F or OGTT - F), in random order </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Arterialized blood samples were collected from a heated dorsal hand vein twice before ingestion of the carbohydrate and every 15 min for 3 h afterward </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The area under the curve (AUC) of the plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> response was reduced by <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28757">fructose</z:chebi> administration in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects; the mean AUC during the OGTT + F was 14% less than that during the OGTT - F (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The insulin AUC was decreased 21% with <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28757">fructose</z:chebi> administration (P = 0.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasma glucagon concentrations declined similarly during OGTT - F and OGTT + F </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incremental AUC of the blood <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> response during the OGTT - F was approximately 50% of that observed during the OGTT + F (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neither nonesterified fatty acid nor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> concentrations differed between the two OGTTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28757">fructose</z:chebi> improves the glycemic response to an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> load in adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and this effect is not a result of stimulation of insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
