<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although there is abundant evidence that hyperglucagonaemia plays a key role in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, efforts to understand and correct this abnormality have been overshadowed by the emphasis on insulin secretion and action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, recognition that the incretin hormone glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) exerts opposing effects on glucagon and insulin secretion has revived interest in glucagon, the neglected partner of insulin, in the bihormonal hypothesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In healthy subjects, glucagon secretion is regulated by a variety of nutrient, neural and hormonal factors, the most important of which is <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The defect in alpha cell function that occurs in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> reflects impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> sensing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>GLP-1 inhibits glucagon secretion in vitro and in vivo in experimental animals, and suppresses glucagon release in a <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent manner in healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This effect is also evident in diabetic patients, but GLP-1 does not inhibit glucagon release in response to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e>, and may even enhance it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Early clinical studies with agents acting through GLP-1 signalling mechanisms (e.g. exenatide, liraglutide and vildagliptin) suggest that GLP-1 can improve alpha cell <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> sensing in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic approaches based around GLP-1 have the potential to improve both alpha cell and beta cell function, and could be of benefit in patients with a broad range of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
