<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial conducted at seven practices in central North Carolina, 200 African-American women, &gt; or =40 years of age with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, were randomized to one of three treatment conditions: clinic and community (group A), clinic only (group B), or minimal intervention (group C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinic-based intervention (groups A and B) consisted of four monthly visits with a nutritionist who provided counseling to enhance PA and dietary intake that was tailored to baseline practices and attitudes; the community-based intervention (group A) consisted of three group sessions and 12 monthly phone calls from a peer counselor and was designed to provide social support and reinforce behavior change goals; and the minimal intervention (group C) consisted of educational pamphlets mailed to participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary study outcome was the comparison of PA levels between groups assessed at 6 and 12 months by accelerometer, which was worn while awake for 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Totals of 175 (88%) and 167 (84%) participants completed PA assessment at 6 and 12 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For comparison of PA, the P value for overall group effect was 0.014 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparing group A with C, the difference in the average adjusted mean for PA was 44.1 kcal/day (95% CI 13.1-75.1, P = 0.0055) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Comparing group B with C, the difference in the average adjusted mean was 33.1 kcal/day (95% CI 3.3-62.8, P = 0.029) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The intervention was acceptable to participants: 88% were very satisfied with clinic-based counseling to enhance PA, and 86% indicated that the peer counselor's role in the program was important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The intervention was associated with a modest enhancement of PA and was acceptable to participants </plain></SENT>
