<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> has emerged as a prominent factor in the type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> pathoetiology, but it remains ill-defined in type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is a wide spectrum of associations between <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory responses</z:mp> and diabetic syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At one end of this spectrum, there is type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for which there is convincing evidence that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> of pancreatic islets is a central aspect of disease pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the opposite end, is type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> that is clearly associated with systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, which could be either the cause or simply mark the underlying pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Accumulating evidence has substantiated that a subgroup of adult patients clinically diagnosed with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> exhibit autoantibody responses to islet autoantigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of these immunologic abnormalities is associated with a severe insulin secretory defect and the absence of signs of systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> as documented by plasma C-reactive protein and fibrinogen levels that are comparable with those of control populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Islet autoantibody evaluation should be part of the diagnostic assessment for clinically diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> not only because it might predict the rate of progression to insulin requirement in adult populations but also to identify a pathogenically distinct disease phenotype characterized by the absence of systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and its related disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A more appropriate characterization of this subgroup of clinically diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> of autoimmune pathogenesis, will promote future research into the etiology, natural history, and treatment </plain></SENT>
