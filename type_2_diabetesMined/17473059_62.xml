<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We examined the associations of objectively measured sedentary time, light-intensity physical activity, and moderate- to vigorous-intensity activity with fasting and 2-h postchallenge plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in Australian adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 67 men and 106 women (mean age +/- SD 53.3 +/- 11.9 years) without diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were recruited from the 2004-2005 Australian <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo>, and Lifestyle (AusDiab) study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Physical activity was measured by Actigraph accelerometers worn during waking hours for 7 consecutive days and summarized as sedentary time (accelerometer counts/min &lt;100; average hours/day), light-intensity (counts/min 100-1951), and moderate- to vigorous-intensity (counts/min &gt; or =1,952) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test was used to ascertain 2-h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After adjustment for confounders (including waist circumference), sedentary time was positively associated with 2-h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (b = 0.29, 95% CI 0.11-0.48, P = 0.002); light-intensity activity time (b = -0.25, -0.45 to -0.06, P = 0.012) and moderate- to vigorous-intensity activity time (b = -1.07, -1.77 to -0.37, P = 0.003) were negatively associated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Light-intensity activity remained significantly associated with 2-h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> following further adjustment for moderate- to vigorous-intensity activity (b = -0.22, -0.42 to -0.03, P = 0.023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Associations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> activity measures with fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> were nonsignificant (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data provide the first objective evidence that light-intensity physical activity is beneficially associated with blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and that sedentary time is unfavorably associated with blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These objective data support previous findings from studies using self-report measures, and suggest that substituting light-intensity activity for television viewing or other sedentary time may be a practical and achievable preventive strategy to reduce the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
