<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In Australia 7.4% of people over 25 years of age have <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (mostly type 2) and comparable or higher prevalences have been reported in the United States and a number of Asian countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The enormous economic and social cost of this disease makes a compelling case for prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Epidemiological studies have shown clearly that type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> results from an interaction between a genetic predisposition and lifestyle factors including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, sedentary behaviour and both calorie excess and various dietary constituents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The natural history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> includes a preceding period of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT)/impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (IFG) which provides an opportunity for targeted intervention within large communities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lifestyle intervention studies have consistently shown that quite modest changes can reduce the progression from IGT to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by 50-60% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It may, however, not be possible to translate these successful findings to larger cohorts or maintain the lifestyle changes longer term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This has lead to consideration of pharmacotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>While small studies with sulphonylureas are inconclusive, benefits have been found for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Big intervention studies with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8774">ramipril</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9927">valsartan</z:chebi> and nateglinide are underway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pharmacological intervention raises a whole range of ethical, economic and practical issues not the least of which is the problem of long term therapy of the 'otherwise well' </plain></SENT>
