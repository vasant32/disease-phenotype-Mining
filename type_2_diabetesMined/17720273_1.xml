<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study, of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> patients, treated in a referral community setting, was to follow the history of weight changes, in relation to the changing treatment modalities, and to detect independent risk factor and predictors for <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH METHODS: 366 outpatients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2DM) were followed longitudinally for at least 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>310 patients were treated with oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi> and 56 patients had insulin treatment added to the oral therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The two groups did no differ significantly in the duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> and admission HbA1c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean weight at admission was 78.9+/-15.1 and 76.7+/-15.0 kg (ns) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant weight changes were noted on initiation of oral treatment and at final visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The commencing of insulin therapy was the only step associated with a significant 3.7 kg increase in body weight (p&lt;0.001) with a significant reduction in HbA1c (-1.4%, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These changes however, followed a decrease in body weight that preceded insulin therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean weight at follow-up did not exceed the self-reported weight prior to the diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The results show that <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> does not necessarily accompany treatment of T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Insulin therapy in T2DM is associated with some <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>, mostly due to correction of glycemia and improvement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> prior to insulin treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This should encourage the timely addition and combining of appropriate therapeutic modalities in order to achieve good glycemic control </plain></SENT>
