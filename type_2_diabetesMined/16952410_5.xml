<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: High sensitivity CRP levels were measured in 620 Aboriginal participants aged 20-74 years free from <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at baseline in a remote community in the Northern Territory of Australia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants were followed for a median of 11 years to identify newly diagnosed cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the relationship of CRP levels with the risk of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> over the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 109 participants were newly diagnosed with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Incident rates were 10.8, 16.6 and 28.8 per 1000 person-years for people in the lower, middle and upper tertile groups of baseline CRP levels, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for age, sex, BMI, baseline <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> regulation status, total cholesterol, urine albumin to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio, systolic blood pressure, smoking and alcohol drinking, the association between <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and CRP remained significant, with a hazard ratio of 1.23 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05, 1.45) corresponding to a doubling in CRP values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the adjusted hazard ratio for development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in people in the upper tertile versus the bottom two tertiles of CRP was 1.75 (95% CI 1.19, 2.56) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CRP is independently associated with the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Aboriginal people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings support a role of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in the etiology of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the high risk population of Aboriginal Australians </plain></SENT>
