<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To compare two progressive approaches [once-daily insulin glargine plus ≤3 mealtime lispro (G+L) vs. insulin lispro mix 50/50 (LM50/50) progression once up to thrice daily (premix progression, PP)] of beginning and advancing insulin in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2D) and inadequate glycaemic control on oral therapy, with the aim of showing non-inferiority of PP to G+L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were randomized to PP (n = 242) or G+L (n = 242) in a 36-week, multinational, open-label trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dinnertime insulin LM 50/50 could be replaced with insulin lispro mix 75/25 if needed for fasting glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Baseline <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA1c) were 9.5% (PP) and 9.3% (G+L); p = 0.095 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Change in A1C (baseline to endpoint) was -1.76% (PP) and -1.93% (G+L) (p = 0.097) [between-group difference of 0.17 (95% confidence interval: -0.03, 0.37)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Non-inferiority of PP to G+L was not shown based on the prespecified non-inferiority margin of 0.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A1C was lower with G+L at weeks 12 (7.8 vs. 7.9%; p = 0.042), 24 (7.4 vs. 7.6%; p = 0.046), but not at week 36 (7.5 vs. 7.6%; p = 0.405) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in percentages of patients achieving A1C ≤7%, overall <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> incidence and rate or weight change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Total daily insulin dosages at endpoint were higher with PP vs. G+L (0.57 vs. 0.51 U/kg; p = 0.017), likely due to more injections (1.98 vs. 1.79; p = 0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Both treatments progressively improved glycaemic control in patients with T2D on oral therapy, although non-inferiority of PP to G+L was not shown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Higher insulin doses were observed with PP with no between-treatment differences in overall <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> or <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
