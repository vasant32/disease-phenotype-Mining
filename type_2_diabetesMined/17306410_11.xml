<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We used Oman's 1991 National <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Survey data (n=4881) to develop a simple <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk score for identification of individuals at high risk of having <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The logistic regression model used included age, waist circumference, body mass index, family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> status at the time of the survey for individuals aged &gt; or =20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The validity of the model was assessed in another cohort (2001 Nizwa study n=1432) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On applying this model to both cohorts, the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve was 0.83 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82-0.84) for the 1991 cohort and 0.76 (95%CI 0.74-0.79) for the 2001 cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Risk Score of &gt;10 was depicted as the optimal cut-point to predict <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosed by serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &gt; or =11.1 mmol/L 2-h post 75 g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> load </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This score had a sensitivity of 78.6 and 62.8% and specificity of 73.4 and 78.2% in the two cohorts, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Test of the Thai, Dutch, Finnish and Danish <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk scores showed poor performance of these models among Omani Arabs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In comparison, the self-administered <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk score of Oman could identify most individuals at high risk of having type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in community-based settings in Oman </plain></SENT>
