<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Single nucleotide polymorphisms in MTNR1B (rs10830963), G6PC2 (rs560887), and GCK (rs4607517) were genotyped in 2,025 healthy European children aged 9-11 and 14-16 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Associations with fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, homeostasis model assessment (HOMA)-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (IR) and HOMA-B were investigated along with those observed for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> variants available in this study (CDKN2A/B, IGF2BP2, CDKAL1, SLC30A8, HHEX-IDE, and Chr 11p12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Strongest associations were observed for G6PC2 and MTNR1B, with mean fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels (95% CI) being 0.084 (0.06-0.11) mmol/l, P = 7.9 x 10(-11) and 0.069 (0.04-0.09) mmol/l, P = 1.9 x 10(-7) higher per risk allele copy, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A similar but weaker trend was observed for GCK (0.028 [-0.006 to 0.06] mmol/l, P = 0.11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three variants were associated with lower beta-cell function (HOMA-B P = 9.38 x 10(-5), 0.004, and 0.04, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SLC30A8 (rs13266634) was the only type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> variant associated with higher fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (0.033 mmol/l [0.01-0.06], P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Calculating a genetic predisposition score adding the number of risk alleles of G6PC2, MTNR1B, GCK, and SLC30A8 showed that <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were successively higher in children carrying a greater number of risk alleles (P = 7.1 x 10(-17)), with mean levels of 5.34 versus 4.91 mmol/l comparing children with seven alleles (0.6% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children) to those with none (0.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No associations were found for fasting insulin or HOMA-IR with any of the variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The effects of common polymorphisms influencing fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> are apparent in healthy children, whereas the presence of multiple risk alleles amounts to a difference of &gt;1 SD of fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
