<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 141 patients was recruited in this study and randomized into a cilostazol group and a placebo (control) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hundred and twenty patients completed the study (i.e. 60 on cilostazol and 60 on placebo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Biochemical profiles and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> of the common carotid artery (CCA) determined by high-resolution B-mode ultrasonography were measured at 0, 6, and 12 months after the oral administration of 100--200 mg of cilostazol or placebo (i.e. two or four times daily for 12 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical and biochemical characteristics, the treatment modality, and microvascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> after randomization were not significantly different between the two groups after the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the cilostazol treatment group, left CCA average <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> significantly decreased from 0.94+/-0.03 to 0.91+/-0.02 mm at 6 months (P&lt;0.05), and thereafter increased to 0.92+/-0.01 mm (P&gt;0.05) at 12 months, whereas in the control group, it increased from 0.92+/-0.03 to 0.93+/-0.01 mm at 6 months (P&gt;0.05), and to 0.94+/-0.01 mm at 12 months (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As for the right CCA average <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>, it decreased from 0.83+/-0.03 to 0.82+/-0.01 mm at 6 months (P&lt;0.05), and to 0.81+/-0.01 mm at 12 months (P&lt;0.05) in the cilostazol group, whereas it increased from 0.87+/-0.03 to 0.89+/-0.01 mm at 6 months (P&lt;0.05), and to 0.90+/-0.01 mm at 12 months (P&lt;0.05) in the control group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After correction for risk factors such as blood pressure, smoking, and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profiles, there were significant changes in left and right CCA average <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> for both groups (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Left and right CCA average <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> was significantly different between the two groups (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After making statistical corrections for blood pressure, smoking, and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profiles, the differences between these two groups remained significant (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, there were no differences between the groups in the change of risk factors such as BMI, blood pressure, blood sugar, HbA(1c), and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Generally, cilostazol was well tolerated and the most common side effect in the cilostazol group was <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (12/60), mostly early in the treatment regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that oral cilostazol may be helpful in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in type 2 diabetic patients, although conventional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> remained unmodified </plain></SENT>
