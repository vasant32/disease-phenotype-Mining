<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Insulin secretion is one of the functions mediated by CD38, a nonlineage pleiotropic cell surface receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The molecule is the target of an <z:mp ids='MP_0001844'>autoimmune response</z:mp>, because serum autoantibodies (aAbs) to CD38 have been detected in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the healthy Caucasian population, the CD38 gene is bi-allelic (86% CD38*B and 14% CD38*A), whereas an Arg140Trp mutation has been identified in Japanese diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the relationship between CD38 and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Caucasian patients by characterizing anti-CD38 aAbs in terms of prevalence and function (agonistic/nonagonistic activity) and by exploring the potential influence of the CD38 genetic background </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A novel enzymatic immunoassay, using recombinant soluble CD38 as the target antigen, was developed for the analysis of anti-CD38 aAb titers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sera from 19.15% of type 1 and 16.67% of type 2 diabetic patients were positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The majority of anti-CD38 aAbs (57.14%) displayed agonistic properties, i.e., they demonstrated the capability to trigger <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> release in lymphocytic cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In agreement with these functional features, the presence of anti-CD38 aAbs in type 2 diabetic patients was associated with significantly higher levels of fasting plasma C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> and insulin, as compared with anti-CD38-counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No diabetic subject carrying the Arg140Trp mutation and no preferential association between <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or aAb status and the CD38*A allele was found in the study population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results show the significance of anti-CD38 aAbs as a new diagnostic marker of beta-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the prevalent agonistic activity of these aAbs suggests that they could mediate relevant effects on target cells by means of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> mobilization </plain></SENT>
