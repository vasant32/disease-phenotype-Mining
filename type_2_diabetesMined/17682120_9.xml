<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article was to compare the effects of cod protein to those of other animal proteins on insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant human subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Insulin sensitivity (M/I) was assessed using a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp in 19 insulin-resistant subjects fed a cod protein diet and a similar diet containing lean beef, pork, veal, eggs, milk, and milk products (BPVEM) for 4 weeks in a crossover design study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both diets were formulated to differ only in protein source, thus providing equivalent amounts of dietary fibers and monounsaturated, polyunsaturated (including n-3), and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="26607">saturated fatty acids</z:chebi> (1.1:1.8:1.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Beta-cell function, estimated by oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test-derived parameters, was also assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a significant improvement in insulin sensitivity (P = 0.027) and a strong tendency for a better disposition index (beta-cell function x M/I) (P = 0.055) in subjects consuming the cod protein diet compared with those consuming the BPVEM diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When median baseline M/I (4.8 x 10(-3) mg x kg(-1) x min(-1) x pmol(-1)) was taken into account, an interaction on the 30-min C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-to-30-min <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> ratio, used as an index of beta-cell function, was observed between diet and M/I status (P = 0.022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Indeed, this ratio strongly tended to increase in subjects with low M/I consuming the cod protein diet compared with those consuming the BPVEM diet (P = 0.065) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Dietary cod protein improves insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant individuals and thus could contribute to prevention of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by reducing the metabolic complications related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
