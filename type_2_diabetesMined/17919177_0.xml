<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have subsequently found that collectrin, a recently cloned kidney-specific gene of unknown function, is a novel target of HNF-1alpha in pancreatic beta-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, we have demonstrated that collectrin forms a complex with the soluble <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44485">N-ethylmaleimide</z:chebi>-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex by direct interaction with snapin, a protein that is thought to be involved in neurotransmission by binding to synaptosomal-associated protein, 25 KD (SNAP25) </plain></SENT>
