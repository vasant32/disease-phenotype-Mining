<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about the correlation of sun exposure habits and type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A South Swedish cohort study comprising 1000 women from each age group between 25 and 64 (n=40,000) drawn from the Southern Swedish population registry 1990-1992 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the inception of the study 74% answered the inquiry (n=29,518) and provided detailed information on their sun exposure habits and other variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A follow-up inquiry was sent 2000-2002 which 24,098 women answered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up time was 11 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis was used and the main outcome was the relationship between type 2 DM and sun exposure habits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our findings indicated that women with active sun exposure habits were at a 30% lower risk of having DM, as compared to those with non-active habits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was an inverse relation between this risk reduction and BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our investigation gives possible epidemiological explanation to ethnic and seasonal differences in type 2 DM and metabolic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The study supports that sunlight is involved in the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
