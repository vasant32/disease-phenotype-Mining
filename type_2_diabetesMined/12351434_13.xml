<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Administration of adiponectin to rodents prevented diet-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>, suggesting a potential etiologic role of hypoadiponectinemia in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to prospectively examine whether low plasma adiponectin concentrations predict future <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> in Pima Indians, explaining the predictive effect of adiponectin on the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We measured plasma adiponectin concentrations in 219 nondiabetic Pima Indians (112 M/107 F, age 31 +/- 9 years, body weight 96 +/- 20 kg [mean +/- SD]) in whom body weight and height were measured and BMI calculated at baseline and follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cross-sectionally, plasma adiponectin concentrations were negatively associated with body weight (r = -0.28, P = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prospectively, plasma adiponectin concentrations at baseline were not associated with change in weight or BMI before or after adjustment for time of follow-up or after additional adjustment for age at follow-up and sex (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &gt; 0.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that low plasma adiponectin concentrations do not play an etiologic role in development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in Pima Indians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the predictive effect of low plasma adiponectin concentrations on the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> seems to be mediated by factors other than <z:mp ids='MP_0010024'>increased adiposity</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
