<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the effect of GV, blood pressure (BP), and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> on intima-media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>), left ventricular mass index (LVMI), flow-mediated dilation (FMD), and sympathovagal balance (low frequency [LF]/high frequency <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29228">[HF]</z:chebi> ratio) in 26 type 2 diabetic patients (<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration 4.41±4.81 years; HbA1c 6.70±1.25%) receiving diet and/or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> treatment, with no hypotensive treatment or complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Continuous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring (CGM) data were used to calculate mean amplitude of glycemic excursion (MAGE), continuous overall net glycemic action (CONGA)-2, mean blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (MBG), mean postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excursion (MPPGE), and incremental area under the curve (IAUC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure (BP), circadian rhythm, and urinary 15-F2t-isoprostane (8-iso-<z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> F2α [PGF2α]) were also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects were divided into dipper (D) and nondipper (ND) groups according to ΔBP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> and LVMI were increased in ND versus D (0.77±0.08 vs. 0.68±0.13 [P=0.04] and 67±14 vs. 55±11 [P=0.03], respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MBG, MAGE, and IAUC were significantly associated with LF/HF ratio at night (r=0.50, P=0.01; r=0.40, P=0.04; r=0.41, P=0.04, respectively), MPPGE was negatively associated with FMD (r=-0.45, P=0.02), and CONGA-2 was positively associated with LVMI (r=0.55, P=0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Δsystolic BP was negatively associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> (r=-0.43, P=0.03) and with LVMI (r=-0.52, P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Urinary 8-iso-PGF2α was positively associated with LVMI (r=0.68 P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: An impaired GV and BP variability is associated with endothelial and cardiovascular damage in short-term diabetic patients with optimal metabolic control </plain></SENT>
