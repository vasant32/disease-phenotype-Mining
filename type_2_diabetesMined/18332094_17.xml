<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>Peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (DPN) is not widely modeled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe unique features of DPN in type 2 diabetic <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We evaluated the structural, electrophysiological, behavioral, and molecular features of DPN in ZDF rats and littermates over 4 months of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The status of insulin signaling transduction molecules that might be interrupted in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and selected survival-, stress-, and pain-related molecules was emphasized in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) sensory neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ZDF rats developed slowing of motor sciatic-tibial and sensory sciatic digital conduction velocity and selective mechanical <z:mp ids='MP_0003177'>allodynia</z:mp> with preserved thermal algesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diabetic sural axons, preserved in number, developed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, but there was loss of large-calibre dermal and small-calibre epidermal axons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In diabetic rats, insulin signal transduction pathways in lumbar DRGs were preserved or had trends toward upregulation: <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of insulin receptor beta-subunit (IRbeta), insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1, and IRS-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The numbers of neurons expressing IRbeta protein were also preserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were trends toward early rises of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of heat shock protein 27 (HSP27), the alpha2delta1 calcium channel subunit, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Others were unchanged, including nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB; p50/p105) and receptor for advanced glycosylation endproducts (RAGE) as was the proportion of neurons expressing HSP27, NF-kappaB, and RAGE protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ZDF type 2 diabetic rats develop a distal degenerative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000763'>sensory neuropathy</z:hpo> accompanied by a selective long-term pain syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Neuronal insulin signal transduction molecules are preserved </plain></SENT>
