<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent studies using magnetic resonance spectroscopy have shown that decreased insulin-stimulated muscle <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthesis due to a defect in insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transport activity is a major factor in the pathogenesis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The molecular mechanism underlying defective insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transport activity can be attributed to increases in intramyocellular <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolites such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37554">fatty acyl CoAs</z:chebi> and diacylglycerol, which in turn activate a serine/threonine kinase cascade, thus leading to defects in insulin signaling through Ser/Thr phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A similar mechanism is also observed in hepatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> associated with nonalcoholic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>fatty liver</z:hpo>, which is a common feature of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, where increases in hepatocellular diacylglycerol content activate protein kinase C-epsilon, leading to reduced insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>More recently, magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies in healthy lean elderly subjects and healthy lean insulin-resistant offspring of parents with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have demonstrated that reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> function may predispose these individuals to intramyocellular <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> accumulation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further analysis has found that the reduction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> function in the insulin-resistant offspring can be mostly attributed to reductions in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By elucidating the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, these studies provide potential new targets for the treatment and prevention of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
