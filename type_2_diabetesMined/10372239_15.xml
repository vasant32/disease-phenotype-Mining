<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In 1,020 type 2 diabetic patients treated with diet or oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi> (OHAs), measurements of fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) and HbA1c were taken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 617 patients, the measurement could be repeated after 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cross-sectional correlation coefficients were calculated for the association between HbA1c and FPG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC)-curve analyses were applied to examine the performance of FPG as a diagnostic test for HbA1c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Longitudinally, the change in FPG was compared with the change in HbA1c, with both correlation measures and ROC curve analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Correlation coefficients between HbA1c and FPG and between FPG change and HbA1c change were 0.77 and 0.65, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ROC curve analysis showed that HbA1c is difficult to predict from FPG values: 66% of the patients with good HbA1c (&lt; 7.0%) were identified as such by FPG values &lt; 7.8 mmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As a test for HbA1c change, FPG change performed moderately: the highest combined values of sensitivity and specificity (87.7 and 57%, respectively) were reached at a cutoff point of zero in the range of FPG change values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: FPG and HbA1c values that do not correspond are not rare in type 2 diabetic patients on diet or OHA treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>HbA1c is difficult to predict from FPG values, and even more difficult is the prediction of HbA1c changes from FPG changes </plain></SENT>
