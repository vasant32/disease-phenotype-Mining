<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine whether diet and exercise improve insulin sensitivity and/or beta-cell function and to evaluate these effects over time, we quantified insulin sensitivity and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (AIRg) in 62 Japanese Americans (age 56.5 +/- 1.3 years; mean +/- SE) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) who were randomized to the American Heart Association (<z:chebi fb="30" ids="27777">AHA</z:chebi>) Step 2 diet plus endurance exercise (n = 30) versus the <z:chebi fb="30" ids="27777">AHA</z:chebi> Step 1 diet plus stretching (n = 32) for 24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>beta-Cell function (disposition index [DI]) was calculated as S(i) x AIRg, where S(i) is the insulin sensitivity index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incremental area under the curve for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (incAUCg) was calculated from a 75-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intra-abdominal fat (IAF) and subcutaneous fat (SCF) areas were measured by computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 24 months, the Step 2/endurance group had lower weight (63.1 +/- 2.4 vs. 71.3 +/- 2.9 kg; P = 0.004) and IAF (75.0 +/- 7.9 vs. 112.7 +/- 10.4 cm(2); P = 0.03) and SCF (196.5 +/- 18.0 vs. 227.7 +/- 19.9 cm(2); P &lt; 0.001) areas, greater S(i) (4.7 +/- 0.5 vs. 3.3 +/- 0.3 x 10(-5) min  </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the DI (P = 0.7) between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>S(i) was associated with changes in weight (r = -0.426, P = 0.001) and IAF (r = -0.395, P = 0.003) and SCF (r = -0.341, P = 0.01) areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, the lifestyle modifications <z:hpo ids='HP_0004325'>decreased weight</z:hpo> and central <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> and improved insulin sensitivity in Japanese Americans with IGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, such changes did not improve beta-cell function, suggesting that this degree of lifestyle modifications may be limited in preventing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> over the long term </plain></SENT>
