<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Insulin suppression of lipolysis is commonly impaired with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and improves with thiazolidinedione treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present studies were designed to assess the effects of thiazolidinedione on NEFA (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30823">oleate</z:chebi>) metabolism that are independent of improved glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We measured plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30823">oleate</z:chebi> concentration and flux ([(3)H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30823">oleate</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> kinetics ([6-(2)H(2)]<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>) and substrate oxidation (indirect calorimetry) before and after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (30 mg/day for approximately 20 weeks) in 20 non-diabetic adults with upper body <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To assess the effects of improved insulin sensitivity per se we performed the same measurements in a matched group of volunteers treated with diet/exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Half of the two groups underwent these measurements during a hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp, and the other half had their measurements taken during a (control) saline infusion before and after the intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both interventions increased insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal and reduced plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30823">oleate</z:chebi> concentrations during the insulin clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After diet/exercise, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30823">oleate</z:chebi> flux decreased (p=0.03) during the insulin clamp and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30823">oleate</z:chebi> clearance remained unchanged (p=0.55), whereas in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> group, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30823">oleate</z:chebi> flux during the clamp was unchanged (p=0.97) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30823">oleate</z:chebi> clearance increased (p=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="30823">Oleate</z:chebi> clearance in the saline control condition was increased in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> group compared with the diet/exercise group (p=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In insulin-resistant, non-diabetic adults, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> increases NEFA clearance during physiological <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020459" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperinsulinaemia</z:e>, whereas improved insulin sensitivity achieved by diet/exercise does not alter NEFA clearance but enhances insulin suppression of NEFA release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This action of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> may contribute to improved <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
