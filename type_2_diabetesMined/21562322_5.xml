<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 1,691 type 2 diabetic subjects with no detectable <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> in two 50° red-free fundus photographs were scheduled for follow-up with photography 3 years later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Age at <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosis was 60 ± 12 years, and known duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 6 ± 6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment consisted of diet only (26%), oral agents (54%), and oral agents and/or insulin (20%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c) was 6.4 ± 1.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 1,322 subjects available for follow-up, 73% were still without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> after 3 years, and 28% had developed mild or moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, but none developed severe nonproliferative or proliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Macular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> requiring laser coagulation occurred in only <z:mp ids='MP_0005163'>one eye</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Three-year <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> screening intervals can be recommended in subjects with mild type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
