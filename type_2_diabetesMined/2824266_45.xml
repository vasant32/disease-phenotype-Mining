<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The kinase activity of the receptor from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three groups of insulin-resistant subjects was 40% less when compared to the activity of lean control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This alteration was present in the absence of changes in the level of the insulin receptor on its insulin binding characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the tyrosine kinase activity of the skeletal muscle insulin receptor is defective in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and that this alteration contributes to the insulin-resistant characteristics of both disorders </plain></SENT>
