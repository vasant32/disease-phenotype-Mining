<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The underlying mechanism is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The foetal insulin hypothesis proposes that a single genetic predisposition to <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta cell dysfunction</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> results in both reduced insulin-dependent foetal growth in utero, hence <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birthweight</z:hpo>, and predisposition to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to test whether, as predicted by the foetal insulin hypothesis, there is an association between measures of paternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and offspring birthweight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The Exeter Family Study of Childhood Health (EFSOCH) is a community-based study within central Exeter (UK), established to test the foetal insulin hypothesis prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Associations were tested between offspring birthweight and paternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, calculated by homeostasis model assessment analysis in 986 families using data relating to singleton, non-diabetic, UK white pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ethics approval was given by the North and East Devon local ethics committee </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Offspring birthweight was not significantly correlated with log paternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (r=0, p=0.91), log <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> concentration (r=-0.02, p=0.47) or log <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> concentration (r=0, p=0.99) when corrected for paternal BMI and common confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multiple linear regression analysis confirmed that paternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> was not an independent predictor of offspring birthweight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Results from a young, adult, non-diabetic population do not support the foetal insulin hypothesis as an explanation for the association of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birthweight</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
