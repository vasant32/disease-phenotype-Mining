<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The gene encoding the voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channel Ca(V)2.3 (CACNA1E), telomeric to a region that has shown suggestive linkage to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (1q21-q25), has been ascribed a role for second-phase insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Based upon the genotyping of 52 haplotype tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> case-control sample (n = 1,467), we selected five SNPs that were nominally associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and genotyped them in the following groups (1) a new case-control sample of 6,570 individuals from Sweden; (2) 2,293 individuals from the Botnia prospective cohort; and (3) 935 individuals with insulin secretion data from an IVGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The rs679931 TT genotype was associated with (1) an increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the Botnia case-control sample [odds ratio (OR) 1.4, 95% CI 1.0-2.0, p = 0.06] and in the replication sample (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.0-1.5, p = 0.01 one-tailed), with a combined OR of 1.3 (95% CI 1.1-1.5, p = 0.004 two-tailed); (2) <z:mp ids='MP_0003059'>reduced insulin secretion</z:mp> [insulinogenic index at 30 min p = 0.02, disposition index (D (I)) p = 0.03] in control participants during an OGTT; (3) reduced second-phase insulin secretion at 30 min (p = 0.04) and 60 min (p = 0.02) during an IVGTT; and (4) reduced D (I) over time in the Botnia prospective cohort (p = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We conclude that genetic variation in the CACNA1E gene contributes to an increased risk of the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by reducing insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
