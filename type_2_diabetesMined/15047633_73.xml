<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Chromosome 20 showed our strongest initial evidence for linkage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It currently has a maximum logarithm of odds (LOD) score of 2.48 at 70 cM in a set of 495 families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we searched for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility variant(s) at 20q13 by genotyping single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in case and control DNA pools </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of 291 SNPs successfully typed in a 7.5-Mb interval, the strongest association confirmed by individual genotyping was with SNP rs2144908, located 1.3 kb downstream of the primary beta-cell promoter P2 of hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 alpha (HNF4A) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This SNP showed association with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> disease status (odds ratio [OR] 1.33, 95% CI 1.06-1.65, P = 0.011) and with several <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most of the evidence for linkage at 20q13 could be attributed to the families carrying the risk allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We subsequently found nine additional associated SNPs spanning a 64-kb region, including the P2 and P1 promoters and exons 1-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results and the independent observation of association of SNPs near the P2 promoter with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a separate study population of Ashkenazi Jewish origin suggests that variant(s) located near or within HNF4A increases susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
