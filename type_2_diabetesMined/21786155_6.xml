<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the possibility that glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent insulinotropic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (GIP) can prevent the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in Apoe (-/-) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Apoe (-/-) mice (17 weeks old) were administered GLP-1(7-36)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29337,32988">amide</z:chebi>, GLP-1(9-36)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29337,32988">amide</z:chebi>, GIP(1-42) or GIP(3-42) for 4 weeks </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Administration of GLP-1(7-36)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29337,32988">amide</z:chebi> or GIP(1-42) significantly suppressed <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> and macrophage infiltration in the aortic wall, compared with vehicle controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These effects were cancelled by co-infusion with specific <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> for GLP-1 and GIP receptors, namely exendin(9-39) or Pro(3)(GIP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The anti-atherosclerotic effects of GLP-1(7-36)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29337,32988">amide</z:chebi> and GIP(1-42) were associated with significant decreases in foam cell formation and downregulation of CD36 and acyl-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="15346">coenzyme A</z:chebi>:cholesterol acyltransferase-1 (ACAT-1) in macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>GLP-1 and GIP receptors were both detected in Apoe (-/-) mouse macrophages </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This effect was wholly abolished in macrophages pretreated with exendin(9-39) or (Pro(3))GIP, or with an adenylate cyclase inhibitor, MDL12,330A, and was mimicked by incubation with an adenylate cyclase activator, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42471">forskolin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The inactive forms, GLP-1(9-36)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29337,32988">amide</z:chebi> and GIP(3-42), had no effects on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and macrophage foam cell formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our study is the first to demonstrate that active forms of GLP-1 and GIP exert anti-atherogenic effects by suppressing macrophage foam cell formation via their own receptors, followed by cAMP activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Molecular mechanisms underlying these effects are associated with the downregulation of CD36 and ACAT-1 by incretins </plain></SENT>
