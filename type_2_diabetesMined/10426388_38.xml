<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although the precise mechanisms contributing to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are unknown, it is believed that defects in downstream components of the insulin signaling pathway may be involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this work, we hypothesize that a serine/threonine kinase, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), may be pertinent in this regard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, we examined GSK-3 activity in two inbred mouse strains known to be susceptible (C57BL/6J) or resistant (A/J) to diet-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Examination of GSK-3 in fat, liver, and muscle tissues of C57BL/6J mice revealed that GSK-3 activity increased twofold in the epididymal fat tissue and remained unchanged in muscle and liver of mice fed a high-fat diet, compared with their low-fat diet-fed counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, GSK-3 activity did not change in the epididymal fat tissue of A/J mice, regardless of the type of diet they were fed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, both basal and diet-induced GSK-3 activity was higher (2.3- and 3.2-fold, respectively) in the adipose tissue of C57BL/6J mice compared with that in A/J mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our studies suggest an unsuspected link between increased GSK-3 activity and development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in fat tissue of C57BL/6J mice, and implicate GSK-3 as a potential factor contributing to susceptibility of C57BL/6J mice to diet-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
