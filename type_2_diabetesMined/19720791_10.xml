<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Low-fat hypocaloric diets reduce <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and prevent type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in those at risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Low-carbohydrate, high-fat diets are advocated as an alternative, but reciprocal increases in dietary fat may have detrimental effects on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and offset the benefits of weight reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We investigated a low-fat (20% fat, 60% carbohydrate) versus a low-carbohydrate (60% fat, 20% carbohydrate) weight reduction diet in 24 overweight/<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects ([mean +/- SD] BMI 33.6 +/- 3.7 kg/m(2), aged 39 +/- 10 years) in an 8-week randomized controlled trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> food was weighed and distributed, and intake was calculated to produce a 500 kcal/day energy deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Insulin action was assessed by the euglycemic clamp and insulin secretion by meal tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Body composition, adipokine levels, and vascular compliance by pulse-wave analysis were also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> occurred in both groups (P &lt; 0.01), with no difference between groups (P = 0.40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Peripheral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake increased, but there was no difference between groups (P = 0.28), and suppression of endogenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production was also similar between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Meal tolerance-related insulin secretion decreased with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> with no difference between groups (P = 0.71) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The change in overall systemic arterial stiffness was, however, significantly different between diets (P = 0.04); this reflected a significant decrease in augmentation index following the low-fat diet, compared with a nonsignificant increase within the low-carbohydrate group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates comparable effects on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> of low-fat and low-carbohydrate diets independent of macronutrient content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The difference in augmentation index may imply a negative effect of low-carbohydrate diets on vascular risk </plain></SENT>
