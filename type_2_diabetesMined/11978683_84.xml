<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) has been proposed as a new treatment modality for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To circumvent the drawback of the short half-life of GLP-1, inhibitors of the GLP-1-degrading enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) have been examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Such inhibitors improve <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance in insulin-resistant rats and mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the 4-week effect of 1-[[[2-[(5-cyanopyridin-2-yl)amino]ethyl]amino]<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>]-2-cyano-(S)-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="33135">pyrrolidine</z:chebi> (NVP DPP728), a selective, orally active inhibitor of DPP IV, in subjects with diet-controlled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a placebo-controlled double-blind multicenter study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 93 patients (61 men and 32 women), aged 64 +/- 9 years (means +/- SD) and with BMI 27.3 +/- 2.7 kg/m(2), entered the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was 8.5 +/- 1.5 mmol/l, and HbA(1c) was 7.4 +/- 0.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Before and after treatment with NVP DPP728 at 100 mg x 3 (n = 31) or 150 mg x 5 (n = 32) or placebo (n = 30), subjects underwent a 24-h study with standardized meals (total 2,000 kcal) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with placebo, NVP DPP728 at 100 mg t.i.d. reduced fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> by 1.0 mmol/l (mean), prandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excursions by 1.2 mmol/l, and mean 24-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels by 1.0 mmol/l (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similar reductions were seen in the 150-mg b.i.d. treatment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean 24-h insulin was reduced by 26 pmol/l in both groups (P = 0.017 and P = 0.023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although not an efficacy parameter foreseen in the study protocol, HbA(1c) was reduced to 6.9 +/- 0.7% in the combined active treatment groups (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Laboratory safety and tolerability was good in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that inhibition of DPP IV is a feasible approach to the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the early stage of the disease </plain></SENT>
