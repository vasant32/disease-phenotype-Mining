<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using information on parity, breastfeeding, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> collected from 52,731 women recruited into a cohort study, we estimated the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> using multivariate logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS A total of 3,160 (6.0%) women were classified as having type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall, nulliparous and parous women had a similar risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among parous women, there was a 14% (95% CI 10-18%, P &lt; 0.001) reduced likelihood of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> per year of breastfeeding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared to nulliparous women, parous women who did not breastfeed had a greater risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (odds ratio 1.48, 95% CI 1.26-1.73, P &lt; 0.001), whereas for women breastfeeding, the risk was not significantly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Compared with nulliparous women, childbearing women who do not breastfeed have about a 50% increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in later life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Breastfeeding substantially reduces this excess risk </plain></SENT>
