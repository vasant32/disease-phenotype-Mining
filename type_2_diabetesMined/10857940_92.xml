<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine prospectively the association between low <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="25" ids="50112">sex hormone</z:chebi>-binding globulin (SHBG) levels and the subsequent development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Analyses were conducted on the cohort of the Massachusetts Male Aging Study, a population-based random sample of men aged 40-70 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the 1,709 men enrolled in 1987-1989 (T1), 1,156 were followed up 7-10 years later (T2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">Testosterone</z:chebi> and SHBG levels at T1 were used to predict new cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> between T1 and T2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After controlling for potential confounders, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at follow-up was predicted jointly and independently by lower baseline levels of free <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> and SHBG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio for future <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 1.58 for a decrease of 1SD in free <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> (4 ng/dl) and 1.89 for a 1SD decrease in SHBG (16 nmol/l), both significant at P &lt; 0.02 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our prospective findings are consistent with previous, mainly cross-sectional reports, suggesting that low levels of <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> and SHBG play some role in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and subsequent type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
