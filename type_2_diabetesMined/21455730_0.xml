<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Genotype data for ADRA2A single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs553668 and rs10885122 were analysed in &gt;17,000 individuals (1,307 type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> cases) with regard to metabolic traits and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two studies (n = 9,437), genotyped using the Human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">Cardiovascular Disease</z:e> BeadChip, provided 12 additional ADRA2A SNPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Rs553668 was associated with per allele effects on fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (0.03 mmol/l, p = 0.016) and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk (OR 1.17, 95% CI 1.04-1.31; p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant association was observed with rs10885122 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 12 SNPs, several showed associations with metabolic traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, after variable selection, rs553668 was associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk (OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.09-1.73; p = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>rs553668 (per allele difference 0.036 mmol/l, 95% CI 0.008-0.065) and rs17186196 (per allele difference 0.066 mmol/l, 95% CI 0.017-0.115) were independently associated with fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and rs17186196 with fasting insulin and HOMA of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (4.3%, 95% CI 0.6-8.1 and 4.9%, 95% CI 1.0-9.0, respectively, per allele) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Per-allele effects of rs491589 on systolic and diastolic blood pressure were 1.19 mmHg (95% CI 0.43-1.95) and 0.61 mmHg (95% CI 0.11-1.10), respectively, and those of rs36022820 on BMI 0.58 kg/m(2) (95% CI 0.15-1.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Multiple ADRA2A SNPs are associated with metabolic traits, blood pressure and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The α-2 adrenergic receptor should be revisited as a therapeutic target for reduction of the adverse consequences of metabolic trait disorders and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
