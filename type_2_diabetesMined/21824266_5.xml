<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A central feature of this pathologic response is insufficient hepatic insulin action, due to a combination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and impaired β-cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, a case can be made that glucagon also plays a role in dysregulated hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011014'>abnormal glucose homeostasis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma glucagon concentrations are inappropriately elevated in diabetic individuals, and α-cell suppression by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> is blunted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Experimental evidence suggests that this contributes to greater rates of hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production in the fasting state and attenuated reduction after meals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recent studies in animal models indicate that reduction of glucagon action can have profound effects to mitigate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> even in the face of severe hypoinsulinaemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While there are no specific treatments for diabetic patients yet available that act specifically on the glucagon signalling pathway, newer agents including glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors reduce plasma glucagon and this is thought to contribute to their action to lower blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The α-cell and glucagon receptor remain tempting targets for novel <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treatments, but it is important to understand the magnitude of benefit new strategies would provide as preclinical models suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> interference with glucagon action could entail adverse effects as well </plain></SENT>
