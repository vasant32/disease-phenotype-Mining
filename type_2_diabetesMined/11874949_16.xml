<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of foot ulceration and lower limb <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath> in type 2 diabetic patients in primary health care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data on type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were collected by the Nijmegen Monitoring Project between 1993 and 1998 as part of a study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients recorded as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206172" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic foot</z:e> problems and those who died, moved to a nursing home, or were under specialist care were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The annual incidence of foot ulceration was defined as the number of type 2 diabetic patients per patient-year who developed a new foot <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Incidence of lower limb <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath> was similarly defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additional information was collected on treatment of foot <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study population of type 2 diabetic patients increased from 511 patient-years in 1993 to 665 in 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The annual incidence of foot ulceration varied between 1.2 and 3.0% (mean 2.1) per year; 25% of the patients had recurrent episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The annual incidence of lower limb <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath> varied between 0.5 and 0.8% (mean 0.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ten of the 15 amputees died, and 12 of 52 (23%) patients with ulceration had a subsequent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath> or a previous history of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 35 of the 73 (48%) episodes of ulceration, only the family physician provided treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with foot problems were older and had more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, and absent peripheral pulses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of foot ulceration and lower limb <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is low; nevertheless, recurrence rates of ulceration and risk of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath> are high, with high mortality </plain></SENT>
