<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was proportion of patients achieving A1C ≤7.0% and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> ≥1.0 kg at end point, analyzed by means of logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Secondary outcomes included measures of glycemic control, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, and safety and tolerability.RESULTSOf 216 patients (intent-to-treat population), 111 received EQW and 105 received detemir </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall, 44.1% (95% CI, 34.7-53.9) of EQW-treated patients compared with 11.4% (6.0-19.1) of detemir-treated patients achieved the primary outcome (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment with EQW resulted in significantly greater reductions than detemir in A1C (least-square mean ± SE, -1.30 ± 0.08% vs. -0.88 ± 0.08%; P &lt; 0.0001) and weight (-2.7 ± 0.3 kg vs. +0.8 ± 0.4 kg; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Gastrointestinal-related and injection site-related adverse events occurred more frequently with EQW than with detemir </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five (6%) patients in the EQW group and six (7%) patients in the detemir group experienced minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>; only one event occurred without concomitant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> (detemir group).CONCLUSIONSTreatment with EQW resulted in a significantly greater proportion of patients achieving target A1C and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> than treatment with detemir, with a low risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that EQW is a viable alternative to insulin detemir treatment in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with inadequate glycemic control using oral antidiabetes drugs </plain></SENT>
