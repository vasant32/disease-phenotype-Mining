<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Although a short course of intensive insulin therapy (IIT) can improve beta-cell function and glycaemic control in most patients with newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2DM), the impact of this intervention in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> of longer duration has not been carefully studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, we sought to evaluate the effect of short-term IIT in patients with established T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-four patients, with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> of mean 5.9 +/- 6.6 years duration, underwent 4-8 weeks of IIT, with 4-h meal test administered at baseline and at 1 day post-IIT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A positive clinical response was defined as fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &lt; 7.0 mmol/l off any <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> therapy at the latter test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A positive response was achieved in 68% (n = 23) of the subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At baseline meal test, the responders had lower <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels than the non-responders from 120 to 240 min (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> timepoints p &lt; or = 0.0008) and higher late incremental area-under-the-C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-curve (AUC(Cpep)), particularly from 60 to 150 min (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Beta-cell function (ratio of AUC(Cpep) to AUC(gluc) divided by HOMA-IR) was similar between the groups at baseline (median 54.1 vs. 51.3, p = 0.62) but after IIT was significantly higher in the responders (109.3 vs. 57.4, p = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At baseline, the strongest predictors of the change in beta-cell function were <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels between 180 and 240 min (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> r = -0.5, p = 0.005) and incremental AUC(Cpep) from 120 to 180 min (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> r &gt; or = 0.66, p &lt; or = 0.0001), both reflecting late-phase insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The clinical response to short-term IIT is variable, consistent with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, preserved late-phase insulin secretion may identify those patients who can benefit from this intervention with improved beta-cell function </plain></SENT>
