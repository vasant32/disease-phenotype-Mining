<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial, 1,124 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> aged between 44 and 85 years participated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The intervention consisted of a multifaceted educational program with an interactive meeting, a leaflet, a Web site, and a consultation with the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care provider </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The program focused on the needs of patients, apparent from a prior focus group and questionnaire study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome measure was an indicator of health-seeking behavior for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">UTIs</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LRTIs</z:e>, defined as the proportion of participants with a positive score on at least seven of nine determinants, six from the Health Belief Model and the additional three domains of knowledge, need for information, and intention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was measured with questionnaires at baseline and after 5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Complete outcome data were available for 468 intervention group patients and 472 control group patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 68% of the intervention group patients attended the meeting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At baseline, 28% of the participants from the intervention group had a positive score on seven of the nine determinants, compared with 27% from the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After the educational program, these percentages were 53 and 32%, respectively (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our educational program positively influenced determinants of health-seeking behavior for common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
