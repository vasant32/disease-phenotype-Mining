<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This randomized, double-blind study characterized the safety and pharmacodynamics of a single dose of PF-04603629 (n = 57; 1-70 mg) or placebo (n = 14) in subjects with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were dose-dependent decreases from baseline in day 6 glucose area under the curve following a mixed meal test (-27 ± 12% with 70 mg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most treatment-related adverse events were gastrointestinal, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002017'>nausea and vomiting</z:hpo> most frequent at 70 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pulse rate (PR) and diastolic blood pressure (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi>) increased dose dependently within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 24 h postdose mean PR increased 23 ± 9 bpm and mean <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> increased 10 ± 5 mmHg with 70 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, PF-04603629 exhibited efficacy and tolerability consistent with its mechanism of action; however, PR and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similar effects have been reported occasionally with other GLP-1 mimetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data underscore the importance of careful assessments of haemodynamic effects in GLP-1 analogues </plain></SENT>
