<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether food insecurity--the inability to reliably afford safe and nutritious food--is associated with poor glycemic control and whether this association is mediated by difficulty following a healthy diet, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-efficacy, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0700361" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">emotional distress</z:e> related to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used multivariable regression models to examine the association between food insecurity and poor glycemic control using a cross-sectional survey and chart review of 711 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in safety net health clinics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We then examined whether difficulty following a diabetic diet, self-efficacy, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0700361" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">emotional distress</z:e> related to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> mediated the relationship between food insecurity and glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The food insecurity prevalence in our sample was 46% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Food-insecure participants were significantly more likely than food-secure participants to have poor glycemic control, as defined by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c) â‰¥8.5% (42 vs. 33%; adjusted odds ratio 1.48 [95% CI 1.07-2.04]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Food-insecure participants were more likely to report difficulty affording a diabetic diet (64 vs. 49%, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They also reported lower <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-specific self-efficacy (P &lt; 0.001) and higher <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0700361" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">emotional distress</z:e> related to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Difficulty following a healthy diet and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0700361" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">emotional distress</z:e> partially mediated the association between food insecurity and glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Food insecurity is an independent risk factor for poor glycemic control in the safety net setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This risk may be partially attributable to increased difficulty following a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-appropriate diet and increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0700361" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">emotional distress</z:e> regarding capacity for successful <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Screening patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for food insecurity may be appropriate, particularly in the safety net setting </plain></SENT>
