<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study population included patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> attending an annual review in New Zealand primary care during 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Primary care data were linked to hospital admission data to identify previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For those without previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>, 5-year cardiovascular risk was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Proportions on, and predictors of appropriate treatment according to guidelines were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Data were available on 29,179 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Maori and Pacific participants had high rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, poor glycaemic control and <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two thirds of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants with previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> (68% of Maori and 70% of Pacific) and 44% with high <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk received appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> treatment; 73% of Maori, 62% of Pacific and 65% of European patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> received <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE-inhibitors</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Those with high <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk were more likely, and those that were young were less likely, to receive anti-hypertensive and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering treatment after controlling for other factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Maori and Pacific people were receiving similar high rates of appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> and renal preventive drug therapy to Europeans, but their prevalence of smoking, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, raised HbA1c and <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> were substantially higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Non-drug components of preventive care also need to be addressed to reduce major ethnic disparities in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related morbidity and mortality in New Zealand </plain></SENT>
