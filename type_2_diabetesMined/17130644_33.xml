<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a fuel-sensing enzyme that among its other actions responds to decreases in cellular energy state by enhancing processes that generate ATP and inhibiting others that consume ATP but are not acutely necessary for survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IL-6 is synthesized and released from skeletal muscle in large amounts during exercise, and in rodents, the resultant increase in its concentration correlates temporally with increases in AMPK activity in multiple tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>That IL-6 may be responsible in great measure for these increases in AMPK is suggested by the fact it increases AMPK activity both in muscle and adipose tissue in vivo and in incubated muscles and cultured adipocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, we have found that AMPK activity is diminished in muscle and adipose tissue of 3-month-old IL-6 knockout (KO) mice at rest and that the absolute increases in AMPK activity in these tissues caused by exercise is diminished compared with control mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Except for an impaired ability to exercise and to oxidize fatty acids, the IL-6 KO mouse appears <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> at 3 months of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, by age 9 months, it manifests many of the abnormalities of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This, plus the association of decreased AMPK activity with similar abnormalities in a number of other rodents, suggests that a decrease in AMPK activity may be a causal factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Whether increases in IL-6, by virtue of their effects on AMPK, contribute to the reported ability of exercise to diminish the prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e>, and other disorders associated with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
