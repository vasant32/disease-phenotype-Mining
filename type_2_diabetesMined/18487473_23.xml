<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, the putative <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28757">fructose</z:chebi> transporter SLC2A9 was reported to influence <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to examine the association of four single nucleotide polymorphisms within this gene with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> levels and to determine whether this association is modified by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Four single nucleotide polymorphisms within SLC2A9 (rs6855911, rs7442295, rs6449213, and rs12510549) were genotyped in the population-based prospective Bruneck Study (n = 800) and in a case-control study from Utah including 1,038 subjects recruited for severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and 831 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We observed highly significant associations between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four polymorphisms and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> levels in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> study groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each copy of the minor allele decreased age- and sex-adjusted <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> levels by 0.30-0.35 mg/dl on average, which translates to a relative decrease of 5-6% with P values ranging from 10(-9) to 10(-11) in the combined analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An extended adjustment for BMI, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001997'>gout</z:hpo> medication, and alcohol intake improved P values to a range of 10(-14) to 10(-20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The association was more pronounced in women and the population-based Bruneck Study and was significantly modified by BMI, with stronger effect sizes in individuals with high BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Genetic variants within SLC2A9 have significant effects on <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> levels and are modified by sex and BMI </plain></SENT>
