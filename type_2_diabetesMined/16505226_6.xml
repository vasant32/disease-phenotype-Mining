<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To identify novel pathways mediating molecular mechanisms of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> (TZDs) in humans, we assessed gene expression in adipose and muscle tissue from six subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> before and after 8 weeks of treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was analyzed using Total Gene Expression Analysis (TOGA), an automated restriction-based cDNA display method with quantitative analysis of PCR products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The expression of cell cycle regulatory transcription factors E2F4 and the MAGE protein necdin were similarly altered in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>E2F4 expression was decreased by 10-fold in muscle and 2.5-fold in adipose tissue; necdin was identified in adipose tissue only and increased 1.8-fold after TZD treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To determine whether changes were related to an effect of the drug or adipogenesis, we evaluated the impact of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> and differentiation independently in 3T3-L1 adipocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While treatment of differentiated adipocytes with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> did not alter E2F4 or necdin, expression of both genes was significantly altered during differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Differentiation was associated with increased cytosolic localization of E2F4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, necdin overexpression potently inhibited adipocyte differentiation and cell cycle progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that changes in necdin and E2F4 expression after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> exposure in humans are associated with altered adipocyte differentiation and may contribute to improved insulin sensitivity in humans treated with TZDs </plain></SENT>
