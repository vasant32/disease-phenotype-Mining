<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, we found that the transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-4alpha binds to PED promoter and represses its transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the molecular details responsible for regulation of PED gene remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Here we used gain and loss of function approaches to investigate the hypothesis that HNF-4alpha controls chromatin remodelling at the PED promoter in human cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HNF-4alpha production and binding induce chromatin remodelling at the -250 to 50 region of PED, indicating that remodelling is limited to two nucleosomes located at the proximal promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays also revealed concomitant HNF-4alpha-induced deacetylation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H3 at Lys9 and Lys14, and increased dimethylation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H3 at Lys9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The latter was followed by reduction of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H3 Lys4 dimethylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HNF-4alpha was also shown to target the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylase complex associated with silencing mediator of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> and thyroid hormone receptor, both at the PED promoter, and at GRB14 and USP21 regulatory regions, leading to a reduction of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, HNF-4alpha silencing and PED overexpression were accompanied by a significant reduction of hepatic <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These results show that HNF-4alpha serves as a scaffold protein for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylase activities, thereby inhibiting liver expression of genes including PED </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Dysregulation of these mechanisms may lead to upregulation of the PED gene in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
