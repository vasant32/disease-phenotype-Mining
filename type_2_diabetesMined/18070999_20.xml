<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: An observational cohort of 6,249 women aged 20-79 years was free of baseline <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CRF was measured using a maximal treadmill exercise test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BMI was computed from measured height and weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was identified primarily by 1997 American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During a 17-year follow-up, 143 cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with the least fit third, the multivariate (including BMI)-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) (95% CI) was 0.86 (0.59-1.25) for the middle third and 0.61 (0.38-0.96) for the upper third of CRF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For BMI, the multivariate (including CRF)-adjusted HR (95% CI) was 2.34 (1.55-3.54) for overweight individuals and 3.70 (2.12-6.44) for <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals, compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-weight patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the combined analyses, overweight/<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> unfit (the lowest one-third of CRF) women had significantly higher risks compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-weight fit (the upper two-thirds of CRF) women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Low CRF and higher BMI were independently associated with incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The protective effect of CRF was observed in individuals who were overweight or <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, but CRF did not eliminate the increased risk in these groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings underscore the critical importance of promoting regular physical activity and maintaining <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> weight for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention </plain></SENT>
