<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>beta-Cell deficiency for the ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), which mediates the efflux of cellular cholesterol, leads to altered intracellular cholesterol homeostasis and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948379" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">impaired insulin secretion</z:e> in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to assess the impact of ABCA1 dysfunction on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In heterozygous carriers of disruptive mutations in ABCA1 and family-based noncarriers of similar age, sex, and BMI, we performed oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests (OGTTs) (n = 15 vs. 14) and hyperglycemic clamps (n = 8 vs. 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> levels in carriers were less than half those in noncarriers, but <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> levels did not differ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was similar between groups, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> curves after an OGTT were mildly higher in carriers than in noncarriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During hyperglycemic clamps, carriers demonstrated lower first-phase insulin secretion than noncarriers but no difference in insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The disposition index (a measure of beta-cell function adjusted for insulin sensitivity) of the carriers was significantly reduced in ABCA1 heterozygotes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Carriers of loss-of-function mutations in ABCA1 show <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948379" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">impaired insulin secretion</z:e> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data provide evidence that ABCA1 is important for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> beta-cell function in humans </plain></SENT>
