<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Circulating levels of bradykinin and kallidin <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi>, and high and low molecular weight kininogens, as well as plasma and tissue kallikrein, and kallistatin were measured in non-diabetic and diabetic patients before coronary artery bypass graft surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Tissue kallikrein levels in atrial tissue were examined by immunohistochemistry and atrial tissue kallikrein <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> quantified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Plasma levels of tissue kallikrein were approximately 62% higher in diabetic than in non-diabetic patients (p=0.001), whereas no differences were seen in circulating levels of bradykinin and kallidin <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi>, and high and low molecular weight kininogens, or in plasma kallikrein or kallistatin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry revealed a twofold increase in tissue kallikrein levels in atrial myocytes (p= 0.015), while tissue kallikrein <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were increased eightfold in atrial tissue of diabetic patients (p=0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">Statin</z:chebi> therapy did not change any variables of the circulating kallikrein-kinin system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neither aspirin, calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi>, beta blockers or long-acting nitrate therapies influenced any kallikrein-kinin system variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Tissue kallikrein levels are increased in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, whereas <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> therapy does not modify the circulating kallikrein-kinin system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cardiac tissue kallikrein may play a greater cardioprotective role in type 2 diabetic than in non-diabetic patients and contribute to the benefits of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitor</z:chebi> therapy in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, our findings do not support a role for the kallikrein-kinin system in mediating the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> therapy on endothelial function </plain></SENT>
