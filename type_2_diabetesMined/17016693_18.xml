<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied a birth cohort of 5,793 individuals who were born between 1950 and 1956 in Aberdeen, Scotland, and who responded to a questionnaire administered in 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Birthweight and gestational age were inversely associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These associations remained with additional adjustment for indicators of childhood and adult socioeconomic position, maternal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032962" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">complications of pregnancy</z:e>, adult smoking, adult BMI and simultaneous adjustment for each other: the adjusted odds ratio per unit increase in birthweight z score was 0.73 (95% CI 0.60-0.88), the odds ratio per week increase in gestational age was 0.91 (95% CI 0.82-1.00) and odds ratio for preterm birth was 2.04 (94% CI 1.18-3.53) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The positive association of childhood BMI with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was attenuated on adjustment for adult BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In this population, who were born in the 1950s, poor intrauterine growth and preterm birth are associated with an increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
