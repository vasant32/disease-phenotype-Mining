<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To evaluate the effects of intensive insulin therapy alone and with added <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> on body weight, fat distribution, lean body mass (LBM) and liver fat in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-five insulin-treated, <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were randomized to addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> 45 mg (n = 12) or placebo (n = 13) and treated intensively for 12-16 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry/abdominal computed tomography scans were performed before/after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>LBM, visceral/subcutaneous adipose tissue (VAT/SAT) and liver/spleen (L/S) attenuation ratios were measured pre-/posttreatment (a ratio &lt;1 represents <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>fatty liver</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Intensive insulin alone and insulin + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> significantly improved glycaemic control (7.8 ± 0.3 to 7.2 ± 0.3% and 7.6 ± 0.3 to 7.1 ± 0.4%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Body <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> was greater with insulin + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (4.9 ± 4.5 kg) versus insulin therapy alone (1.7 ± 0.7 kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SAT increased significantly with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> + insulin therapy (393.9 ± 48.5 to 443.2 ± 56.7 cm(2) , p &lt; 0.01) compared to a non-significant increase with insulin therapy alone (412.9 ± 42.5 to 420.8 ± 43.8 cm(2) ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>VAT decreased non-significantly in both groups (240.3 ± 41.7 to 223.8 ± 38.1 cm(2) with insulin + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> and 266.6 ± 27.4 to 250.5 ± 22.2 cm(2) with insulin therapy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>LBM increased significantly by 1.92 ± 0.74 kg with insulin + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The L/S attenuation ratio in the placebo + insulin group decreased from 1.08 ± 0.1 to 1.04 ± 0.1 (p = ns) and increased from 1.00 ± 0.1 to 1.08 ± 0.05 (p = 0.06) in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> + insulin group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intensification of insulin therapy in type 2 diabetic patients causes modest <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> and no change in body fat distribution, LBM or liver fat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>, at equivalent glycaemia, increases <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>, fat mass and SAT; increases LBM and tends to decrease liver fat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These changes in fat distribution may contribute to the beneficial effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>, despite greater <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
