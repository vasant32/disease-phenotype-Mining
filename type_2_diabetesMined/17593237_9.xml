<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This 26-week, multi-centre, open-labelled, randomized, two-arm parallel trial consisted of a 2-week screening period, followed by 24 weeks of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects randomized to BIAsp30 treatment (n = 129) received BIAsp30 once daily (o.d.) at dinnertime between Week 2 and Week 14, and those not reaching treatment targets were switched to twice daily (b.i.d.) BIAsp30 at Week 14 (n = 50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects randomized to the OAD-only arm (n = 63) continued with their previous OAD treatment and, in an attempt to reach treatment goals, the dose was optimized (but OAD unchanged) in accordance to local treatment practice and labelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significantly greater reductions in HbA(1c) over Weeks 0-13 with BIAsp30 (o.d.) vs. OAD-only treatment (1.16 vs. 0.58%; p &lt; 0.001), and over Weeks 0-26, with BIAsp30 (o.d.) and BIAsp30 (b.i.d.) treatments vs. OAD-only treatment (1.24 vs. 1.34 vs. 0.67%; p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0745153" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hypoglycaemic episodes</z:e> were reported in 54% of the patients in BIAsp30 (o.d. and b.i.d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>pooled) and 30% of the patients in OAD-only group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> episodes were minor or symptomatic, except for one in each treatment group, which was major </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Initiating BIAsp30 treatment is a safe and more effective way to improve glycaemic control in Western Pacific patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> inadequately controlled with oral monotherapy or oral combination therapy compared with optimizing oral combination therapy alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients not reaching treatment target on BIAsp30 (o.d.), treatment with BIAsp30 (b.i.d.) should be considered </plain></SENT>
