<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Sixty-two men and women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were randomized to 12 weeks of structured exercise training with or without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> treatment or to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Glycemic control was determined by HbA(1c) (A1C), insulin sensitivity (M value) by euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp, and regional fat distribution by computerized tomography and dual X-ray absorptiometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Physical fitness was determined as maximal oxygen uptake (Vo(2max)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> investigations were performed before and after the intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-eight subjects completed the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Exercise improved M value by 92% (P = 0.017) and decreased total and truncal fat (P = 0.002, 0.001) and systolic blood pressure (P = 0.01) but had no significant effect on Vo(2max) or A1C level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The combination of exercise and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> significantly decreased fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, A1C, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, and diastolic blood pressure and increased Vo(2max), whereas effects on M value and body composition were comparable with that of exercise alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">Acarbose</z:chebi> alone had no significant effect on either M value or A1C but decreased systolic (P = 0.001) and diastolic blood pressure (P = 0.001) and fasting proinsulin level (P = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multiple regression analysis showed that addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> to exercise improved glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In subjects with mild type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, exercise training improved insulin sensitivity but had no effect on glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> to exercise, however, was associated with significant improvement of glycemic control and possibly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
