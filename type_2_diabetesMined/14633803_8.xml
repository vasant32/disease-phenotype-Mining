<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We randomly assigned 173 high-risk men (mean age, 55 years) to either the NDE or the control (conventional dietary education) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each subject in the NDE group received two individualized interventions especially aimed at reducing total energy intake at dinner by modifying dietary intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The control group received conventional group counseling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An "overintake/underintake fraction" for total energy intake was used to measure the status of dietary intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our hypothesis was that the NDE group would have a 10% decrease in 2-h PG 1 year after the start of the education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Outcome measures were compared with ANCOVA by adjusting for baseline values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The NDE group had a significantly lower total energy intake at dinner and daily than the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The adjusted differences in changes from baseline in the absolute value of the 'overintake/underintake fraction' were -15.3% (95% CI -24.6 to -6.0%, P = 0.002) for dinner and -6.0% (-9.8 to -2.2%, P = 0.002) for daily [corrected] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The NDE group had a decreased 2-h PG after 1 year, whereas that value was increased in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The adjusted difference in the percent change of 2-h PG was significant (-15.2%, -22.0 to -8.4%, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The NDE was shown to reduce <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels in high-risk subjects for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
