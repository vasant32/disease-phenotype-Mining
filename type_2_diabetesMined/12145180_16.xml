<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effects of circulating IGFs on the vasculature are largely modulated by IGFBPs, which control their access to cell-surface IGF receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IGFBP-1 has been proposed as the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> regulator of IGF bioavailability because of its metabolic regulation by glucoregulatory hormones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Posttranslational phosphorylation of IGFBP-1 significantly increases its affinity for IGF-I and therefore represents a further mechanism for controlling IGF bioavailability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have therefore examined the IGF system and IGFBP-1 phosphorylation status, using specifically developed immunoassays, in a cohort of 160 extensively characterized type 2 diabetic subjects on two occasions 12 months apart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Total IGFBP-1 (tIGFBP-1), which is predominantly highly phosphorylated, was significantly lower in subjects with known macrovascular disease (geometric mean [95% CI], 48.7 microg/l [33.7-63.6]) than in patients with no vascular pathology (80.0 microg/l [52.2-107]; F = 5.4, P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A similar relationship was found for highly phosphorylated IGFBP-1 (hpIGFBP-1) concentration (known macrovascular disease, 45.1 microg/l [35.1-55.2]; no macrovascular disease, 75.8 microg/l [56.2-95.3]; F = 4.8, P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression showed that for every decrease of 2.73 microg/l in IGFBP-1 concentration, there was a 43% increase in the odds of a subject having macrovascular disease (odds ratio 0.57 [95% CI 0.40-0.83]; P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>hpIGFBP-1 correlated negatively with systolic blood pressure (rho = -0.30, P &lt; 0.01), diastolic blood pressure (rho = -0.45, P &lt; 0.001), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) (rho = -0.41, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Linear regression modeling showed that 40% of the variance in tIGFBP-1 was accounted for by MAP, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, and nonesterified fatty acids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, levels of nonphosphorylated and lesser-phosphorylated IGFBP-1 (lpIGFBP-1) were unrelated to macrovascular disease or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> but did correlate positively with fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration (rho = 0.350, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>tIGFBP-1 concentrations were higher in subjects treated with insulin alone (n = 29) than for any other group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This effect persisted after adjustment of tIGFBP-1 levels for BMI, C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, age, and sex (F = 6.5, P &lt; 0.001, rho = - 0.46) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Such an effect was not apparent for lpIGFBP-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We conclude that low circulating levels of hpIGFBP-1 are closely correlated with macrovascular disease and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, whereas lpIGFBP-1 isoforms are associated with glycemic control, suggesting a dual role for IGFBP-1 in the regulation of IGF actions in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that high circulating concentrations of highly phosphorylated IGFBP-1 may protect against the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> by reducing the mitogenic potential of IGFs on the vasculature </plain></SENT>
