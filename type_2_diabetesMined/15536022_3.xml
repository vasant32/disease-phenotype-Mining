<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine the clinical characteristics in adolescent type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (young <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, YDM) in Taiwan, we enrolled 11 males who were diagnosed with YDM before 19 years of age into our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Another 11 patients with adult type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (mature age <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, MADM) who were diagnosed after the age of 40 were enrolled as compare group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects from both groups were being treated with oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi> only at the time of enrollment, and none of the subjects had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001953'>diabetic ketoacidosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels were measured from the fasting plasma sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A homeostasis model assessment was used to estimate insulin sensitivity (HOMA-S) and beta-cell function (HOMA-B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Frequent-sampled intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test was also performed to measure the insulin sensitivity (S(I)), <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> effectiveness (E(G)), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin response after <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> load (AIR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for age and BMI, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, and HOMA-B levels were similar between two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The fasting plasma insulin and HOMA-S were significantly higher in YDM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the S(I), E(G) and AIR in both groups were also not significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in YDM may be due to the early deterioration of the S(I), E(G) and AIR with similar severity compared with MADM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The role of E(G) might be more important than previously thought in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Finally, the YDM might be a subtype of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
