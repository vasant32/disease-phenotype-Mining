<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> only (n = 695), type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> only (n = 181) or both (n = 240), who consecutively attended an annual control in primary care in Skara, Sweden during 1992-1993, were evaluated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> risk factors and enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects with neither <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> nor type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 824) who participated in a population survey in the same community served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Possible events of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> through 2002 were validated using hospital records and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> certificates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During a mean follow-up time of 8.4 years, 190 first events of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, fatal or non-fatal, were ascertained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Risk factor levels were generally higher in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patient categories than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> risk was significantly increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> male patients: hazard ratio 4.2 (95% CI 2.1-8.4) in patients with both conditions, 3.3 (1.5-7.0) in those with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> alone and 2.8 (1.5-5.3) in those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> alone (adjusted for age, total cholesterol, current smoking, BMI and physical activity) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Corresponding findings in women were 2.9 (1.5-5.8) in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> only and 2.4 (1.2-4.7) in those with both conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, in women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> only, a significant risk was seen first when subjects were truncated at 85 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were too few fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> events for conclusive results on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A considerable risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> remains in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Strategies for stricter multiple risk factor interventions should be implemented in primary care </plain></SENT>
