<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the impact of bed-time insulin versus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> treatment on these parameters in type 2 diabetic (T2D) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-eight T2D patients poorly controlled with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> were randomized to receive add-on therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> or bed-time <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IAF and subcutaneous fat (SCF) content, systemic low-grade <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> level and expression of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> related genes in SCF, were measured before and after 24 weeks of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Insulin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> resulted in a significant decrease in HbA1c (-1.6% and -1.2%, respectively) and a significant increase in total body fat mass (1+/-2.3 and 3.3+/-2.7 kg, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no change in IAF content after both treatments whereas significant increase in SCF content was only seen after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> treatment (p&lt;0.05 versus insulin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>hsCRP level decreased after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> and ferritin level decreased after insulin treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No change in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> related genes was found after either treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: This suggests that a 24-week treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> or bed-time insulin has a similar impact on intra-abdominal fat mass and systemic low-grade <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
