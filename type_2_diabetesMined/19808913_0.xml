<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study compared the effect of VIAject with human regular insulin and insulin lispro on postprandial <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and endothelial function in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Fourteen patients (seven men; aged 61.5 +/- 1.8 years; duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> 6.6 +/- 4.6 years; A1C 7.2 +/- 0.5% [mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>]) received a prandial injection of VIAject, human regular insulin, and insulin lispro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At baseline and after a standardized liquid meal test (Ensure Plus), the postprandial increases in asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and nitrotyrosine levels were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, the postprandial effects on microvascular blood flow, skin oxygenation, and vascular elasticity were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treatment with VIAject resulted in a significant reduction in the peak postprandial generation of ADMA compared with human insulin and insulin lispro (VIAject -27.3 +/- 22.6, human insulin 97.7 +/- 24.4, and insulin lispro 66.9 +/- 33.9 nmol/l; P &lt; 0.05, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The postprandial increases in nitrotyrosine levels were significantly less after VIAject than after human regular insulin (VIAject -0.22 +/- 0.17 vs. human insulin 0.25 +/- 0.15 microg/ml; P &lt; 0.05), whereas nitrotyrosine after insulin lispro was in between (insulin lispro 0.09 +/- 0.07 microg/ml; NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In parallel, earlier and more pronounced increases in microvascular blood flow and skin oxygenation were obtained after VIAject compared with those after human insulin or insulin lispro (P &lt; 0.05, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> insulin formulations resulted in comparable improvements in central arterial elasticity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS; Treatment with VIAject reduced postprandial <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and improved endothelial function compared with human regular insulin or insulin lispro </plain></SENT>
