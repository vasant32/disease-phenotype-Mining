<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of nitrendipine in comparison with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3380">captopril</z:chebi> in hypertensive diabetic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> (LVH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 75 patients enrolled in this study presented stable type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (not treated with insulin) and mild-to-moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> with a left ventricular mass &gt; or = 75 g/m2 by two-dimensional echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After a 4-week washout period, 38 patients were assigned to treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3380">captopril</z:chebi>, and 37 patients to nitrendipine (random allocation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The duration of follow-up was 36 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients of both groups were similar with regard to the duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, systolic and diastolic blood pressure at rest, degree of LVH, metabolic control, and albumin excretion rate (AER) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both drugs were equally effective in reducing systolic and diastolic blood pressure (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="3380">captopril</z:chebi>: from 165 +/- 13/100 +/- 4 to 147 +/- 11/87 +/- 4 mmHg; nitrendipine: from 167 +/- 17/100 +/- 5 to 143 +/- 9/86 +/- 4 mmHg; P &lt; 0.05) and in reversing LVH (nitrendipine: from 87 +/- 2 to 81 +/- 1 g/m2; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3380">captopril</z:chebi>: from 89 +/- 2 to 85 +/- 2 g/m2; P = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neither the left ventricular end-diastolic volume index nor the left ventricular ejection fraction changed significantly during the treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Nitrendipine is as effective as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3380">captopril</z:chebi> in reducing both systolic and diastolic blood pressure and in reversing LVH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neither drug showed any negative side effects on fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA1c) levels, and both maintain constant AERs </plain></SENT>
