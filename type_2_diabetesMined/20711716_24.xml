<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Yet whether this risk is different for studies using questionnaires than for those relying on diagnostic criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> has not been examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examined the association of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> by reviewing the literature and conducting a meta-analysis of longitudinal studies on this topic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycInfo were searched for articles published up to September 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> studies that examined the relationship between type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pooled relative risks were calculated using fixed and random effects models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eleven studies met our inclusion criteria for this meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on the pooled data, including 48,808 cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> at baseline, the pooled relative risk was 1.24 (95% CI 1.09-1.40) for the random effects model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This risk was significantly higher for studies relying on diagnostic criteria of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> than for studies using questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, this difference was no longer significant when controlled for year of publication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Compared with non-diabetic controls, people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have a 24% increased risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms underlying this relationship are still unclear and warrant further research </plain></SENT>
