<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) alpha/gamma dual <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> have the potential to be used as therapeutic agents for the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated the function of macelignan, a natural compound isolated from Myristica fragrans, as a dual <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> for PPARalpha/gamma and investigated its antidiabetes effects in animal models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: GAL4/PPAR chimera transactivation was performed and the expression of PPARalpha/gamma target genes was monitored to examine the ability of macelignan to activate PPARalpha/gamma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, macelignan was administrated to <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> diabetic (db/db) mice to investigate antidiabetes effects and elucidate its molecular mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Macelignan reduced serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, free fatty acid levels, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> levels in the skeletal muscle and liver of db/db mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, macelignan significantly improved <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin tolerance in these mice, and without altering food intake, their body weights were slightly reduced while weights of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi>-treated mice increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Macelignan increased adiponectin expression in adipose tissue and serum, whereas the expression and serum levels of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha and interleukin-6 decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Macelignan downregulated inflammatory gene expression in the liver and increased <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase activation in the skeletal muscle of db/db mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Strikingly, macelignan reduced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase activation in the liver and adipose tissue of db/db mice and subsequently increased insulin signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Macelignan enhanced insulin sensitivity and improved <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disorders</z:e> by activating PPARalpha/gamma and attenuating ER stress, suggesting that it has potential as an antidiabetes agent for the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
