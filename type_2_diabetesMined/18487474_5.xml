<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether increased daily physical activity improves <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> function and/or <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> oxidation in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Volunteers with (n = 10) and without (n = 10) type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were matched for habitual physical activity, age, sex, and weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Basal and maximal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> activity, physical activity, and resting substrate oxidation were measured at baseline and after 2 and 8 weeks of increased physical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Baseline physical activity (6,450 +/- 851 vs. 7,638 +/- 741 steps/day), basal ATP use (12 +/- 1 vs. 12 +/- 1 micromol x ml(-1) x min(-1)), phosphocreatine recovery from exercise (31 +/- 5 vs. 29 +/- 3 s), and basal <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> oxidation (0.57 +/- 0.07 vs. 0.65 +/- 0.06 mg x kg body wt(-1) x min(-1)) were similar in people with and without type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a significant increase in physical activity after 8 weeks (12,322 +/- 1,979 vs. 9,187 +/- 1,159 steps/day, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Following increased physical activity, there were no changes in basal ATP use or phosphocreatine recovery after exercise in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Basal <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> oxidation increased after 8 weeks of increased physical activity in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (0.79 +/- 0.08 mg x kg(-1) x min(-1)) but not people without (0.68 +/- 0.13 mg x kg body wt(-1) x min(-1)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Resting and maximal ATP turnover are not impaired in people with well-controlled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with control subjects matched for physical activity as well as age and weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increased unsupervised daily physical activity is sustainable and improves <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> oxidation independent of change in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> activity in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
