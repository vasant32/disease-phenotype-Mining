<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Although studies have indicated that increased dairy intake may reduce risk of overweight and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> syndrome, data directly relating dairy intake to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> remain sparse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We prospectively examined the associations between intake of dairy foods and calcium and incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in 37,183 women without a history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During an average of 10 years of follow-up, we documented 1,603 incident cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for potential confounders including BMI, smoking status, physical activity, family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, alcohol consumption, history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, use of hormones, and high cholesterol, the relative risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among women in the highest quintile of dairy intake was 0.79 (95% CI 0.67-0.94; P for trend = 0.007) compared with those in the lowest quintile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each serving-per-day increase in dairy intake was associated with a 4% lower risk (0.96 [0.93-1.01]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The inverse association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> appeared to be mainly attributed to low-fat dairy intake; the multivariate relative risks comparing the highest to the lowest quintiles was 0.79 (0.67-0.93; P for trend = 0.002) for low-fat dairy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The inverse relation between dairy intake and incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> remained unchanged after further adjustment for dietary calcium, <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi>, glycemic load, fat, fiber, and <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These associations also did not vary significantly according to BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A dietary pattern that incorporates higher low-fat dairy products may lower the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in middle-aged or older women </plain></SENT>
