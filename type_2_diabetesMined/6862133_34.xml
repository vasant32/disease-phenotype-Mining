<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> and Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> are common in the Mexican American population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is not clear whether this is merely a specific instance of the more general phenomenon of excess Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> among poor people, or whether Mexican Americans have a discrete genetic susceptibility to Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The latter consideration arises because Mexican Americans are of mixed native American and European ancestry and native Americans may have a genetic predisposition to Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> which Mexican Americans could share </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied 936 Mexican Americans and 398 Anglo-Americans randomly selected from three socially and culturally distinct neighborhoods in San Antonio, Texas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three categories of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>--lean, average, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>--were defined using the Anglo-American distribution of the sum of the triceps and subscapular skinfold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mexican Americans were two to four times as likely to fall into the <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> category as Anglo-Americans, but within categories, the two ethnic groups were closely matched in terms of sum of skinfolds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, however, was significantly greater in Mexican Americans than in Anglo-Americans even when the comparisons were made within the three <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The summary prevalence ratio, controlling for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, was 2.54 for men (p = 0.004) and 1.70 for women (p = 0.036) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, lean Mexican Americans are still at greater risk of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than equally lean Anglo-Americans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conversely, although Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevalence increases as expected with increasing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in both ethnic groups, <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> Anglo-Americans are still relatively protected compared with equally <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> Mexican Americans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was significantly higher in Mexican Americans than in Anglo-Americans even after controlling for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that, although <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> contributes to Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Mexican Americans, it does not by itself explain the entire excess prevalence rate </plain></SENT>
