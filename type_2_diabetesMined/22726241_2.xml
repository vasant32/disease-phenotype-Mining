<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This double-blind, two-period, incomplete block cross-over trial investigated the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of IDeg at steady state (SS) in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-nine subjects treated with insulin without concomitant oral anti-diabetic drugs were given IDeg (0.4, 0.6 and/or 0.8 U/kg) once daily for two 6-day periods, separated by an interval of 13-21 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following dosing on Day 6, subjects underwent a 26-h euglycaemic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> clamp (Biostator®; clamp blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level: 90 mg/dl; 5.0 mmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pharmacokinetic samples were taken until 120 h after last dosing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> dose levels, the mean <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion rate (GIR) profiles were flat and stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering effect of IDeg was evenly distributed over the dosing interval τ, with area under the curve (AUC) for each of the four 6-h intervals being approximately 25% of the total AUC (AUC(GIR) (,τ,) (SS) ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Total <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering effect increased linearly with increasing dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects stayed very close to the clamp target until end of clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The terminal half-life of IDeg was approximately 25 h at steady state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>IDeg was well tolerated and no safety concerns were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No injection site reactions were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: IDeg has a flat and consistent <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering effect in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
