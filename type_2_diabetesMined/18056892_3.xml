<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Anthropometric measurements and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> status were assessed by standard procedures among Aborigines (n = 1,456) and Australians aged &gt;or=25 years (n = 11,247) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Age-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among Aborigines relative to AusDiab participants were calculated by commonly used categories of body size measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The OR (95% CI) values for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, overweight, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (by waist) Aboriginal women relative to AusDiab women were 2.6 (0.6-11.5), 13.1 (6.7-25.7), and 6.1 (4.6-8.0), respectively, and for Aboriginal men relative to AusDiab men, they were 7.6 (4.6-12.5), 7.6 (4.3-13.4), and 5.2 (3.4-8.0), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rates of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were also excessive in Aborigines for each standard category of BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Higher rates of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, even at <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and lower body habitus measurements, among Aborigines suggest that strategies for prevention should expand beyond exclusive focus on diet and weight management </plain></SENT>
