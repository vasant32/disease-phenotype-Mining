<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hepatic glucokinase (GK) is an important regulator of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> storage and disposal in the liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>GK levels are lowered in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004904'>maturity-onset diabetes of the young</z:hpo> and in some diabetic animal models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we explored the adenoviral vector-mediated overexpression of GK in a diet-induced murine model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> as a treatment for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diabetic mice were treated by intravenous administration with an E1/E2a/E3-deleted adenoviral vector encoding human hepatic GK (Av3hGK) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two weeks posttreatment, the Av3hGK-treated diabetic mice displayed normalized fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels (95 +/- 4.8 mg/dl; P &lt; 0.001) when compared with Av3Null (135 +/- 5.9 mg/dl), an analogous vector lacking a transgene, and vehicle-treated diabetic mice (134 +/- 8 mg/dl) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>GK treatment also resulted in lowered insulin levels (632 +/- 399 pg/ml; P &lt; 0.01) compared with the control groups (Av3Null, 1,803 +/- 291 pg/ml; vehicle, 1,861 +/- 392 pg/ml), and the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance of the Av3hGK-treated diabetic mice was normalized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant increase in plasma or hepatic <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, or plasma free fatty acids was observed in the Av3hGK-treated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that overexpression of GK may have a therapeutic potential for the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
