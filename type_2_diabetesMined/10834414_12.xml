<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a population-based study, we compared the phenotype in 3 groups of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first group had no family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (FH-, n = 148); the second group had a family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> only (FH+(TYPE2), n = 1,211); and the third group had a family history of both type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (FH+(MIXED), n = 240) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we studied the frequency of GAD antibodies (GADabs), HLA-DQB1 risk genotypes, and the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> (CHD) according to family history in unrelated patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from 787 families (148 FH-, 546 FH+(TYPE2) and 93 FH+(MIXED)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with no family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were older at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the disease, had a better beta-cell function (P = 0.004), and had higher <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> concentrations (P = 0.006) than patients with a family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with a family history of only type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had higher BMI and fasting C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> concentrations (P = 0.031) but lower frequency of GADab (11 vs. 23%, P = 0.001) and DQB1 risk genotypes (37 vs. 54%, P = 0.003) compared with patients with a family history of both type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (P = 0.05) and CHD (P = 0.031) were more common in FH+(TYPE2) than in FH+(MIXED) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients &lt;60 years old, a family history of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was associated with a reduced risk of CHD independent of age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results were similar when the GADab+ patients were excluded from the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A family history of both type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had a profound influence on the phenotype of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, which suggests a genetic interaction between type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
