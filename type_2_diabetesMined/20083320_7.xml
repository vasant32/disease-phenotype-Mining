<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Analysis of covariance and logistic regression analysis were used to estimate geometric means of hs-CRP and HbA(1c) and odds ratios of prevalent <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> according to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> concentrations, respectively, with statistical adjustment for behavioral factors and liver enzymes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Geometric means of hs-CRP and HbA(1c) were progressively lower with increasing concentrations of serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> in men and women each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An inverse association between serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> and HbA(1c) was slightly attenuated after adjustment for hs-CRP, but still remained highly significant (trend P=0.0004 in men and trend P=10(-5) in women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate-adjusted odds ratios of prevalent <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for the lowest to highest quintiles of serum total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> were 1.00, 1.00, 0.73, 0.80, and 0.73 (trend P=0.002), without adjustment for hs-CRP, and 1.00, 1.04, 0.76, 0.86, and 0.79 (trend P=0.01), with adjustment for hs-CRP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Higher concentrations of serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> probably confer protection against the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
