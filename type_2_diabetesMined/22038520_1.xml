<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Translation of genetic association signals into molecular mechanisms for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> has been slow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The glucokinase regulatory protein (GKRP; gene symbol GCKR) P446L variant, associated with inverse modulation of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>- and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-related traits, has been shown to alter the kinetics of glucokinase (GCK) inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As GCK inhibition is associated with nuclear sequestration, we aimed to determine whether this variant also alters the direct interaction between GKRP and GCK and their intracellular localisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fluorescently tagged rat and human <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT)- or P446L-GCKR and GCK were transiently transfected into HeLa cells and mouse primary hepatocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Whole-cell and nuclear fluorescence was quantified in individual cells exposed to low- or high-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> conditions (5.5 or 25 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interaction between GCK and GKRP was measured by sensitised emission-based fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) efficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: P446L-GKRP had a decreased degree of nuclear localisation, ability to sequester GCK and direct interaction with GCK as measured by FRET compared with WT-GKRP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Decreased interaction was observed between WT-GKRP and GCK at high compared with low <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, but not between P446L-GKRP and GCK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Rat WT-GKRP and P446L-GKRP behaved quite differently: both variants responded to high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> by diminished sequestration of GCK but showed no effect of the P446L variant on nuclear localisation or GCK sequestration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our study suggests the common human P446L-GKRP variant protein results in elevated hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake and disposal by increasing active cytosolic GCK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This would increase hepatic <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> biosynthesis but decrease fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations and provides a potential mechanism for the protective effect of this allele on type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
