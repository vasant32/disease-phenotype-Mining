<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The influence of patient socio-demographic and clinical characteristics on QoL was examined using independent sample t-tests and one-way analysis of variance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> significantly affected the HRQoL of patients included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean score of the total DQOL measure was higher among patients who were less than 40 years of age, male, married, had less than 8 years of education, lived with their family and had no family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similarly, patients with less than 5 years of disease duration, no complications or prior hospitalization, receive insulin, and with HbA(1)c&lt;7 reported significantly better overall HRQoL (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with BMI&lt;24 had higher levels of satisfaction with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than those with BMI&gt;or=24 (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp>-related HRQoL information is clearly of supreme importance to family physicians and policy makers to identify and implement appropriate interventions for achieving better management of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and ultimately improving the QoL of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
