<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the advanced stages of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, a decline in beta-cell mass is also observed, but its mechanism is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Human islets normally express FasL but not the Fas receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We observed upregulation of Fas in beta-cells of type 2 diabetic patients relative to nondiabetic control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vitro exposure of islets from nondiabetic organ donors to high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels induced Fas expression, caspase-8 and -3 activation, and beta-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was blocked by an antagonistic anti-Fas antibody, indicating that <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> is due to interaction between the constitutively expressed FasL and the upregulated Fas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results support a new role for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in regulating Fas expression in human beta-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Upregulation of the Fas receptor by elevated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels may contribute to beta-cell destruction by the constitutively expressed FasL independent of an autoimmune reaction, thus providing a link between type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
