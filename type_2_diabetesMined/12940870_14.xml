<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether dietary supplementation with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18220">isoflavones</z:chebi> from red clover affected ambulatory blood pressure and forearm vascular endothelial function in postmenopausal type 2 diabetic women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Sixteen postmenopausal type 2 diabetics treated with diet or oral hypoglycaemic therapy completed a randomized double-blind crossover trial of dietary supplementation with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18220">isoflavones</z:chebi> from red clover (approximately 50 mg/day) for 4 weeks compared to placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure recordings and forearm vascular responses to <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7596">nitroprusside</z:chebi> and L-nitromonomethylarginine (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28229">L-NMMA</z:chebi>) were measured at the end of each treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean daytime systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly lower during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18220">isoflavone</z:chebi> therapy compared to placebo (-8.0 +/- 3.4 and -4.3 +/- 1.9 mmHg respectively, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The increase in forearm vascular resistance following <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28229">L-NMMA</z:chebi> was significantly greater during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18220">isoflavone</z:chebi> supplementation (20.9 +/- 6.5) than placebo (3.7 +/- 2.9 arbitrary units, p &lt; 0.05), suggesting an improvement in basal endothelial function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi>, glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> and forearm vascular responses to <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7596">nitroprusside</z:chebi> did not differ significantly between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18220">isoflavone</z:chebi> and placebo therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18220">Isoflavone</z:chebi> supplementation from red clover may favourably influence blood pressure and endothelial function in postmenopausal type 2 diabetic women </plain></SENT>
