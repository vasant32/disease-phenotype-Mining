<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Insulin secretion and sensitivity was studied in 28 prepubertal children born <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>small for gestational age</z:hpo> (SGA) and in 22 prepubertal children born appropriate for gestational age (AGA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effect of body size during childhood was also assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity was measured using the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (M value), and beta-cell function was studied with the hyperglycemic clamp plus arginine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>First-phase insulin response (FIR) was used to calculate the disposition index (FIR x M value) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Arginine-stimulated second-phase insulin response was used as a measure of beta-cell capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DeltaBMI(0-1 year), DeltaBMI(0-2 years), and DeltaBMI(2-9 years) were classified in tertiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SGA children were less insulin sensitive than AGA children (P = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>beta-Cell capacity and disposition indexes were similar in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In SGA children, M values were lower in the tertile with the highest DeltaBMI(2-9 years) than in the tertile with the lowest DeltaBMI(2-9 years) (P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No association between DeltaBMI(0-2 years) and decreased insulin sensitivity was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, prepubertal SGA children show decreased insulin sensitivity rather than decreased beta-cell capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Interventions to improve fetal growth and prevent overweight after the second year of life appear to be important factors in the prevention of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in children born SGA </plain></SENT>
