<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we addressed the mechanism for this effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In intact cells, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> stimulated phosphorylation of the key regulatory site (Thr-172) on the catalytic (alpha) subunit of AMPK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It did not affect phosphorylation of this site by either of two upstream kinases in cell-free assays, although we were able to detect an increase in upstream kinase activity in extracts of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>-treated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> has been reported to be an inhibitor of complex 1 of the respiratory chain, but we present evidence that activation of AMPK in two different cell types is not a consequence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of cellular energy charge via this mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Whereas we have not established the definitive mechanism by which <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> activates AMPK, our results show that the mechanism is different from that of the existing AMPK-activating agent, 5-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="22512">aminoimidazole</z:chebi>-4-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="23004,37622">carboxamide</z:chebi> (AICA) riboside </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> therefore represents a useful new tool to study the consequences of AMPK activation in intact cells and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results also show that AMPK can be activated by mechanisms other than changes in the cellular <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>-to-ATP ratio </plain></SENT>
