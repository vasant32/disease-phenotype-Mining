<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To directly compare the rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> and metabolic control achieved on once-daily ultralente insulin administration with twice-daily <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin administration in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patient treatment satisfaction and quality of life were also examined before and during each treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A crossover study was performed involving five centers and 79 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &gt; 8 mmol/l) with a 2-month run-in followed by two 6-month periods of either <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> or ultralente insulin administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were managed by a specialist nurse using a dosage adjustment protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HbA1c was lower with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin therapy during each of the 6-month periods (9.7 +/- 0.2 vs. 9.1 +/- 0.3 and 9.8 +/- 0.2 vs. 9.0 +/- 0.3 mmol/l; both P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The difference was accounted for by higher evening <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels with ultralente insulin (fasting 8.2 +/- 0.3 vs. 8.2 +/- 0.3 mmol/l, 6:00 P.M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>11.5 +/- 0.4 vs. 10.6 +/- 0.4 mmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite worse control, the total number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001988'>hypoglycemic episodes</z:hpo> was greater with ultralente insulin (220 vs. 171), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001988'>hypoglycemic episodes</z:hpo> requiring third-party assistance occurred almost entirely with ultralente (14 vs. 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment satisfaction scores increased more with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin compared with ultralente and rose further upon changing to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin, but fell upon changing to ultralente insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These changes were highly significant (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> quality of life improved on both regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data clearly demonstrate the lower <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> rate, better <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control, and greater treatment satisfaction accompanying therapy for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with twice daily <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> compared with once daily ultralente insulin </plain></SENT>
