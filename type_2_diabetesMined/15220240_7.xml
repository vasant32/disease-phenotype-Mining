<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare clinical outcomes obtained using treatment algorithms versus standard "usual care" to treat patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a community setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: An observational group comparison was implemented in three community-based clinics in San Antonio, Texas: 1). a community clinic following treatment algorithms (CC-TA), 2). university clinic following treatment algorithms (UC-TA), and 3). a community clinic following standard "usual care" practices (CC-SC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three hundred fifty-eight recently diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients (90% Mexican American, from low-income neighborhoods) who were consecutively identified at the three clinics were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following medical and laboratory evaluation, participants were started on treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> and followed for 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Decrements in HbA(1c) at 12 months in the CC-TA and UC-TA were 3.1 and 3.3%, respectively, compared to 1.3% in the CC-SC (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Corresponding decrements in fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> at 12 months were 94 and 99 mg/dl, respectively, versus 38 mg/dl in CC-SC (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reductions in total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> at 12 months were greater in both algorithm-managed clinics compared to standard care-managed clinics (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In algorithm-managed clinics, there were 30% more documented eye exams and 24% more documented foot exams than in standard care-managed patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to the treatment algorithms improved metabolic outcomes in type 2 diabetic patients to a greater extent than standard care practices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results have important clinical implications for the treatment of type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
