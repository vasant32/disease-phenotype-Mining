<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine if dietary <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> is associated with risk of incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in young adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used data from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">Potassium</z:chebi> intake was measured by (1) an average of three 24 h urinary <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> collections at the 5-year study visit, and (2) the CARDIA dietary assessment instrument at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> cases were ascertained on the basis of use of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> medication and laboratory measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analyses were adjusted for relevant confounders including intake of fruit and vegetables and other dietary factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 1,066 participants with urinary <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> measurements, 99 (9.3%) developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> over 15 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariate models, adults in the lowest urinary <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> quintile were more than twice as likely to develop <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> as their counterparts in the highest quintile (HR 2.45; 95% CI 1.08, 5.59) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of 4,754 participants with dietary history measurements, 373 (7.8%) developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> over 20 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In multivariate models, African-Americans had a significantly increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with lower <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> intake, which was not found in whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Low dietary <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> is associated with increased risk of incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in African-Americans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Randomised clinical trials are needed to determine if <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> supplementation, from either dietary or pharmacological sources, could reduce the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, particularly in higher-risk populations </plain></SENT>
