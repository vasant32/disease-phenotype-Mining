<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although rare monogenic activating mutations in these genes cause overt neonatal <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the common variants E23K (KCNJ11) and S1369A (ABCC8) form a tightly heritable haplotype that is associated with an increased susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2D) risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the molecular mechanism(s) underlying this risk remain to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A homology model of the SUR1 nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) indicates that residue 1369 is in close proximity to the major MgATPase site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we investigated the intrinsic MgATPase activity of K(ATP) channels containing these variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Electrophysiological and biochemical techniques were used to study the MgATPase activity of recombinant human K(ATP) channels or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> S-transferase and NBD2 fusion proteins containing the E23/S1369 (nonrisk) or K23/A1369 (risk) variant haplotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>K(ATP) channels containing the K23/A1369 haplotype displayed a significantly increased stimulation by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15996">guanosine triphosphate</z:chebi> compared with the E23/S1369 haplotype (3.2- vs. 1.8-fold) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This effect was dependent on the presence of the A1369 variant and was lost in the absence of Mg(2+) ions or in the presence of the MgATPase inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49499">beryllium fluoride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Direct biochemical assays also confirmed an increase in MgATPase activity in NBD2 fusion proteins containing the A1369 variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings demonstrate that the A1369 variant increases K(ATP) channel MgATPase activity, providing a plausible molecular mechanism by which the K23/A1369 haplotype increases susceptibility to T2D in humans homozygous for these variants </plain></SENT>
