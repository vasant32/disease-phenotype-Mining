<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to investigate possible associations of FABP2 A54T polymorphism with T2DM and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in a Greek Caucasian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 242 subjects with T2DM and 188 control subjects were genotyped for the FABP2 A54T polymorphism using PCR-RFLP method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the total subjects included in both groups, 172 were classified as <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (BMI &gt;or= 30 kg/m(2)) and 258 were classified as nonobese (BMI &lt;30 kg/m(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the whole population, 218 subjects (50.7%) were genotyped as AA, 175 subjects (40.7%) as AT, and 37 subjects (8.6%) as TT for the FABP2 A54T polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>According to the dominant model, the frequency of AA genotype was significantly lower in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> than in nonobese subjects (43.0% vs 55.8%, p=0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was observed in genotypes between diabetic and nondiabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>According to the additive model, the presence of TT genotype was significantly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> after adjusting for age, sex, and the presence of T2DM (OR 2.32, p=0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: FABP2 A54T polymorphism may help identify Caucasian subjects at risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
