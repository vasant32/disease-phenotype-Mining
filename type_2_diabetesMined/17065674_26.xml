<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to assess the trends in the mean concentrations of fasting serum insulin and the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> among nondiabetic adults during the periods of 1988-1994 and 1999-2002 in the U.S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted analyses of data among men and nonpregnant women without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> aged &gt;/=20 years from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III; 1988-1994; n = 7,926) and NHANES 1999-2002 (n = 2,993) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both surveys were designed to represent the noninstitutionalized civilian U.S. population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We calculated age-adjusted mean concentrations of fasting insulin and the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> defined using the 75th percentile of fasting insulin among nondiabetic individuals as the cutoff value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The geometric mean concentrations of fasting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020459" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">insulin increased</z:e> by approximately 5% from 1988-1994 to 1999-2002 among nondiabetic adults aged &gt;/=20 years in the U.S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mexican-American men, men and women aged 20-39 years, and non-Hispanic white women had a greater relative increase in the mean concentrations of fasting insulin than their counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> increased by 35.1% overall (38.3% among men and 32.1% among women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In parallel with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> epidemic, concentrations of fasting insulin and prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> have increased remarkably among nondiabetic U.S. adults </plain></SENT>
