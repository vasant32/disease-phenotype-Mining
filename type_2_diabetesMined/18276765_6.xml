<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Protein kinase B/Akt plays a central role in beta-cells, but little is known regarding downstream Akt substrates in these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, Rab GTPase-activating protein AS160, a substrate of Akt, was shown to be involved in insulin modulation of GLUT4 trafficking in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the expression and potential role of AS160 in beta-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: AS160 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was measured in mouse and human islets and fluorescence-activated cell sorted beta-cells and compared in islets from control subjects versus individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For knockdown experiments, transformed mouse insulin-secreting MIN6B1 cells were transfected with pSUPER-GFP plasmid encoding a small hairpin <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> against insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-2, AS160, or a negative control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Primary mouse islet cells were transfected with AS160 small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: AS160 was expressed in human and mouse pancreatic beta-cells and phosphorylated after <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>AS160 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was downregulated in pancreatic islets from individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In MIN6B1 cells, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> induced phosphorylation of Akt and AS160, and this was mediated by insulin receptor/IRS-2/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase independently of changes in cytosolic Ca(2+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Knockdown of AS160 resulted in increased basal insulin secretion, whereas <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin release was abolished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, beta-cells with decreased AS160 showed <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> and loss of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study shows for the first time that AS160, previously recognized as a key player in insulin signaling in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, is also a major effector of protein kinase B/Akt signaling in the beta-cell </plain></SENT>
