<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The current study was conducted to compare the effectiveness of delivering <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> education in either a group or individual setting using a consistent, evidence-based curriculum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 170 subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were randomly assigned to either group (n = 87) or individual (n = 83) educational settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects received education in four sequential sessions delivered at consistent time intervals over a 6-month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Outcomes included changes in knowledge, self-management behaviors, weight, BMI, HbA(1c), health-related quality of life, patient attitudes, and medication regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Changes were assessed at baseline and after the 2-week, 3-month, and 6-month education sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both educational settings had similar improvements in knowledge, BMI, health-related quality of life, attitudes, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other measured indicators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HbA(1c) decreased from 8.5 +/- 1.8% at baseline to 6.5 +/- 0.8% at 6 months (P &lt; 0.01) in the study population as a whole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subjects assigned to the individual setting had a 1.7 +/- 1.9% reduction in HbA(1c) (P &lt; 0.01), whereas subjects assigned to the group setting had a 2.5 +/- 1.8% reduction in HbA(1c) (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The difference in HbA(1c) improvement was marginally greater in subjects assigned to group education versus individualized education (P = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> education delivered in a group setting, when compared with an individual setting, was equally effective at providing equivalent or slightly greater improvements in glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Group <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> education was similarly effective in delivering key educational components and may allow for more efficient and cost-effective methods in the delivery of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> education programs </plain></SENT>
