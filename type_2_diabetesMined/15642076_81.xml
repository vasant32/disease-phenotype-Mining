<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a 26-week, multinational, open-label, parallel group trial with 505 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (mean age, 60.4 +/- 8.6 years; mean BMI, 30.4 +/- 5.3 kg/m(2); mean HbA(1c), 7.9 +/- 1.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients, randomized 2:1 to insulin detemir or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin, received basal insulin either once or twice daily according to their pretrial insulin treatment and insulin aspart at mealtimes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 26 weeks of treatment, significant reductions in HbA(1c) were observed for insulin detemir (0.2%-points, p = 0.004) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin (0.4%-points; p = 0.0001); HbA(1c) levels were comparable at study end (insulin detemir, 7.6%; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin, 7.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number of basal insulin injections administered per day had no effect on HbA(1c) levels (p = 0.50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine-point self-measured blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (SMBG) profiles were similar for the two treatment groups (p = 0.58), as were reductions in fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) (insulin detemir, 0.5 mmol/l; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin, 0.6 mmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At study end, FPG concentrations were similar for the two treatment groups (p = 0.66) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By contrast, within-subject day-to-day variation in fasting SMBG was significantly lower with insulin detemir (p = 0.021) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, patients receiving insulin detemir gained significantly less body weight than those who were administered <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin (1.0 and 1.8 kg, respectively, p = 0.017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The frequency of adverse events and the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> were comparable for the two treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, treated for 26 weeks with insulin detemir plus insulin aspart at mealtimes, experienced comparable glycaemic control but significantly lower within-subject variability and less <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> compared to patients treated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin and insulin aspart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Insulin detemir was well tolerated and had a similar safety profile to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin </plain></SENT>
