<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In elderly subjects, IGT and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are both independently associated with the occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Endothelial damage precedes atherosclerotic changes of the vascular wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, several markers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> were examined in elderly subjects with IGT and elderly patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Von Willebrand</z:e> factor (vWF), tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1), and thrombomodulin were studied as markers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> in a population-based study of elderly subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (NGT) or IGT and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition to these endothelium-dependent factors, we also investigated tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) activity in relation to metabolic parameters and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> data were adjusted for age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increased levels of vWF antigen, t-PA antigen, and PAI-1 activity were seen in the IGT and diabetic group compared with the NGT group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TFPI activity and thrombomodulin levels were increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> elderly subjects, and no differences were seen between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a positive association between HbA(1c) and TFPI activity and vWF antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels correlated with vWF antigen, t-PA antigen, and PAI-1 activity, whereas urine albumin excretion correlated with TFPI activity, vWF antigen, and PAI-1 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Serum insulin levels correlated strongly not only with vWF antigen and t-PA antigen but also with PAI-1 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This correlation did not change after further adjustment for serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and HbA(1c), which may suggest that in the elderly subjects, impaired fibrinolysis is probably associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were no associations between the endothelium-dependent hemostatic factors and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, except for a negative correlation between <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> and thrombomodulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In elderly subjects with IGT, several endothelium-dependent hemostatic factors are already consistently increased, indicating endothelial damage in this stage </plain></SENT>
