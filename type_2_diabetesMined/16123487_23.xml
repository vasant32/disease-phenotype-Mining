<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Hepatic lipase plays a key role in hydrolyzing <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> present in circulating plasma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Plasma hepatic lipase activity is known to be regulated by several hormonal and metabolic factors, but hepatic lipase responsiveness to insulin is still controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hypoadiponectinemia is known to be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These conditions are often characterized by high plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003233'>low HDL cholesterol</z:hpo> levels, and they have been shown to be associated with high plasma hepatic lipase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We therefore raised the question whether adiponectin may be associated with plasma hepatic lipase activity in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We measured plasma adiponectin and postheparin hepatic lipase activity in 206 nondiabetic men and in a second group of 110 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The correlation of these parameters with markers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In nondiabetic patients, adiponectin levels were significantly inversely correlated with plasma hepatic lipase activity (r = -0.4, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results were confirmed in the group of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (r = -0.32, P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed that adiponectin was the strongest factor influencing hepatic lipase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The association was independent of age, sex, BMI, plasma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, insulin, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and accounted for approximately 10 and 12% of the variation in hepatic lipase activity in the two different patient cohorts, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate for the first time a significant inverse association between adiponectin and postheparin plasma hepatic lipase activity that is independent of other factors such as markers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Therefore, adiponectin, rather than insulin, may represent an important factor contributing to the regulation of hepatic lipase activity in both nondiabetic individuals and patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The effect of adiponectin on hepatic lipase activity may also help to explain the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>-elevating action of adiponectin </plain></SENT>
