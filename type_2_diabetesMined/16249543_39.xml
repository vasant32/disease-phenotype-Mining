<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to compare laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) and conventional diet (No-LAGB) in the prevention (primary intervention study; 56 vs. 29 patients) and remission (secondary intervention study; 17 vs. 20 patients) of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in grade 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in a 4-year study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The subjects (n = 122; age 48.5 +/- 1.05 years; BMI 45.7 +/- 0.67 kg/m2) underwent a diagnostic workup, including psychological and psychiatric assessments, in preparation for the LAGB procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 122 subjects, 73 had the surgery (LAGB group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The control group (No-LAGB group) consisted of the 49 subjects who refused the surgery but agreed to be followed up; 6 of these subjects dropped out by the 2nd year of the study, so that the final number of patients was 73 and 43 in the LAGB and No-LAGB groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had a yearly visit and oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From baseline to the end of the 4-year follow-up, BMI decreased from 45.9 +/- 0.89 at baseline to 37.7 +/- 0.71 kg/m2 in the LAGB group and remained steady in the No-LAGB group (from 45.2 +/- 1.04 to 46.5 +/- 1.37 kg/m2), with no significant differences between the primary and secondary intervention groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the primary intervention study, five of the No-LAGB subjects (17.2%) and none of the LAGB subjects (0.0%; P = 0.0001) progressed to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; in the secondary intervention study, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> remitted in one No-LAGB patient (4.0%) and seven LAGB patients (45.0%; P = 0.0052) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> occurred in 11 No-LAGB patients (25.6%) and 1 LAGB patient (1.4%; P = 0.0001) and remitted in 1 No-LAGB (2.3%) and 15 LAGB patients (20.5%; P = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A study of body mass composition revealed a significant reduction of fat mass and a transitory, but not significant, decrease of fat-free mass in LAGB patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In morbid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, sustained and long-lasting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> obtained through LAGB prevents the occurrence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and decreases the prevalence of these disorders </plain></SENT>
