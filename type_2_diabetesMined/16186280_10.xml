<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 69 type 2 diabetic patients were randomly divided into four groups, each group receiving one of the following daily supplement for 3 months: group M (n = 16), 200 mg Mg and 30 mg Zn; group V (n = 18), 200 mg <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> and 100 IU vitamin E; group MV (n = 17), minerals plus vitamins; and group P (n = 18), placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Urinary albumin excretion and N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-beta-d-glucosaminidase activity (NAG) in urine were determined at the beginning and at the end of the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment effects were analyzed by general linear modeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Results indicate that after 3 months of supplementation, levels of urinary albumin excretion decreased in the V and MV groups (P = 0.034 and P = 0.005, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Urinary NAG activity did not significantly change in any treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Levels of systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressure significantly decreased in the MV group (P = 0.008, P = 0.017, and P = 0.009, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also, combination of vitamin and mineral supplementation had significant effects in decreasing fasting serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (P = 0.035) and malondialdehyde concentrations (P = 0.004) and in increasing <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> A1 levels (P = 0.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant change in the levels of these parameters in the other three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the results of the present study provide evidence for the effects of <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamins C</z:chebi> and E and also combination of <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi>, zinc, and <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamins C</z:chebi> and E supplementation on improvement of glomerular but not tubular renal function in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
