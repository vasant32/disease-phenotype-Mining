<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of dose ranges of the DPP-4 inhibitor saxagliptin (BMS-477118) in patients with T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a 12-week, multicentre, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 152 out-patient US study centres, 338 (low-dose cohort) and 85 (high-dose cohort) drug-naive patients with T2DM and inadequate glycaemic control (baseline HbA1c &gt; or =6.8 and &lt; or =9.7%) were randomized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following a 2-week washout, patients received saxagliptin 2.5, 5, 10, 20 or 40 mg once daily, or placebo, for 12 weeks (low-dose cohort) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a second cohort, patients received saxagliptin 100 mg once daily, or placebo, for 6 weeks (high-dose cohort) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The main outcome measure was saxagliptin dose response assessed as change from baseline in HbA1c following double-blind treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treatment arms, saxagliptin significantly reduced HbA1c by 0.7-0.9% from an average baseline of 7.9% vs. placebo (0.3% reduction) in the low-dose cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Placebo-subtracted HbA1c reductions were 0.45-0.63% (low-dose cohort) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Saxagliptin had significant placebo-subtracted reductions in fasting serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (14-25 mg/dl) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels at 60 min following a standard liquid meal test were reduced by 24-41 mg/dl vs. placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Saxagliptin was weight neutral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Adverse events were similar across treatment groups, including placebo, with a very low incidence of confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> in saxagliptin treatment arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Saxagliptin effectively improved glycaemic control in drug-naive patients with T2DM and was generally safe, with a tolerability profile similar to placebo </plain></SENT>
