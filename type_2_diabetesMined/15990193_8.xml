<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Extracellular <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (EC-SOD) is found in the extracellular matrix of tissues and the major scavenger of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> radical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate the role of genetic variability for the pathogenesis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we scanned the protein coding exon and flanking introns of EC-SOD gene for mutation in Japanese type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We identified two missense mutations, Ala40Thr (GCG--&gt;ACG) and Arg213Gly (CGG--&gt;GGG), and a silent mutation, Leu53Leu (CTG--&gt;TTG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For one of these variants, the Ala40Thr polymorphism, the frequency of Thr allele and the number of subjects with Thr allele (Ala/Thr+Thr/Thr) were higher in type 2 diabetic patients (n=205) than those in non-diabetic subjects (n=220) (33.2% versus 24.1%, p=0.003 and 55.6% versus 42.7%, p=0.008, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients with Thr allele also showed earlier age at diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (42.2+/-7.8 years versus 44.4+/-6.9 years, p=0.037) and higher prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (53.5% versus 38.5%, p=0.032) than those without the allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity, furthermore, was evaluated in 71 type 2 diabetic patients with short insulin tolerance test (SITT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patients with Thr allele showed lower insulin sensitivity (Kitt value of SITT) than those without the allele (1.78+/-0.78%/min versus 2.33+/-1.02%/min, p=0.012), although no significant differences in other clinical and biochemical characteristics were observed between two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the genetic variant of EC-SOD gene is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and the susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
