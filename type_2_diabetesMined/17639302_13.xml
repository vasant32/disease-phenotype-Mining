<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Relatively little is known about factors that influence endogenous circulating sRAGE in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the impact of improving glycaemic control on serum total sRAGE and endogenous secretory RAGE (esRAGE), a splice variant of sRAGE, and compared the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> with that of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A randomised, open-label, parallel group study was performed with 64 participants randomised to receive add-on therapy with either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum total sRAGE and esRAGE and metabolic parameters were measured before and after 6 months of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At 6 months, both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> resulted in a significant reduction in HbA(1c), fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and AGE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, significant increases in total sRAGE and esRAGE were only seen in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As a result, serum esRAGE was higher in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> group than in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> group at 6 months (p &lt; 0.01), whereas the differences in sRAGE between the two groups did not reach statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Stepwise linear regression analysis showed that treatment modality made a greater contribution than the changes in HbA(1c) to the subsequent changes in esRAGE levels at 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Treating type 2 diabetic patients with thiazolidinedione can increase circulating levels of esRAGE and sRAGE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Whether modulation of circulating sRAGE has a beneficial effect on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> will have to be evaluated in long-term prospective studies </plain></SENT>
