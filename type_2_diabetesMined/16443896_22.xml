<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Risk scores based on phenotypic characteristics to identify individuals at high risk of having undiagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have been developed in Caucasian populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The impact of known risk factors on having undiagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> differs between populations from different ethnic origin, and risk scores developed in Caucasians may not be applicable to other ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated the performance of one risk score in nine populations of diverse ethnic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data provided by centers from around the world to the DETECT-2 project were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The database includes population-based surveys with information on at least 500 people without known <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> having a 75-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To date, 52 centers have contributed data on 190,000 individuals from 34 countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this analysis, nine cross-sectional studies were selected representing diverse ethnic and regional backgrounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The risk score assessed uses information on age, sex, blood pressure treatment, and BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: This analysis included 29,758 individuals; 1,805 individuals had undiagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The performance of the risk score varied widely, with sensitivity, specificity, and percentage needing further testing ranging between 12 and 57%, 72 and 93%, and 2 and 25%, respectively, with the worse performance in non-Caucasian populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This variation in performance was related to differences in the association between prevalence of undiagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and components of the risk score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A typical risk score developed in Caucasian populations cannot be applied to other populations of diverse ethnic origins </plain></SENT>
