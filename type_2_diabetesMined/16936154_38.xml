<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In vitro <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>-induced MG formation and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> could be blocked by benfotiamine, but in vivo effects of benfotiamine on postprandial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> and MG synthesis have not been investigated in humans until now </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Thirteen people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were given a heat-processed test meal with a high AGE content (HAGE; 15.100 AGE kU, 580 kcal, 54 g protein, 17 g <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, and 48 g carbohydrates) before and after a 3-day therapy with benfotiamine (1,050 mg/day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Macrovascular flow-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> (FMD) and microvascular reactive hyperemia, along with serum markers of endothelial disfunction (E-selectin, vascular cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1, and intracellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1), <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, AGE, and MG were measured during both test meal days after an overnight fast and then at 2, 4, and 6 h postprandially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The HAGE induced a maximum reactive hyperemia decrease of -60.0% after 2 h and a maximum FMD impairment of -35.1% after 4 h, without affecting endothelium-independent vasodilatation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effects of HAGE on both FMD and reactive hyperemia were completely prevented by benfotiamine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum markers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, as well as AGE, increased after HAGE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These effects were significantly reduced by benfotiamine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms micro- and macrovascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> accompanied by increased <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> following a real-life, heat-processed, AGE-rich meal in individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and suggests benfotiamine as a potential treatment </plain></SENT>
