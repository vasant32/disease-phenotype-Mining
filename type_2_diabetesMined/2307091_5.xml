<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001278'>orthostatic hypotension</z:hpo> and its association with glycemic control, as assessed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1 (HbA1) concentration, in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001278'>orthostatic hypotension</z:hpo> in 886 diabetics who were referred to our study and in 587 diabetics who were not given any <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive drugs</z:chebi> was 7% and 6%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001278'>orthostatic hypotension</z:hpo> and HbA1 levels was evaluated only in subjects not receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive drugs</z:chebi>, since <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive agents</z:chebi> might induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0001278'>orthostatic hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HbA1 levels were 11.0 +/- 2.1% in the diabetic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001278'>orthostatic hypotension</z:hpo>, which was significantly higher than the HbA1 levels of 9.9 +/- 2.2% in the diabetic patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001278'>orthostatic hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis also revealed that the association remained significant after adjustment for the treatment and duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, age, sex and body mass index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that glycemic control contributes to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001278'>orthostatic hypotension</z:hpo> in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
