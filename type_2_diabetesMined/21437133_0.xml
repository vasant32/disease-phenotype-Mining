<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prevalence and incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in youth have been increasing, and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is one of the most challenging complications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Comprehensive lifestyle interventions that include attention to dietary change, increased physical activity and behavior change appear to be required for the successful treatment of pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In particular, aspects of behavioral interventions that have been identified as contributing to effectiveness have included intensity, parent/family participation, addressing healthy dietary change, promoting physical activity, and involving behavioral management principles such as goal setting </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in children is most commonly managed with lifestyle modification and medications, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and/or insulin, the only medications currently approved for use in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, many opportunities exist for ongoing research to clarify optimal management for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in youth </plain></SENT>
