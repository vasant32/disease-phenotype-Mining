<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> genetics researchers have made extraordinary progress in identifying common genetic variants that are associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, which has shed light on the biological pathways in which molecular defects that cause the disease likely reside </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the expectation that genetic discoveries will aid the prevention or treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> has not, so far, been fulfilled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a paper published in this edition of the journal, Vassy and colleagues (DOI: 10.1007/s00125-012-2637-7) test the hypothesis that the predictive accuracy of established genetic risk markers for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> varies by age, with the predictive accuracy being greatest in younger cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The authors found no substantive support for this hypothesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, a number of interesting questions are raised by their study concerning why risk alleles for a given genotype may differ in younger and older cohorts and why prospective cohort studies may yield results that are inconsistent with those derived from cross-sectional studies; this commentary discusses these points </plain></SENT>
