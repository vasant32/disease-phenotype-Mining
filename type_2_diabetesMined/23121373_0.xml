<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: People with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were not treated with insulin were identified from a US-based employer claims database (1998-2010) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Following initiation of an antidiabetes drug, the occurrence of accidents resulting in hospital visits was compared between people with, and without, claims for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> using multivariable Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for demographics, comorbidities, prior treatments and prior medical service use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additional analyses were stratified by age 65 years or older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of N = 5582 people with claims for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> and N = 27,910 with no such claims were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Accidents resulting in hospital visits occurred in 5.5 and 2.8% of people with, and without, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for baseline characteristics, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> was associated with significantly increased hazards for any accident [hazard ratio (HR) 1.39, 95% CI 1.21-1.59, p &lt; 0.001], accidental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> (HR 1.36, 95% CI 1.13-1.65, p &lt; 0.001) and motor vehicle accidents (HR 1.82, 95% CI 1.18-2.80, p = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In age-stratified analyses, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> was associated with greater hazards of driving-related accidents in people younger than age 65 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> in people aged 65 or older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> receiving antidiabetes drugs without insulin, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> was associated with a significantly higher risk of accidents resulting in hospital visits, including accidents related to driving and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
