<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In terms of pharmacological intervention as part of a primary prevention programme, the risk/benefit assessment must include the potential for adverse effects in a large population of asymptomatic individuals, a significant proportion of whom would not progress to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the absence of treatment and in whom impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> regulation may reflect different underlying pathogenetic mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Improving the balance of risks and benefits in drug interventions will require a greater ability to determine which treatments are likely to safely improve <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> regulation and prevent <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and its adverse cardiovascular outcomes in individual patients </plain></SENT>
