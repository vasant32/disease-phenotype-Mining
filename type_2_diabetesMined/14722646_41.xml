<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Pancreatic beta-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> is a common feature of Type 1 and Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and leptin exerts an anti-apoptotic function in these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The beta-cell line INS-1 was used to test the hypothesis that the adipocyte hormone adiponectin might mediate an anti-apoptotic effect comparable to leptin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> was induced by culturing cells with a cytokine combination (interleukin-1beta/interferon-gamma) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15756">palmitic acid</z:chebi> in absence or presence of leptin or the globular domain of adiponectin (gAcrp30), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: INS-1 cells had a prominent sensitivity towards cytokine- and fatty acid-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, resulting in about three- and six-fold increases in caspase 3 activation and DNA fragmentation, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>gAcrp30 strongly (50-60%) inhibited <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15756">palmitic acid</z:chebi>-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, with a weaker effect against cytokine-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> (35%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The same result was observed for leptin with both adipokines being non-additive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reduction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by an inhibitor of IkappaB-kinase (IKK) indicated the involvement of the nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB pathway in both cytokine- and fatty acid-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, however, leptin and gAcrp30 were unable to block NF-kappaB activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cytokine- and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35366">fatty-acid</z:chebi>-induced suppression of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="42471">forskolin</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion was completely prevented through the action of gAcrp30, whereas leptin was only effective against lipotoxicity-mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta-cell dysfunction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: Our data show that gAcrp30 partially rescues beta cells from cytokine- and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35366">fatty-acid</z:chebi>-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and completely restores autoimmune- and lipotoxicity-induced dysfunction of insulin-producing cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We suggest that gAcrp30 exerts its anti-apoptotic function without modulating NF-kappaB activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This novel beta cell protective function of gAcrp30 might serve to counteract autoimmune- and lipotoxicity-induced beta-cell destruction </plain></SENT>
