<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of masked <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in normotensive type 2 diabetic patients on microvascular complications and echocardiographic parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 135 normotensive patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent urinary albumin excretion rate (UAER) measurement, echocardiography, and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with increased daytime blood pressure levels (&gt; or = 135/85 mmHg) were classified as having masked <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of masked <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was 30% (n = 41) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Normotensive and masked hypertensive subjects, based on ambulatory blood pressure, were not different in terms of age, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration, smoking status, BMI, waist circumference, serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, glycemic, or <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The office systolic blood pressure was higher in those with masked <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (127.8 +/- 7.5 vs. 122.9 +/- 10.2 mmHg, P = 0.003) than in the normotensive group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>UAER also was increased in the group with masked <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (21.3 microg/min [range 2.5-1,223.5] vs. 8.1 microg/min [1.0-1,143.0], P = 0.001), as was the interventricular septum (1.01 +/- 0.15 vs. 0.94 +/- 0.13 cm, P = 0.015) and posterior wall (0.96 +/- 0.12 vs. 0.90 +/- 0.10 cm, P = 0.006) thickness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After adjustments for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration, sex, smoking, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, and A1C values, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> associations were sustained for daytime systolic blood pressure but not for office systolic blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Type 2 diabetic patients with masked <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> have higher UAER as well as enlargement of ventricular walls compared with the normotensive patients, according to ABPM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, ABPM is important to identify this high-risk group so as to be able to take interventionist measures </plain></SENT>
