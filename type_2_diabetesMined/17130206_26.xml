<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Determining modifiable risks factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> are a public health priority as we seek to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and related disorders such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> increase with aging and are increasing in the U.S. population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to determine whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> among middle-aged adults without type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Risk in Communities (ARIC) cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Middle-aged adults (aged 45-64 years at baseline) in the ARIC cohort had fasting insulin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> assessed between 1987 and 1989 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at baseline were excluded from analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three tests of cognitive function available at baseline and 6 years later were delayed word recall (DWR), digit symbol subtest (DSS), and first letter word fluency (WF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cross-sectional comparisons and linear regression models were computed for cognitive tests at baseline and change in cognitive test scores to determine whether cognitive function was associated with two measures of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, fasting insulin and homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Linear regression models controlled for age, sex, race, marital status, education level, smoking status, alcohol use, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In unadjusted and adjusted analyses, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> based on fasting insulin and HOMA at baseline was associated with significantly lower baseline DWR, DSS, and WF scores and a greater decline over 6 years in DWR and WF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo> is a potentially modifiable midlife risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
