<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The treatment of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) in elderly people is made more difficult than in their younger counterparts, primarily owing to the impact of co-morbidities, complications and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> as well as technical difficulties with insulin injections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, the treatment approach for elderly patients with T2DM may need to be modified to accommodate co-morbidities and illnesses associated with ageing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Risks associated with insulin therapy, particularly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e>, have traditionally limited the use of insulin in this patient population </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A regimen based on insulin glargine plus oral agents provides clinicians with a tool to help meet therapeutic targets in this population without increasing risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
