<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Caspases are proteolytic enzymes that are closely involved in the induction and execution phases of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, but their role in the development of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> has not been studied previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our study focused on the measurement of activities of multiple caspases in retinas of mice at different durations of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several caspases (including caspases-1, -2, -6, -8, and -9) were activated as early as 2 months of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The caspases activity pattern changed with increasing duration of disease, suggesting a slowly developing caspases cascade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Activities of executioner caspases (e.g., cas-6 and -3) became elevated after longer duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and the induction of cas-3 activity was associated with the duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at which capillary cells begin to show evidence of undergoing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Retinas from patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> likewise showed a significant increase in activities of cas-1, -3, -4, and -6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For comparison, <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> caspases were also measured in experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016952" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">galactosemia</z:e>, another model that develops a diabetic-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The pattern of caspases activation differed between <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016952" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">galactosemia</z:e>, but cas-1 activity became elevated soon after elevation of blood <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18133">hexose</z:chebi> concentration in both </plain></SENT>
