<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We identified an angiotensin-generating system in pancreatic islets and found that exogenously administered <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi>, after binding to its receptors (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> type 1 receptor [AT1R]), inhibits insulin release in a manner associated with decreased islet blood flow and (pro)insulin biosynthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study tested the hypothesis that there is a change in AT1R expression in the pancreatic islets of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-induced type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> model, the db/db mouse, which enables endogenous levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> to impair islet function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Islets from 10-week-old db/db and control mice were isolated and investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, the AT1R <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> was administered orally to 4-week-old db/db mice for an 8-week period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that AT1R <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was upregulated markedly in db/db islets and double immunolabeling confirmed that the AT1R was localized to beta-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">Losartan</z:chebi> selectively improved <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced insulin release and (pro)insulin biosynthesis in db/db islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> treatment delayed the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> in db/db mice, but did not affect the insulin sensitivity of peripheral tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present findings indicate that AT1R antagonism improves beta-cell function and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance in young type 2 diabetic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Whether islet AT1R activation plays a role in the pathogenesis of human type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
