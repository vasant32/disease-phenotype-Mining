<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This trial compared the postprandial serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control of biphasic insulin aspart 30 (BIAsp 30: 30% aspart, 70% protaminated aspart) with that of biphasic insulin lispro 25 (Mix25: 25% lispro, 75% protaminated lispro) and biphasic human insulin 30 (BHI 30: 30% regular insulin, 70% <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin) in insulin-treated subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was an open-labeled, randomized, single-dose, three-way crossover trial of 61 insulin-treated subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who had no significant late <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BIAsp 30 and Mix25 were injected subcutaneously immediately before a test meal, and BHI 30 was injected 15 min before a test meal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary target of analysis was serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excursion 0-5 h after a meal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The postprandial glycemic control with BIAsp 30, as assessed by the 5-h postmeal serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excursion, was superior to that with both BHI 30 and Mix25 (16.6 +/- 4.5 vs. 20.1 +/- 4.9 and 18.9 +/- 6.1 mmol/l per hour, respectively; P &lt; 0.001 and P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For BIAsp 30 versus BHI 30, this was supported by a reduced maximum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration [C(max(SG))] (-5%; P &lt; 0.05) occurring earlier (-13 min; P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, BIAsp 30 displayed a higher maximum serum insulin concentration (+101%; P &lt; 0.001) occurring earlier (-55 min; P &lt; 0.001) compared with BHI 30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with Mix25, there was a shorter time to C(max(SG)) (-11 min; P &lt; 0.05) after treatment with BIAsp 30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This trial demonstrates that BIAsp 30 improves postprandial glycemic control compared with both Mix25 and BHI 30 in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
