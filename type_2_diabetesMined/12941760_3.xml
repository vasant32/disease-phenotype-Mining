<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we demonstrate differential effects of G(M) overexpression in human muscle cells according to <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adenovirus-mediated delivery of G(M) slightly activated <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase (GS) and inactivated <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> phosphorylase (GP) in <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi>-replete cells, causing an overaccumulation of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> and impairment of glycogenolysis after <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Differently, in <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi>-depleted cells, G(M) strongly increased GS activation with no further enhancement of early <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> resynthesis and without affecting GP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Effects of G(M) on GS and GP were abrogated by treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50095">dibutyryl cyclic AMP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression of a COOH-terminal deleted-mutant (G(M) Delta C), lacking the membrane binding sequence to sarcoplasmic reticulum, failed to activate GS in <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi>-depleted cells, while behaving similar to native G(M) in <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi>-replete cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is explained by loss of stability of the G(M) Delta C protein following <z:mpath ids='MPATH_50'>glycogen-depletion</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In summary, G(M) promotes <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> storage and inversely regulates GS and GP activities, while, specifically, synthase phosphatase activity of G(M)-PP1 is inhibited by <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The conditional loss of function of the COOH-terminal deleted G(M) construct may help to explain the reported association of truncation mutation of G(M) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in human subjects </plain></SENT>
