<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Muscle <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction occurs in many insulin-resistant states, such as type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, prompting a hypothesis that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction may cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We determined the impact of insulin deficiency on muscle <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> ATP production by temporarily depriving type 1 diabetic patients of insulin treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We withdrew insulin for 8.6 +/- 0.6 h in nine C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-negative type 1 diabetic subjects and measured muscle <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> ATP production and gene transcript levels (gene array and real-time quantitative PCR) and compared with insulin-treated state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also measured oxygen consumption (indirect calorimetry); plasma levels of glucagon, bicarbonate, and other substrates; and urinary nitrogen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Withdrawal of insulin resulted in increased plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, branched chain amino acids, nonesterified fatty acids, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and urinary nitrogen but no change in bicarbonate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Insulin deprivation decreased muscle <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> ATP production rate (MAPR) despite an increase in whole-body oxygen consumption and altered expression of many muscle <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> gene transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transcript levels of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation were decreased, whereas those involved in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, cytoskeleton signaling, and integrin signaling pathways were increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Insulin deficiency and associated metabolic changes reduce muscle MAPR and expression of oxidative phosphorylation genes in type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> despite an increase in whole-body oxygen consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increase in transcript levels of genes involved in VEGF, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, cytoskeleton, and integrin signaling pathways suggest that vascular factors and cell proliferation that may interact with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> changes occurred </plain></SENT>
