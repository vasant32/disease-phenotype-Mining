<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the financial and clinical benefits of implementing information technology (IT)-enabled disease management systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A computer model was created to project the impact of IT-enabled disease management on care processes, clinical outcomes, and medical costs for patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> aged &gt;25 years in the U.S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several ITs were modeled (e.g., <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> registries, computerized decision support, remote monitoring, patient self-management systems, and payer-based systems) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Estimates of care process improvements were derived from published literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Simulations projected outcomes for both payer and provider organizations, scaled to the national level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was medical cost savings, in 2004 U.S. dollars discounted at 5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Secondary measures include reduction of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> forms of IT-enabled disease management improved the health of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and reduced health care expenditures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Over 10 years, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> registries saved $14.5 billion, computerized decision support saved $10.7 billion, payer-centered technologies saved $7.10 billion, remote monitoring saved $326 million, self-management saved $285 million, and integrated provider-patient systems saved $16.9 billion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: IT-enabled <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> management has the potential to improve care processes, delay <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> complications, and save health care dollars </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of existing systems, provider-centered technologies such as <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> registries currently show the most potential for benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Fully integrated provider-patient systems would have even greater potential for benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These benefits must be weighed against the implementation costs </plain></SENT>
