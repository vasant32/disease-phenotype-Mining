<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although techniques for analyzing <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> subfractions are not likely to be used in clinical practice, a prediction of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> size based on a regular <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile may be useful for assessment of cardiovascular risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Sixty patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with acceptable glycemic control and an <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> level &gt; or = 1 mmol/l were recruited after cessation of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-altering treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> size was determined by 2-20% PAGE; patients having small <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> (n = 30) were compared with those having intermediate or large <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> (n = 30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Clinical characteristics, pharmacological therapies, lifestyle, and prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related complications were similar in both patient groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> size correlated negatively with plasma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (TGs) (R2 = 0.52) and positively with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (R2 = 0.14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, an inverse correlation between the TG-to-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> molar ratio and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> size was even stronger (R2 = 0.59) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ratio was &gt; 1.33 in 90% of the patients with small <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> particles (95% CI 79.3-100) and 16.5% of those with larger <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> particles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A cutoff point of 1.33 for the TG-to-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> ratio distinguishes between patients having small <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> values better than TG cutoff of 1.70 and 1.45 mmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The TG-to-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> ratio may be related to the processes involved in <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> size pathophysiology and relevant with regard to the risk of clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It may be suitable for the selection of patients needing an earlier and aggressive treatment of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> abnormalities </plain></SENT>
