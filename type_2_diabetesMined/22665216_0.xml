<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Yet, the compensatory role of central locomotor circuits remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that walking outcomes would be more closely related to regional gray matter volumes in older adults with DPN as compared with nonneuropathic diabetic patients and nondiabetic control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Clinically important outcomes of walking (i.e., speed, stride duration variability, and double support time) were measured in 29 patients with DPN (type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with foot-sole somatosensory impairment), 68 diabetic (DM) patients (type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with intact foot-sole sensation), and 89 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Global and regional gray matter volumes were calculated from 3 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: DPN subjects walked more slowly (P = 0.005) with greater stride duration variability (P &lt; 0.001) and longer double support (P &lt; 0.001) as compared with DM and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> was associated with less cerebellar gray matter volume (P &lt; 0.001), but global gray matter volume was similar between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DPN subjects with lower gray matter volume globally (P &lt; 0.004) and regionally (i.e., cerebellum, right-hemisphere dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, basal ganglia, P &lt; 0.005) walked more slowly with greater stride duration variability and/or longer double support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Each relationship was stronger in DPN than DM subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In control subjects, brain volumes did not relate to walking patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Strong relationships between brain volumes and walking outcomes were observed in the DPN group and to a lesser extent the DM group, but not in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Individuals with DPN may be more dependent upon supraspinal elements of the motor control system to regulate several walking outcomes linked to poor health in elderly adults </plain></SENT>
