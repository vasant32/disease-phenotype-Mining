<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Compared with men and women without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have higher bone mineral density (BMD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, they may still be at increased risk for hip fractures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using population-based Ontario health care data, we compared the risk of hip fractures among men and women with and without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using a retrospective cohort design, we identified Ontario residents aged &gt; or =66 years with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from a validated registry from 1994 to 1995 (n = 197,412) and followed them for their first hip fracture until 31 March 2003 (mean 6.1-year follow-up) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hip fracture rates were compared with those of age-matched Ontario residents without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 401,400), and results were stratified by sex and adjusted for age and other covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with individuals without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, individuals with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had greater comorbidity, were less likely to have had a BMD test, and were more likely to be taking medications that increase risk of falling and decrease BMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for these differences and age, we found that <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> increased fracture risk in both men (hazard ratio 1.18 [95% CI 1.12-1.24], P &lt; 0.0001) and women (1.11 [1.08-1.15], P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Men and women with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have a higher risk of hip fractures compared with individuals without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further research to elucidate the mechanisms underlying this increased risk of fracture is needed, as well as increased attention to fracture prevention strategies in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
