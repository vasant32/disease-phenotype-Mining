<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on previous association studies, we present evidence that with an estimated attributable proportion of 15% in Caucasians, E23K in K(IR)6.2 appears to be the most important genetic risk factor for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> yet identified </plain></SENT>
