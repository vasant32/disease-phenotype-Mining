<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because the synergic action of insulin and exercise has been shown to be decreased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, the aim of this study was to compare the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> on muscle insulin responsiveness at rest and during exercise in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, 45 patients with newly diagnosed or diet-treated type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were randomized for treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> (4 mg b.i.d.), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (1 g b.i.d.), or placebo in a 26-week double-blind trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Skeletal muscle <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake was measured using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">fluorine-18</z:chebi>-labeled fluoro-deoxy-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) during euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp and one-legged exercise before and after the treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">Rosiglitazone</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.05) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.0001) treatment lowered the mean glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The skeletal muscle <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake was increased by 38% (P &lt; 0.01) and whole-body <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake by 44% in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the exercise-induced increment during insulin stimulation was enhanced by 99% (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No changes were observed in skeletal muscle or whole-body insulin sensitivity in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> but not <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> 1) improves insulin responsiveness in resting skeletal muscle and 2) doubles the insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake rate during physical exercise in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> improves synergic action of insulin and exercise </plain></SENT>
