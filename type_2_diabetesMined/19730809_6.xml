<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the effects of aspirin treatment on inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (iNOS)-mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and on S-nitrosylation of insulin receptor (IR)-beta, IRS-1 and protein kinase B (Akt) in the muscle of diet-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> rats and also in iNos (also known as Nos2)-/- mice on high fat diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Aspirin (120 mg kg-1 day-1 for 2 days) or iNOS inhibitor (L-NIL; 80 mg/kg body weight) were administered to diet-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> rats or mice and iNOS production and insulin signalling were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>S-nitrosylation of IRbeta/IRS-1 and Akt was investigated using the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> switch method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: iNOS protein levels increased in the muscle of diet-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> rats, associated with an increase in S-nitrosylation of IRbeta, IRS-1 and Akt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These alterations were reversed by aspirin treatment, in parallel with an improvement in insulin signalling and sensitivity, as measured by insulin tolerance test and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conversely, while aspirin reversed the increased phosphorylation of IkappaB kinase beta and c-Jun amino-terminal kinase, as well as IRS-1 serine phosphorylation in diet-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> rats and iNos -/- mice on high-fat diet, these alterations were not associated with the improvement of insulin action induced by this drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our data demonstrate that aspirin treatment not only reduces iNOS protein levels, but also S-nitrosylation of IRbeta, IRS-1 and Akt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These changes are associated with improved <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and signalling, suggesting a novel mechanism of insulin sensitisation evoked by aspirin treatment </plain></SENT>
