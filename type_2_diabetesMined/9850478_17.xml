<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A number of cross-sectional and prospective studies that compared the insulin sensitivity of various national and ethnic populations within the U.S. to the total U.S. population were analyzed to find possible risk factors for the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was found that the risks for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in African-Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans are approximately 2, 2.5, and 5 times greater, respectively, than in Caucasians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Studies of the prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic whites in San Antonio showed that there is an inverse relationship between socioeconomic status and the prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It also appears that cultural effects lead to an increased incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in these populations, which may lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genetic factors may also be a contributing factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A 5-year, prospective study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in Pima Indians showed a relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> and subsequent development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a 7-year study in Mexican Americans, those subjects who had both high insulin secretion and impaired insulin sensitivity had a 14-fold increased risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Regardless of cultural and ethnic factors, the San Antonio Heart Study, which compared Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic whites, showed that in both groups, the strongest predictors of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are elevated fasting insulin concentrations and low insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
