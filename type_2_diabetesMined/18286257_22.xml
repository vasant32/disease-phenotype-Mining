<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined a panel of markers widely used to identify progenitor and/or stem cells, and determined their association with disease severity in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since expression of chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4) has been associated with mobilisation and recruitment of progenitor cells, CXCR4 expression was also analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 98 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 39 control individuals were analysed by flow cytometry for surface marker expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cells expressing different combinations of progenitor and/or stem cell markers were severely reduced in PBMCs of diabetic patients compared with those of control participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a number of these putative progenitor cell populations were negatively associated with disease severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reduced expression of CXCR4 and CD34/CXCR4-positive cells was also observed in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PBMCs expressing CXCR4 positively correlated with levels of progenitor cells in control participants but not in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Levels of putative progenitor and CXCR4-positive cells were further decreased in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e>, including cardiovascular and microvascular diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: A generalised decrease in a range of progenitor cell populations was observed in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This reduction was also negatively associated with disease severity </plain></SENT>
