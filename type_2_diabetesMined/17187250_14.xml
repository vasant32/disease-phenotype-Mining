<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genes involved in OXPHOS have been reported to be down-regulated in skeletal muscle from patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; however, hepatic regulation is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analysed expression of genes involved in OXPHOS from the livers of 14 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 14 subjects with NGT using serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) and DNA chip analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the correlation between expression levels of genes involved in OXPHOS and the clinical parameters of individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and NGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both gene analyses showed that genes involved in OXPHOS were significantly upregulated in the type 2 diabetic liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the SAGE analysis, tag count comparisons of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> transcripts showed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18111">ribosomal RNAs</z:chebi> (rRNA) were 3.5-fold over-expressed, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> were 1.2-fold over-expressed in the type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> library </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DNA chip analysis revealed that expression of genes involved in OXPHOS, which correlated with several nuclear factors, including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>-related receptor-alpha or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma, was a predictor of fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, independently of age, BMI, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and fasting insulin levels (p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, genes involved in OXPHOS did not correlate with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1alpha or nuclear respiratory factor 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our results indicate that upregulation of genes involved in OXPHOS in the liver, which are regulated by different mechanisms from genes in the skeletal muscle, is associated with fasting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
