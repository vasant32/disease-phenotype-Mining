<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One hypothesis is that variation in TCF7L2 impairs insulin processing in the beta cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the association of related TCF7L2 polymorphisms with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> is controversial in that it has only been shown in cohorts susceptible to ascertainment bias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We reproduced the association of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-associated variants with proinsulin/insulin ratios, and also examined the association of a TCF7L2 haplotype with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in the Framingham Heart Study (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FHS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We genotyped the TCF7L2 single nucleotide polymorphisms rs7903146 and rs12255372 (previously associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) and rs10885406 and rs7924080 (which tag haplotype A [HapA], a haplotype reported to be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>) in 2,512 FHS participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used age- and sex-adjusted linear mixed-effects models to test for association with glycaemic traits, proinsulin/insulin ratios and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: As expected, the T risk allele of rs7903146 was associated with higher fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>T/T homozygotes had a 23.5% increase in the proinsulin/insulin ratio (p = 1 x 10(-7)) compared with C/C homozygotes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no association of HapA with BMI (p = 0.98), waist circumference (p = 0.89), subcutaneous adipose tissue (p = 0.32) or visceral adipose tissue (p = 0.92) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We confirmed that the risk allele of rs7903146 is associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> and a higher proinsulin/insulin ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We did not detect any association of the TCF7L2 HapA with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> measures, suggesting that this may have been a spurious association from ascertainment bias, possibly induced by the evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in separate groups of glycaemic cases and controls </plain></SENT>
