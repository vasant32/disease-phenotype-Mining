<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 73 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were examined with the NDS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Monofilaments and biothesiometry were used as clinical standards for PNP to modify the NDS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 43 men and 30 women were studied; mean duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 15 years (1-43), and mean age was 57 years (19-90) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 24 patients had type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and 49 patients had type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinically relevant items were selected from the original 35 NDS items (specific item scored positive in &gt;3 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The resulting 8-item <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011882" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Diabetic Neuropathy</z:e> Examination (DNE) score could accurately predict the results of the clinical standards and is strongly hierarchical (H value 0.53) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity of the DNE at a cut-off level of 3 to 4 were 0.96 and 0.51 for abnormal monofilament scores, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For abnormal vibration perception threshold scores, these values were 0.97 and 0.59, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reproducibility as assessed by inter- and intrarater agreement was good </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The DNE is a sensitive and well-validated hierarchical scoring system that is fast and easy to perform in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
