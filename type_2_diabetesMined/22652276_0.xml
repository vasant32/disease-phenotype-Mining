<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adherence to SEMT guidelines was analysed under medical history, physical examination and laboratory evaluations subheadings, each scored on a 10-point scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Effects of patients' age, gender, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration, body mass index, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> complications, physicians' specialty and institution on guideline adherence were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Follow-up procedures were &gt;75% compliant for 52% of patients </plain></SENT>
