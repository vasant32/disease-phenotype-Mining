<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the biological characteristics of the mutation and the potential functional consequences based on the crystallographic structure of HNF-1alpha in complex with DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: DNA from subjects with a familial form of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was isolated and HNF-1alpha was sequenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The R263L substitution was generated by PCR-based sited-directed mutagenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Functional and biochemical studies were conducted by reporter assay using <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-transporter type 2 (GLUT2) or insulin promoters and electrophoretic mobility shift assay, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Transfection of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> HNF-1alpha increased the reporter activities of GLUT2 and insulin promoters in NIH3T3 and SK-Hep1 cells, while R263L mutant was defective in transactivation of those promoters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> HNF-1alpha and R263L mutant could not transactivate GLUT2 and insulin promoters in MIN6N8 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021670" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">insulinoma</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>R263L mutant had a defective cooperation with its heterodimeric partner HNF-1beta or coactivator p300 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>R263L mutant protein displayed greatly reduced DNA binding ability, despite its comparable protein stability to the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> HNF-1alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: These results suggest that the mutation of HNF-1alpha at codon 263 from arginine to leucine leads to the development of MODY3 through decreased insulin production and defective <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> sensing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings are in good agreement with the crystal structure in which R263 makes hydrogen bonds with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30207">phosphorus atoms</z:chebi> of DNA backbone to mediate the stable binding of HNF-1alpha homeodomain to the promoter </plain></SENT>
