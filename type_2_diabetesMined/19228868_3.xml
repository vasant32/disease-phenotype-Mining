<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Predictors of adult M, measured by the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp, and AIR, measured after a 25-g <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> bolus, were assessed in 76 individuals from a set of childhood data (BMI, systolic blood pressure [sBP] and diastolic blood pressure, cholesterol, fasting and 2-h insulin, and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels during an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After adjustment for sex, adult percent body fat, adult and childhood age, childhood BMI, and sBP were negative and independent predictors of adult M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 5 kg/m(2) increase in childhood BMI was associated with a 7.4% decrease in adult insulin action (95% CI -12.7 to -1.8%, P = 0.01) and a 10-mmHg increase in childhood sBP with a 5.0% decrease in adult M (95% CI -8.4 to -1.4%, P = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After a similar adjustment with M as an additional covariate, childhood 2-h insulin was a positive predictor of adult AIR such that a 25% increase predicted a 7.3% increase in adult AIR (95% CI 1.5-13.5%, P = 0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Childhood insulin response during an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> challenge predicts adult AIR, indicating that beta-cell capacity may be set early in life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Childhood measures related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> predict adult insulin action, which may reflect common underlying mechanisms that may be amenable to modification through programs targeting prevention or treatment of childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
