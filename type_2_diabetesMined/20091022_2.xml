<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesised that K121Q may predict the success of lifestyle intervention in terms of improvement of insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We genotyped 1,563 participants with an increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for K121Q and performed correlational analyses with anthropometric data and variables of insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For metabolic characterisation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants underwent an OGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A subgroup of 506 participants additionally underwent a euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 342 participants, metabolic traits and anthropometric data were re-evaluated after a 9 month lifestyle intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the overall cohort, K121Q was not associated with measures of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, indices of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance during OGTT and insulin sensitivity estimated from the OGTT or derived from a euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp after appropriate adjustment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, K121Q did significantly influence the change in insulin sensitivity during lifestyle intervention after appropriate adjustment (p (additive) = 0.0067, p (dominant) = 0.0027) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Carriers of the minor allele had an impaired increase in OGTT-derived insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A similar trend was obtained for clamp-derived insulin sensitivity, but did not reach significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In our population of European ancestry, the ENPP1 SNP K121Q influenced the change in insulin sensitivity during lifestyle intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, this SNP may determine susceptibility to environmental changes and could predict the success of lifestyle intervention </plain></SENT>
