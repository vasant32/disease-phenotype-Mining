<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Epidemiological analyses have extensively suggested a relationship between glycaemic control and CV events; however, the results of intervention trials have been less conclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The UKPDS reported a 16% reduction in the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, but this reduction was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results of the Kumamoto and PROactive studies could not allow any firm conclusions to be drawn either, because of limited size and the defined primary endpoint, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results of the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> (ACCORD) and Action in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Vascular Disease</z:e>: Preterax and Diamicron Modified Release Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE) trials and the Veteran Administration <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Trial (VADT) were published in rapid succession over the second half of 2008 and at the beginning of 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total number of almost 25,000 type 2 diabetic patients were recruited in these three trials, which assessed the effect of intensive glycaemic control vs conventional treatment on well-defined CV endpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In spite of the achievement and maintenance of strict glycaemic control (HbA(1c) &lt;7.0%), no beneficial effect of intensive therapy was apparent in any of the studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the same time these results were presented, the results of an analysis of the 10 year follow-up of the UKPDS also became available and provided a more optimistic view of the potential benefit of achieving good glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The relative risk reductions for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality were significantly lower in the patients who initially received the intensive treatment compared with those in the conventional treatment arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the initial benefit in terms of microvascular complications observed at the end of the intervention trial remained unaltered at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Once again the debate on the importance of glycaemic control in preventing macrovascular complications remains unsettled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results, however, require some reconciliation, and the objective of this commentary is to analyse a series of elements, including the changes in the treatment approach to CV risk factors in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the effect of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering agents, and the characteristics of the patients included in the different trials, that should be taken into account when interpreting the results of intervention trials in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
