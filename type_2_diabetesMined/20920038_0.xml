<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of insulin therapy to lower blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2D) may depend on a variety of factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aims to determine baseline parameters including body mass index (BMI) threshold that might predict responders to insulin therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a retrospective UK population-based study derived from 358 general practices electronic dataset </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with T2D, diagnosed at the age of &gt;18 years old and who were initiated on insulin from January 2000 to December 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Insulin responders were defined as HbA1c &lt;7.5% and/or HbA1c reduction by &gt;1% at 12 months postinsulin initiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Results are expressed in mean (s.d.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 6032 patients were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Baseline age was 63 years (11.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 61% of patients (3696) responded to insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 1-year postinsulin initiation, HbA1c was significantly reduced (9.8 vs. 8.4%, p &lt; 0.001) and weight increased (85.7 vs. 87.9 kg, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Using logistic regression model, older age (p &lt; 0.001), lower BMI (p = 0.046), higher HbA1c (p &lt; 0.001), basal-bolus insulin therapy and premixed insulin compared to basal insulin alone at baseline were independent predictors of responders to insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Gender and social class were not significant predictors of insulin responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A BMI of &lt;35.3 was derived as a cut-point for response to insulin (p = 0.038) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Overall, insulin therapy confers significant HbA1c reduction and weight increase in patients with T2D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The responsiveness to insulin therapy however appears to depend on baseline age, BMI, HbA1c and insulin regime </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Clinicians should take these factors into consideration when making a decision to initiate insulin therapy in patients with T2D </plain></SENT>
