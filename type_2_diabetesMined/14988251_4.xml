<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transgenic mice overproducing human <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> (apo)A-II, one of the two major apos of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDLs</z:chebi>, display the same <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigated the possible regulation of apoA-II gene expression by <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In primary rat hepatocytes and in HepG2 cells, the transcription of the human apoA-II gene was upregulated by <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This response was mediated by a hormone-responsive element within the enhancer of the apoA-II promoter and was dependent on hepatocyte nuclear factor-4alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, in transgenic mice, the human apoA-II gene is stimulated by a high-carbohydrate diet after fasting and at weaning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By contrast, the apoA-II <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level is not modified in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi>-induced diabetic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In transgenic mice overexpressing the human apoA-II gene, plasma human apoA-II concentration was positively correlated with blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These mice displayed a marked delay in plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance as compared with control mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that the following pathogenic pathway might occur in the course of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>: increased apoA-II level causes a rise in plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> level and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo>, resulting in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, which in turn might further increase apoA-II gene transcription </plain></SENT>
