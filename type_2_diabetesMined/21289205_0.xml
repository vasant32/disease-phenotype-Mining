<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Adiponectin receptor-1 (AdipoR1) expression in skeletal muscle has been suggested to play an important role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed at evaluating the presence of novel AdiopR1 splice variants in human muscle and their regulation under physiological and pathophysiological states </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: AdipoR1 5'UTR <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> transcripts, predicted from bioinformatics data, were evaluated in fetal and adult human tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression and function of the identified transcripts were assessed in cultured human skeletal muscle cells and in muscle biopsies obtained from individuals with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (NGT) and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 49) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Screening of potential AdipoR1 5'UTR splice variants revealed a novel highly abundant muscle transcript (R1T3) in addition to the previously described transcript (R1T1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unlike R1T1, R1T3 expression was significantly increased during fetal development and myogenesis, paralleled with increased AdipoR1 protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 5'UTR of R1T3 was found to contain upstream open reading frames that repress translation of downstream coding sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conversely, AdipoR1 3'UTR was associated with enhanced translation efficiency during myoblast-myotube differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A marked reduction in muscle expression of R1T3, R1T1, and R1T3-to-R1T1 ratio was observed in individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with expression levels of NGT subjects, paralleled with decreased expression of the differentiation marker myogenin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among NGT subjects, R1T3 expression was positively correlated with insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that AdipoR1 receptor expression in human skeletal muscle is subjected to posttranscriptional regulation, including alternative splicing and translational control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These mechanisms play an important role during myogenesis and may be important for whole-body insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
