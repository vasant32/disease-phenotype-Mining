<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to estimate how much at-risk individuals are willing to pay for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> primary prevention programs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: An Internet-based, choice-format conjoint survey was presented to individuals at elevated risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hypothetical <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk-reduction programs included seven features: diet, exercise, counseling, medication, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> goal, risk reduction, and program costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The sample included 582 individuals aged &gt; or =45 years, two-thirds of whom were <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conditional logit models were used to calculate participants' willingness to pay for risk reduction programs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each respondent's self-assessed risk of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was compared with an objective measure based on a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> screening tool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Many respondents underestimated their personal risk of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Those with a low perceived risk were less likely to indicate that they would participate in a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Individuals had the strongest preference for programs with large <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> goals, fewer restrictions on diet, and larger reductions in the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Respondents were willing to pay approximately $1,500 over 3 years to participate in a lifestyle intervention program similar to the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Prevention Program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Individuals with a high perceived risk were willing to pay more than individuals with lower perceived risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Many individuals will be willing to participate in interventions to delay or prevent <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> if the interventions are subsidized, but most will be unwilling to pay the full program cost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our results also offer insights for designing risk-reduction programs that appeal to potential participants </plain></SENT>
