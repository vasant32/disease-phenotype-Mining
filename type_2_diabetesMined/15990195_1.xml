<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) is a non-invasive method for assessing arterial stiffness associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined whether baPWV could improve during a 2-week hospital-based education program in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and whether improvement associates with changes in known atherogenic risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Body mass index (BMI), blood pressure (BP), fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG), insulin, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profiles and baPWV were measured in 32 type 2 diabetic patients before and after an educational program that included advice about nutrition and exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Relationship between the changes in baPWV and additional parameters, 24h-urinary excretion of C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, visceral and subcutaneous fat area by abdominal computer tomography and intima-medial thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) of the carotid artery by ultrasonography, were also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Baseline values of baPWV significantly correlated with age, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, BP, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> and FPG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BaPWV significantly decreased after the program (-120+/-108.4 cm/s, P&lt;0.0001) and this change significantly correlated with that of systolic BP (r=0.697, P&lt;0.0001) and FPG (r=0.452, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that short-term hospitalization with an educational program can improve arterial wall stiffness, perhaps due to improvements in BP and glycemic control </plain></SENT>
