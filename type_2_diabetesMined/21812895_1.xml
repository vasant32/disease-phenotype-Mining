<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To meet glycaemic targets, attempts have been made to improve existing drugs and to develop new classes of drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent advances include insulin analogues that more closely mimic physiologic insulin levels, and incretin-based therapies, which capitalize on the glucoregulatory properties of native glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although promising, these agents are associated with limitations, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> with insulin, gastrointestinal adverse events with GLP-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> and frequent dosing with both classes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Albumin is an abundant natural drug carrier that has been used to improve the half-life, tolerability and efficacy of a number of bioactive agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here, we review the physiologic roles of albumin and how albumin technologies are being used to prolong duration of action of therapies for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, including insulin and incretin-based therapies </plain></SENT>
