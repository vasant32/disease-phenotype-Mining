<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The serum levels of leptin after an overnight fast in 37 adult male Japanese patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (17 smokers and 20 nonsmokers) were assayed using radioimmunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, the serum leptin levels in four nondiabetic smokers were measured before and 2 weeks after quitting smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Smokers and nonsmokers did not differ in age, BMI, or levels of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and fasting insulin but did differ in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> levels (1.07 +/- 0.18 vs. 1.32 +/- 0.24 mmol/l for smokers and nonsmokers, respectively, P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean serum leptin level of smokers did not differ from that of nonsmokers (3.8 +/- 1.9 vs. 3.8 +/- 1.6 ng/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The leptin level correlated with the fasting insulin level and BMI (r = 0.55 and 0.56, P &lt; 0.001 and 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The leptin levels in four heavy smokers showed no change after the subjects quit smoking (3.3 +/- 1.0 vs. 3.8 +/- 1.8 ng/ml, before and after quitting, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Because smoking did not affect the leptin levels, the effects of quitting smoking on the fuel metabolism appear to be due to some other factors </plain></SENT>
