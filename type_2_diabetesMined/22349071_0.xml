<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined (1) insulin signalling in isolated hepatocytes of non-diabetic and type 2 diabetic humans and (2) the effects of two newly developed small molecule PKC-ι inhibitors on aberrant signalling and downstream processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In contrast with PKC-ι deficiency in diabetic muscle, which diminishes <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transport, PKC-ι in diabetic hepatocytes was overproduced and overactive, basally and after insulin treatment, and, moreover, was accompanied by increased abundance of PKC-ι-dependent lipogenic, proinflammatory and gluconeogenic enzymes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Heightened PKC-ι activity most likely reflected heightened activity of IRS-2-dependent phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), as IRS-1 levels and IRS-1/PI3K activity were markedly diminished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Importantly, insulin-stimulated PKC-ι abundance and its overabundance in diabetic hepatocytes was reversed in vitro by both insulin deprivation and PKC-ι inhibitors; this suggested operation of an insulin-driven, feed-forward/positive-feedback mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast with PKC-ι, protein kinase B (Akt2) activity and activation by insulin was diminished, apparently reflecting IRS-1 deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment of diabetic hepatocytes with PKC-ι/λ inhibitors diminished abundance of lipogenic, proinflammatory and gluconeogenic enzymes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that a vicious cycle of PKC-ι overactivity and overproduction exists in hepatocytes of humans with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and contributes importantly to maintaining overactivity of lipogenic, proinflammatory and gluconeogenic pathways, which underlies the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> and carbohydrate abnormalities in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
