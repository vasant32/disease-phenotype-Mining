<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A widely accepted genetically determined <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519106" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">rodent model</z:e> for human type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is the Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rat; however, the lesion(s) in the pancreatic islets of these rats has not been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Herein, intact islets from GK rats (aged 8-14 weeks) were studied, both immediately after isolation and after 18 h in tissue culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite intact contents of insulin and protein, GK islets had markedly deficient insulin release in response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, as well as to pure <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> fuels or a non-nutrient membrane-depolarizing stimulus (40 mmol/l K+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, mastoparan (which activates <z:chebi fb="11" ids="15996">GTP</z:chebi>-binding proteins [GBPs]) completely circumvented any secretory defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Basal and stimulated levels of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16708">adenine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16235">guanine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi>, the activation of phospholipase C by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, the secretory response to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043167" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pertussis</z:e> toxin, and the activation of selected low-molecular weight GBPs were not impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Defects were found, however, in the autophosphorylation and catalytic activity of cytosolic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33838">nucleoside</z:chebi> diphosphokinase (NDPK), which may provide compartmentalized <z:chebi fb="11" ids="15996">GTP</z:chebi> pools to activate G-proteins; a deficient content of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16749">phosphoinositides</z:chebi> was also detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These studies identify novel, heretofore unappreciated, defects late in signal transduction in the islets of our colony of GK rats, possibly occurring at the site of activation by NDPK of a mastoparan-sensitive G-protein-dependent step in exocytosis </plain></SENT>
