<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Eligibility requirements were age &gt; or = 25 years, BMI &gt; or = 24 kg/m2 (&gt; or = 22 kg/m2 for Asian-Americans), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> plus a fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> of 5.3-6.9 mmol/l (or &lt; or = 6.9 mmol for American Indians) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Randomization of participants into the DPP over 2.7 years ended in June 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Baseline data for the three treatment groups--intensive lifestyle modification, standard care plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, and standard care plus placebo--are presented for the 3,234 participants who have been randomized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants, 55% were Caucasian, 20% were African-American, 16% were Hispanic, 5% were American Indian, and 4% were Asian-American </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their average age at entry was 51 +/- 10.7 years (mean +/- SD), and 67.7% were women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, 16% were &lt; 40 years of age, and 20% were &gt; or = 60 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the women, 48% were postmenopausal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Men and women had similar frequencies of history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> (37 and 33%, respectively) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (29 and 26%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the basis of fasting <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> determinations, 54% of men and 40% of women fit National Cholesterol Education Program criteria for abnormal <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>More men than women were current or former cigarette smokers or had a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, 66% of men and 71% of women had a first-degree relative with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Overall, BMI averaged 34.0 +/- 6.7 kg/m2 at baseline with 57% of the men and 73% of women having a BMI &gt; or = 30 kg/m2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Average fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (6.0 +/- 0.5 mmol/l) and HbA1c (5.9 +/- 0.5%) in men were comparable with values in women (5.9 +/- 0.4 mmol/l and 5.9 +/- 0.5%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The DPP has successfully randomized a large cohort of participants with a wide distribution of age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and ethnic and racial backgrounds who are at high risk for developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The study will examine the effects of interventions on the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
