<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Young Chinese diabetic patients (aged &lt;40 years) were recruited from the Prince of Wales Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure, height, weight, and waist and hip circumferences were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Venous blood was sampled for measurements of fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, HbA1c, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, insulin, GH, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A 24-h urine was assayed for urinary albumin excretion (UAE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>General and central <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> was represented by BMI and waist circumference, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo> index was estimated as a product of fasting plasma insulin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with control subjects, diabetic patients were more <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, hyperglycemic, and had worse <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile, higher blood pressures, UAE, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> index, plasma insulin, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> concentrations (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.001) but lower GH concentrations (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When analyzed as a whole group (n = 194), increasing quartiles of waist circumference were associated with increasing trends of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> index, plasma insulin, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> concentrations (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.01) but a decreasing trend of plasma GH concentration (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Using stepwise multiple regression analysis, waist circumference was only associated with sex variable (being higher in men) in the control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the diabetic group, 51% of waist circumference was independently related to male sex and increased plasma insulin and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> concentrations as well as reduced plasma GH levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In young Chinese type 2 diabetic patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598639" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercortisolemia</z:e>, and reduced plasma GH levels were closely associated with central <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Based on these findings, we postulate that maladaptive hormonal responses to rapid changes in lifestyle may have led to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in these young patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, lifestyle-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> may have given rise to these hormonal changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>More studies are required to delineate the nature of these relationships </plain></SENT>
