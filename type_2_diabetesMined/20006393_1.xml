<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe relationships of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vascular calibre with plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We recruited 112 community-based persons aged 44-83years with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, photo-documented <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> status using a digital fundus camera, and measured traditional and novel vascular risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">Retinal</z:chebi> arteriolar and venular calibre and the arterio-venous ratio (AVR) were determined from fundus photographs using a validated computer-assisted method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In adjusted linear regression models, PAI-1 activity was strongly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> measures of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vascular calibre: positively with arterioles (p=0.005) and AVR (p=0.001), and inversely with venules (p=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, wider arterioles were independently associated with waist-hip ratio (p&lt;0.0001), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> (p=0.015), and lower systolic blood pressure (p=0.042), whereas narrower venules were associated with older age and a higher albumin excretion rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neither arteriolar nor venular calibre was associated with plasma total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> or C-reactive protein concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">Retinal</z:chebi> vascular calibre is independently associated with PAI-1 activity in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This finding supports a role for PAI-1 activity in the microvasculature of persons with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and may explain the link between <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vascular calibre and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
