<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Incident users of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> selected from the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Care System West-Friesland (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DCS</z:e>, n = 929) and the Rotterdam Study (n = 182) from the Netherlands, and the CARDS Trial (n = 254) from the UK were genotyped for rs11212617 and tested for an association with both HbA(1c) reduction and treatment success, defined as the ability to reach the treatment target of an HbA(1c) ≤ 7 % (53 mmol/mol) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Finally, a meta-analysis including data from literature was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DCS</z:e> cohort, we observed an association between rs11212617 genotype and treatment success on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.03, 1.58, p = 0.028); in the smaller Rotterdam Study cohort, a numerically similar but non-significant trend was observed (OR 1.45, 95% CI 0.87, 2.39, p = 0.15); while in the CARDS cohort there was no significant association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In meta-analyses of these three cohorts separately or combined with the previously published cohorts, rs11212617 genotype is associated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> treatment success (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.04, 1.49, p = 0.016 and OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.33, 1.38, p = 7.8 × 10(-6), respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: A gene variant near ATM is significantly associated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> treatment response in type 2 diabetic patients from the Netherlands and the UK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is the first robustly replicated common susceptibility locus found to be associated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> treatment response </plain></SENT>
