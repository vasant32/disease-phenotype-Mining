<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated to what extent combined treatment with the human glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) analogue liraglutide and the dual PPARalpha/gamma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> ragaglitazar would improve glycaemic control in overtly diabetic <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety overtly diabetic male ZDF rats were stratified into groups with matched <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA1c) (9.0+/-0.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Liraglutide (15 and 50 microg/kg subcutaneously twice daily), ragaglitazar (1 and 3 mg/kg perorally once daily) and their vehicles were studied as monotherapy and in combination in a 3x3 factorial design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 4-week treatment, synergistic effects on HbA1c, non-fasting morning blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (BG) and/or 24-h BG profiles were observed with three of the four combinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relationship between plasma insulin and BG in combination-treated animals approached that of historical lean ZDF rats representing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis, suggesting that insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity were markedly improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increased insulin immunostaining in islets further supports the improved beta-cell function and/or insulin sensitivity in combination-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The synergistic effect on glycaemic control was found without a similar synergistic increase in beta-cell mass in the combination groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our data demonstrate that combination treatment with a human GLP-1 analogue and a dual PPARalpha/gamma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> through distinct mechanism of actions synergistically improves glycaemic control in the ZDF rat </plain></SENT>
