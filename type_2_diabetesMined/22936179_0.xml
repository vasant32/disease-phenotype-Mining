<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DPP4 has a number of nonenzymatic functions that involve its interaction with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> deaminase (<z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi>) and other extracellular matrix proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we assessed the nonenzymatic role of DPP4 in regulating dendritic cell (DC)/macrophage-mediated adipose <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> humans and rodents demonstrated increased levels of DPP4 expression in DC/macrophage cell populations from visceral adipose tissue (VAT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The DPP4 expression increased during monocyte differentiation to DC/macrophages and with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS)-induced activation of DC/macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The DPP4 colocalized with membrane-bound <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> on human DCs and enhanced the ability of the latter to stimulate T-cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The DPP4 interaction with <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> in human DC/macrophages was competitively inhibited by the addition of exogenous soluble DPP4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Knockdown of DPP4 in human DCs, but not pharmacologic inhibition of their enzymatic function, significantly attenuated the ability to activate T cells without influencing its capacity to secrete proinflammatory cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The nonenzymatic function of DPP4 on DC may play a role in potentiation of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> by interacting with <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest a novel role for the paracrine regulation of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in adipose tissue by DPP4 </plain></SENT>
