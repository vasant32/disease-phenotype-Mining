<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore examined the <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> and renal GH-IGF axis changes in db/db mice, a model of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>Obese</z:mp> and lean animals were followed, beginning at <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, for 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>Albuminuria</z:mp> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance, as well as kidney and glomerular <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tissue protein levels were determined by western blotting and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels by RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum GH and IGF1 levels immediately prior to killing were decreased and liver <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 (Igfbp1) were increased in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Kidney weight was increased in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> animals, associated with hyperfiltration, <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> and glomerular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Administration of a somatostatin analogue (PTR-313) did not improve any of these parameters of diabetic renal involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Renal Igf1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was decreased and renal Igfbp1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein were significantly increased in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Renal insulin-driven levels of phosphorylated forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) were decreased in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Diabetic db/db mice show significant renal changes (and IGFBP1 renal accumulation), similar to the findings in models of type 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A decreased signalling through the insulin receptor and decreased FOXO1 phosphorylation may allow Igfbp1 gene transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These renal changes are associated with low circulating IGF1 and GH levels and unchanged hepatic growth hormone receptor expression, unlike the condition in type 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This suggests that further GH inhibition to modulate renal complications in type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> is not indicated </plain></SENT>
