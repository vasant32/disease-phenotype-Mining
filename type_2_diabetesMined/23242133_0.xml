<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The oscillator properties were assessed in intact islets as well as in beta cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We established a system for long-term bioluminescence recording in cultured human islets, employing lentivector gene delivery of the core clock gene Bmal1 (also known as Arntl)-luciferase reporter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Beta cells were stably labelled using a rat insulin2 promoter fluorescent construct </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Single-islet/cell oscillation profiles were measured by combined bioluminescence-fluorescence time-lapse microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Human islets synchronised in vitro exhibited self-sustained circadian oscillations of Bmal1-luciferase expression at both the population and single-islet levels, with period lengths of 23.6 and 23.9 h, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Endogenous BMAL1 and CRY1 transcript expression was circadian in synchronised islets over 48 h, and antiphasic to REV-ERBα (also known as NR1D1), PER1, PER2, PER3 and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> transcript circadian profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HNF1A and PDX1 exhibited weak circadian oscillations, in phase with the REV-ERBα transcript </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Dispersed islet cells were strongly oscillating as well, at population and single-cell levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Importantly, beta and non-beta cells revealed oscillatory profiles that were well synchronised with each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We provide for the first time compelling evidence for high-amplitude cell-autonomous circadian oscillators displayed in human pancreatic islets and in dispersed human islet cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, these clocks are synchronised between beta and non-beta cells in primary human islet cell cultures </plain></SENT>
