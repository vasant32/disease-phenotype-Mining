<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>How fatty acids affect postprandial insulin, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> concentrations, however, remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to study the effect of fatty acids on postprandial insulin, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Test meals rich in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15756">palmitic acid</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17351">linoleic acid</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16196">oleic acid</z:chebi>, and eicosapentaenoic acid (<z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36005">docosahexaenoic acid</z:chebi> (DHA) and containing 1,000 kcal each were administered in a randomized crossover design to 11 type 2 diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum insulin, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> concentrations were measured for 360 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects received an isoenergetic diet of constant composition throughout the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: According to repeated-measures ANOVA, the insulin (P = 0.0002) but not <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (P = 0.10) response was significantly different between meals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The insulin response was lower to meals rich in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16196">oleic acid</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> and DHA than to meals rich in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15756">palmitic acid</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17351">linoleic acid</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> response did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.06) but tended to be lower with <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> and DHA than with the other fatty acids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similar trends were seen for area under the curve (AUC) and incremental AUC for serum insulin and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, but the differences were not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In comparison with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15756">palmitic acid</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17351">linoleic acid</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16196">oleic acid</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> and DHA may modestly lower insulin response in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> without deteriorating the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> and DHA may also reduce the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> response </plain></SENT>
