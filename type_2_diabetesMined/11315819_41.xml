<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A 5-year Follow-up of a 1-year randomized controlled trial of a reduced-fat ad libitum diet versus a usual diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> (2-h blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> 7.0-11.0 mmol/l) were recruited from a Workforce <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The group that was randomized to a reduced-fat diet participated in monthly small-group education sessions on reduced-fat eating for 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Body weight and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance were measured in 136 participants at baseline 6 months, and 1 year (end of intervention), with follow-up at 2 years (n = l04), 3 years (n = 99), and 5 years (n = 103) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with the control group, weight decreased in the reduced-fat-diet group (P &lt; 0.0001); the greatest difference was noted at 1 year (-3.3 kg), diminished at subsequent follow-up (-3.2 kg at 2 years and -1.6 kg at 3 years), and was no longer present by 5 years (1.1 kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> tolerance also improved in patients on the reduced-fat diet; a lower proportion had type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> at 1 year (47 vs. 67%, P &lt; 0.05), but in subsequent years, there were no differences between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the more compliant 50% of the intervention group maintained lower fasting and 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> at 5 years (P = 0.041 and P = 0.026 respectively) compared with control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The natural history for people at high risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> and deterioration in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This process may be ameliorated through adherence to a reduced fat intake </plain></SENT>
