<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> (TZDs) are increasingly being used for both their blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering properties and their modest beneficial effects on <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (TG) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-modifying efficacy and safety of adding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49040">ezetimibe</z:chebi> to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi>, vs. doubling the dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi>, in TZD-treated T2DM patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind, parallel group, multicentre study in T2DM patients, 30-75 years of age, who had been on a stable dose of a TZD for at least 3 months and had <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> &gt; 2.6 mmol/l (100 mg/dl) prior to study entry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> medications were also allowed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Following 6 weeks of open-label <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> 20 mg/day, patients were randomized to the addition of either blinded <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49040">ezetimibe</z:chebi> 10 mg/day (n = 104) or an additional blinded <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> 20 mg/day (total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> 40 mg/day; n = 110) for 24 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients were stratified according to TZD type and dose (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> 15-30 vs. 45 mg/day; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> 2-4 vs. 8 mg/day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> was reduced more (p &lt; 0.001) by adding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49040">ezetimibe</z:chebi> 10 mg to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> 20 mg (-20.8%) than by doubling the dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> to 40 mg (-0.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="49040">Ezetimibe</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> 20 mg also produced significant incremental reductions in non-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> (p &lt; 0.001), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47773">very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (p &lt; 0.05) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B (p &lt; 0.001) relative to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> 40 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no differences between the groups with respect to changes in TG and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> levels, and both treatments were well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Co-administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49040">ezetimibe</z:chebi> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi>, a dual inhibition treatment strategy targeting both cholesterol synthesis and absorption, is well tolerated and provides greater <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>-lowering efficacy than increasing the dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> in T2DM patients taking TZDs </plain></SENT>
