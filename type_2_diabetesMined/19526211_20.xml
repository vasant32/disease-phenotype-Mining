<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the proportion of this epidemiological difference that can be ascribed to genetic or environmental factors is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine whether genetic ancestry is correlated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk in Latinos, we estimated the proportion of European ancestry in case-control samples from Mexico and Colombia in whom socioeconomic status had been carefully ascertained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We genotyped 67 ancestry-informative markers in 499 participants with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 197 controls from Medell√≠n (Colombia), as well as in 163 participants with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 72 controls from central Mexico </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each participant was assigned a socioeconomic status scale via various measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although European ancestry was associated with lower <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk in Mexicans (OR [95% CI] 0.06 [0.02-0.21], p = 2.0 x 10(-5)) and Colombians (OR 0.26 [0.08-0.78], p = 0.02), adjustment for socioeconomic status eliminated the association in the Colombian sample (OR 0.64 [0.19-2.12], p = 0.46) and significantly attenuated it in the Mexican sample (OR 0.17 [0.04-0.71], p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adjustment for BMI did not change the results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The proportion of non-European ancestry is associated with both type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and lower socioeconomic status in admixed Latino populations from North and South America </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that ancestry-directed search for genetic markers associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Latinos may benefit from information involving social factors, as these factors have a quantitatively important effect on type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk relative to ancestry effects </plain></SENT>
