<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We compared the serum PSA levels in 224 diabetic men with those in 1,293 healthy men and investigated the relationships between serum PSA levels and various variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Except for men aged 40-49 years, serum PSA levels were lower in diabetic men than in healthy men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that age, BMI, and presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were independent determinants of serum PSA level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Serum PSA levels were lower in diabetic men compared with those in healthy men, which is in line with previous reports that patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are at a decreased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
