<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These exocytotic events comprise the trafficking and docking of vesicles to the plasma membrane, followed by fusion triggered by Ca(2+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have unravelled post-docking steps mediated by novel factors, which, by their interactions with soluble <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44485">N-ethylmaleimide</z:chebi>-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE)- and SNARE-associated proteins, confer the docked vesicles fusion competence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These priming steps define the releasable pool of insulin vesicles, which accounts for the first phase of insulin secretion, and controls the rate at which vesicles are replenished for the second phase of secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This article aims to summarize what is currently known about the mechanisms that underlie the priming activity of these proteins, focusing on Munc13, a topic to which we have made some recent contributions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011014'>Abnormal glucose homeostasis</z:hpo> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is because of the failure of islet beta-cells to augment insulin secretion sufficiently to compensate for reduced insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A better understanding of the priming steps may help develop novel approaches to increase insulin secretory capacity and thereby prevent the progression to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
