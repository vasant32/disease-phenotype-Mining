<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our perspective about <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> toxicity as it pertains to the pancreatic beta-cell is that the characteristic decreases in insulin synthesis and secretion are caused by decreased insulin gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The responsible metabolic lesion appears to involve a posttranscriptional defect in pancreas duodenum homeobox-1 (PDX-1) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> maturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PDX-1 is a critically important transcription factor for the insulin promoter, is absent in glucotoxic islets, and, when transfected into glucotoxic beta-cells, improves insulin promoter activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because reactive oxygen species are produced via oxidative phosphorylation during anaerobic glycolysis, via the Schiff reaction during glycation, via <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> autoxidation, and via <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24586">hexosamine</z:chebi> metabolism under supraphysiological <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations, we hypothesize that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> is an important mechanism for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Support for this hypothesis is found in the observations that high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations increase intraislet <z:chebi fb="39" ids="44785">peroxide</z:chebi> levels, that islets contain very low levels of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzyme activities, and that adenoviral overexpression of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzymes in vitro in islets, as well as exogenous treatment with <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> in vivo in animals, protect the islet from the toxic effects of excessive <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinically, consideration of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> as adjunct therapy in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is warranted because of the many reports of elevated markers of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in patients with this disease, which is characterized by imperfect management of glycemia, consequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, and relentless deterioration of beta-cell function </plain></SENT>
