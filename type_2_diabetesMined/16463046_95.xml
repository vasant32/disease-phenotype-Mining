<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A multicompartment model was used to simultaneously determine the kinetic parameters of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (TGs) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B (ApoB) in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>(1) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>(2) after a bolus of [(2)H(3)]leucine and [(2)H(5)]<z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> in ten men with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and in 18 non-diabetic men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Liver fat content was determined by proton spectroscopy and intra-abdominal fat content by MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Univariate regression analysis showed that liver fat content, intra-abdominal fat volume, plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin and HOMA-IR (homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>) correlated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>(1) TG and ApoB production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, only liver fat and plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> were significant in multiple regression models, emphasising the critical role of substrate fluxes and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> availability in the liver as the driving force for overproduction of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>(1) in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite negative correlations with fasting TG levels, liver fat content, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>(1) TG and ApoB pool sizes, adiponectin was not linked to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>(1) TG or ApoB production and thus was not a predictor of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>(1) production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, adiponectin correlated negatively with the removal rates of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>(1) TG and ApoB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We propose that the metabolic effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, partly mediated by depressed plasma adiponectin levels, increases fatty acid flux from adipose tissue to the liver and induces the accumulation of fat in the liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Elevated plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> can further increase hepatic fat content through multiple pathways, resulting in overproduction of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>(1) particles and leading to the characteristic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidaemia</z:e> associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
