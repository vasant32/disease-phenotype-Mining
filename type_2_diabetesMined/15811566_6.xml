<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Participants completed questionnaires that assess self-management and health-related variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>t-Tests were performed for type 1 (DM1) and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DM2</z:e>) separately to compare the mean health scores of individuals who frequently or infrequently perform self-management activities and who do or do not perceive this as a burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Participants frequently perform their self-management activities, particularly injection of insulin (96.1%), following dietary guidelines (70.8%) and eating regularly (65.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dietary self-management is most often seen as a burden (70.4%), while injecting insulin is seen as least burdensome (12.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The perceived burden of self-management is more strongly related to health than the frequency of self-management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Frequency of self-management especially relates to HbA1c% in DM1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>People with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DM2</z:e> who frequently follow the dietary guidelines have more positive health outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Participants who perceive dietary self-management and injecting insulin as a burden have more negative health outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because different relationships were found between frequency and perceived burden of self-management and health indicators, both aspects should be assessed and considered separately when evaluating self-management and examining patient's health </plain></SENT>
