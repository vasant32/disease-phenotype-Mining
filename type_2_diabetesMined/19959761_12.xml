<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 1,066 men and women aged 60-75 years with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and living in Lothian, Scotland (the Edinburgh Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study), was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seven cognitive tests were used to measure abilities in memory, nonverbal reasoning, information processing speed, executive function, and mental flexibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results were used to derive a general intelligence factor (g) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A vocabulary-based test was administered as an estimate of peak prior cognitive ability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results on the cognitive tests were assessed for statistical association with inflammatory markers measured in a venous blood sample at the time of cognitive testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Higher IL-6 and TNF-alpha levels were associated with poorer age- and sex-adjusted scores on the majority of the individual cognitive tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They were also associated with g using standardized regression coefficients -0.074 to -0.173 (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for vocabulary, education level, cardiovascular dysfunction, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and glycemic control, IL-6 remained associated with three of the cognitive tests and with g </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this representative population of people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, elevated circulating levels of inflammatory markers were associated with poorer cognitive ability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>IL-6 levels were also associated with estimated lifetime <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
