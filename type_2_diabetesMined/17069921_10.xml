<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to evaluate efficacy and feasibility of primary care-based <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention model with modest resource requirements in rural Australia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three hundred and eleven subjects with at least a moderate risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> participated in a combined dietary and physical activity intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical measurements and fasting blood samples were taken at the baseline and after intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 3 months intervention, total (change -3.5%, p&lt;0.001) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (-4.8%, p&lt;0.001) plasma levels as well as body mass index (-2.5%, p&lt;0.001), weight (-2.5%, p&lt;0.001), and waist (-1.6%, p&lt;0.001) and hip (-2.7%, p&lt;0.001) circumferences reduced significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A borderline reduction was found in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels (-4.8%, p=0.058) while no changes were observed in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (+0.6%, p=0.525), <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (+0.06%, p=0.386), or systolic (-0.98%, p=0.095) or diastolic (-1.06%, p=0.134) blood pressure levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, a lifestyle intervention improved health outcomes - especially <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and blood <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> - in a population at high risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that the present model is effective and feasible to carry out in primary care settings </plain></SENT>
