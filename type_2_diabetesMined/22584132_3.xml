<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the addition of liraglutide to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> followed by intensification with basal insulin (detemir) if glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (A1C) ≥7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In 988 participants from North America and Europe uncontrolled on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> ± <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> was discontinued and liraglutide 1.8 mg/day added for 12 weeks (run-in) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, those with A1C ≥7% were randomized 1:1 to 26 weeks' open-label addition of insulin detemir to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> + liraglutide (n = 162) or continuation without insulin detemir (n = 161) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients achieving A1C &lt;7% continued unchanged treatment (observational arm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was A1C change between randomized groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 821 participants completing the run-in, 61% (n = 498) achieved A1C &lt;7% (mean change -1.3% from 7.7% at start), whereas 39% (n = 323) did not (-0.6% from 8.3% at start) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During run-in, 167 of 988 (17%) withdrew; 46% of these due to gastrointestinal adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At week 26, A1C decreased further, by 0.5% (from 7.6% at randomization) with insulin detemir (n = 162) versus 0.02% increase without insulin detemir (n = 157) to 7.1 and 7.5%, respectively (estimated treatment difference -0.52 [95% CI -0.68 to -0.36]; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Forty-three percent of participants with insulin detemir versus 17% without reached A1C &lt;7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean weight decreased by 3.5 kg during run-in, then by 0.16 kg with insulin detemir or 0.95 kg without insulin detemir </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the randomized phase, no major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> occurred and minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> rates were 0.286 and 0.029 events per participant-year with and without insulin detemir (9.2 vs. 1.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Supplementation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> with liraglutide and then insulin detemir was well tolerated in the majority of patients, with good glycemic control, sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, and very low <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> rates </plain></SENT>
