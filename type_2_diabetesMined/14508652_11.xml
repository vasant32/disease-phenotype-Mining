<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We prospectively examined the effects of alcohol consumption on mortality in Type 2 diabetic patients in Switzerland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 287 patients with Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (125 women, 162 men), recruited in Switzerland for the WHO Multinational Study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Vascular Disease</z:e> in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp>, were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After a follow-up period of 12.6+/-0.6 years (means +/- SD), mortality from CHD and from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> causes was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the follow-up, 70 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred (21 from CHD, 49 from other causes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with non-drinkers, alcohol consumers who drank alcohol 1 to 15 g, 16 to 30 g and 30 g or more per day had the following risk rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from CHD: 0.87 (95% CI: 0.25 to 2.51, NS), 0.00 (95% CI: 0.00 to 0.92, p less than 0.05) and 0.37 (95% CI, 0.01 to 2.42, NS), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The corresponding risk rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> causes were 1.27 (95% CI: 0.68 to 2.28, NS), 0.36 (95% CI: 0.09 to 0.99, p less than 0.05) and 1.66 (95% CI: 0.76 to 3.33, NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In Swiss Type 2 diabetic patients moderate alcohol consumption of 16 to 30 g per day was associated with reduced mortality from CHD and from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Alcohol intake above 30 g per day was associated with a tendency towards increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality </plain></SENT>
