<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To assess this relationship, 120 urban-dwelling Malays were recruited to a cross-sectional case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixty were pre-pubertal children, 30 of diabetic parentage (Group 1) and 30 with no <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> family history (Group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Group 1 and 2 subjects were the offspring of adults with (Group 3) or without (Group 4) type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects were assessed for clinical and biochemical variables defining cardiovascular risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Principal component analysis assessed clustering of variables in the children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Group 1 subjects had a higher mean waist:hip ratio, diastolic blood pressure and HbA(1c) than those in Group 2, and a lower <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>:total cholesterol ratio (P&lt;0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although there were no correlations between Group 1 and 3 subjects for cardiovascular risk variables, significant associations were found in Groups 2 and 4, especially HbA(1c) and insulin sensitivity (P&lt; or =0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of five separate clusters of variables (factors) identified amongst the children, the strongest comprised diabetic parentage, HbA(1c), insulin sensitivity and blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Features of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> are becoming evident in the young non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> children of diabetic Malays, suggesting that lifestyle factors merit particular attention in this group </plain></SENT>
