<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The rare Ala12 variant is estimated to reduce the risk of developing Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by 20 percent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This variant is in linkage disequilibrium with another common variant, T1431 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both have opposing associations with body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We therefore examined the association of specific haplotypes marked by these two variants with susceptibility to Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We determined the PPARG genotype of a large Scottish cohort of Type 2 diabetic patients ( n=1997) and compared allele frequencies with a cohort of local children ( n=2444) and a middle-aged, population-based cohort from Scotland ( n=1061) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Frequency of the Ala12 allele was slightly lower in the Type 2 diabetic cohort than in the children [odds ratio (OR)=0.91, p=0.1] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the Ala12 variant was under-represented in the Type 2 diabetic population when compared with similarly aged non-diabetic adults (OR=0.74, p=0.0006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When the Ala12 variant was on a haplotype not bearing the 1431T variant, it conferred greater protection (OR=0.66, p=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, when it was present in haplotypes containing the 1431T variant (70% of Ala12 carriers), this protection was absent (OR=0.99, p=0.94) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We replicated the finding that the Ala12 variant of PPARgamma affords protection from Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and suggest that this protection is modulated by additional common variation at the PPARG locus </plain></SENT>
