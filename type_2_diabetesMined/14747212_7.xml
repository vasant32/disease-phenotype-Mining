<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Pharmacologic agents currently approved for use in children with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and insulin) are less than optimal for some patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the use of a ketogenic, very-low-calorie diet (VLCD) in the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a chart review of 20 children (mean age 14.5 +/- 0.4 years) who consumed a ketogenic VLCD in the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several response variables (BMI, blood pressure, HbA(1c), blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and treatment regimens) were examined before, during, and up to 2 years after the diet and compared with a matched diabetic control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Before starting the diet, 11 of 20 patients were treated with insulin and 6 with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean daily blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> values fell from 8.9 +/- 1.1 to 5.5 +/- 0.38 mmol/l (P &lt; 0.0001) in the first 3 days of the VLCD, allowing insulin and oral agents to be discontinued in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one subject </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BMI fell from 43.5 +/- 1.8 to 39.3 +/- 1.8 kg/m(2) (P &lt; 0.0001) and HbA(1c) dropped from 8.8 +/- 0.6 to 7.4 +/- 0.6% (P &lt; 0.005) as the diet was continued for a mean of 60 +/- 8 days (range 4-130 days), and none required resumption of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sustained decreases in BMI and insulin requirements were observed in patients remaining on the VLCD for at least 6 weeks when compared with those of the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The ketogenic VLCD is an effective short-term, and possibly long-term, therapy for pediatric patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control and BMI improve, allowing the discontinuation of exogenous insulin and other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This diet, although strict, has potential as an alternative to pharmacologic therapies for this emerging subset of diabetic individuals </plain></SENT>
