<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serum <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17579">beta-carotene</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22470">alpha-tocopherol</z:chebi>, lifestyle factors (BMI, physical activity and smoking) and metabolic factors (insulin sensitivity [homeostasis model assessment], <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin response and impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>) were analysed in 846 50-year-old non-diabetic Swedish men (participants in the Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> was identified in 245 participants at reinvestigations after 10, 20 and 27 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the 20 year reinvestigation, dietary intake of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17579">beta-carotene</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22470">alpha-tocopherol</z:chebi>, insulin sensitivity (euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp) and insulin secretion (early insulin response in OGTT) were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The highest tertile of serum <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17579">beta-carotene</z:chebi> at age 50 (&gt;0.335 mumol/l) was associated with 59% lower risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during follow-up compared with the lowest tertile (&lt;0.210 mumol/l) after adjustment for lifestyle and metabolic factors (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The highest tertile of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-corrected serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22470">alpha-tocopherol</z:chebi> at age 50 (&gt;3.67 mumol/mmol) was associated with 46% lower risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with the lowest tertile (&lt;3.25 mumol/mmol) independently of metabolic factors (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, lower serum <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17579">beta-carotene</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22470">alpha-tocopherol</z:chebi> concentrations were independently associated with impaired insulin sensitivity (p &lt; 0.001), but not with early insulin response, in a subsample of non-diabetic individuals 20 years later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Dietary intake of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17579">beta-carotene</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22470">alpha-tocopherol</z:chebi> independently predicted type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during 7 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Serum concentrations and dietary intakes of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17579">beta-carotene</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22470">alpha-tocopherol</z:chebi> independently predicted <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence during 27 years of follow-up in a community-based study of men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This result supports the importance of impaired <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> status for the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
