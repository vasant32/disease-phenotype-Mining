<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 1,742 female and 1,615 male youth aged 10-21 years with type 1 or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> completed a SEARCH for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> in Youth study visit during which height, weight, and A1C were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A survey assessed weight-related issues and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight-loss</z:hpo> practices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although more common in youth with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, youth with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> also reported weight-related concerns and had elevated BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among youth who had ever tried to lose weight (n = 1,646), healthy <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight-loss</z:hpo> practices (diet [76.5%] and exercise [94.8%]) were the most common, whereas unhealthy practices (fasting [8.6%], using diet <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">aids</z:e> [7.5%], <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> or <z:chebi fb="29" ids="50503">laxative</z:chebi> use [2.3%], and skipping insulin doses [4.2%]) were less common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In sex-specific multivariable models including age, race/ethnicity, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> type, BMI category, and glycemic control, <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> females and overweight/<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> males were more likely to report ever practicing any unhealthy <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight-loss</z:hpo> practice than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-weight youth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These practices were associated with poor glycemic control for female but not male subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> unhealthy <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight-loss</z:hpo> practices except fasting were more common in female than in male subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Dieting, fasting, and using diet <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">aids</z:e> were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> more common in youth with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than in those with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Given the prevalence of overweight and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> among youth with type 1 or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, health care professionals caring for youth with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> need to pay particular attention to identifying youth, particularly females, with unhealthy <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight-loss</z:hpo> practices </plain></SENT>
