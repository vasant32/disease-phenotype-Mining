<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of pramlintide in this patient population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a 52-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study, 656 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (age 57 +/- 10 years, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration 12 +/- 7 years, BMI 34.0 +/- 7.0 kg/m(2), HbA(1c) 9.1 +/- 1.2%, mean +/- SD) treated with insulin (alone or in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> and/or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>) were randomized to receive additional preprandial subcutaneous injections of either placebo or pramlintide (60 micro g TID, 90 microg BID, or 120 microg BID) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treatment with pramlintide 120 micro g BID led to a sustained reduction from baseline in HbA(1c) (-0.68 and -0.62% at weeks 26 and 52, respectively), which was significantly greater than that seen with placebo (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proportion of patients achieving an HbA(1c) &lt;8% was approximately twofold greater with pramlintide (120 microg BID) than with placebo (46 vs. 28%, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The glycemic improvement with pramlintide 120 micro g BID was accompanied by a mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> (-1.4 kg vs. +0.7 kg with placebo at week 52, P &lt; 0.05) and occurred without an overall increase in the severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> event rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most common adverse event associated with pramlintide use was transient, mild-to-moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Mealtime amylin replacement with pramlintide 120 microg BID, as an adjunct to insulin therapy, improves long-term glycemic and weight control in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
