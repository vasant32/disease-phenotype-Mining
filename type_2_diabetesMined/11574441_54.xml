<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 279 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011882" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic neuropathy</z:e> were treated with placebo or fidarestat at a daily dose of 1 mg for 52 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The efficacy evaluation was based on change in electrophysiological measurements of median and tibial motor nerve conduction velocity, F-wave minimum latency, F-wave conduction velocity (FCV), and median sensory nerve conduction velocity (forearm and distal), as well as an assessment of subjective symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over the course of the study, five of the eight electrophysiological measures assessed showed significant improvement from baseline in the fidarestat-treated group, whereas no measure showed significant deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in the placebo group, no electrophysiological measure was improved, and one measure significantly deteriorated (i.e., median nerve FCV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the study conclusion, the fidarestat-treated group was significantly improved compared with the placebo group in two electrophysiological measures (i.e., median nerve FCV and minimal latency) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subjective symptoms (including numbness, spontaneous pain, sensation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002063'>rigidity</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003401'>paresthesia</z:hpo> in the sole upon walking, heaviness in the foot, and hypesthesia) benefited from fidarestat treatment, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were significantly improved in the treated versus placebo group at the study conclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the dose used, fidarestat was well tolerated, with an adverse event profile that did not significantly differ from that seen in the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The effects of fidarestat-treatment on nerve conduction and the subjective symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011882" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic neuropathy</z:e> provide evidence that this treatment alters the progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011882" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic neuropathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
