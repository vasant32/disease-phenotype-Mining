<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four thousand eight hundred and seven admissions in the period 1996-2002 and 137 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in the period 1996-2000 with a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001953'>diabetic ketoacidosis</z:hpo> were identified from the Danish National Patient Registry and Danish Cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> Registry, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Annual incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001953'>diabetic ketoacidosis</z:hpo> in the general population was estimated to 12.9 per 100,000, being higher in males than in females (14.4 versus 11.4 per 100,000, p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twelve percent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were classified as Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, predominantly in patients &gt;50 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall mortality was 4%, being higher in patients &gt;70 years than in patients &lt; or =70 years (15% versus 2%, p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One or more additional somatic diagnoses were stated on 77% of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> certificates, most often a diagnosis of cardiovascular (47%) or infectious (30%) diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared to previous studies, the incidence in the general population seems to have remained unaltered the past 25 years, but may have decreased in younger patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Older patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001953'>diabetic ketoacidosis</z:hpo> differed from younger patients in having a higher mortality and a larger proportion of patients classified as Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
