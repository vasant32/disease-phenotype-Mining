<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, BMI &gt; or =27 kg/m2, A1C &gt;6.5 and &lt;11.0%, treated with diet and exercise alone or in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomized to placebo or topiramate CR titrated up to 175 mg/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment consisted of a 7-week titration phase followed by a 9-week maintenance phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 111 subjects were randomized and analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By the end of week 16, patients in the placebo and topiramate groups lost 2.5 and 6.0 kg, which represented 2.3 and 5.8%, respectively, of their baseline body weight (P &lt; 0.001 vs. placebo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A1C improved from a baseline of 7.4% in the placebo and 7.6% in the topiramate groups to 7.1 and 6.7%, respectively, representing a 0.4 and 0.9% reduction from baseline, respectively (P &lt; 0.001 vs. placebo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Topiramate also significantly <z:mp ids='MP_0002843'>reduced blood pressure</z:mp> and urinary albumin excretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adverse events were predominantly neuropsychiatric or central and peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Topiramate CR treatment produced significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and meaningful improvements in A1C and blood pressure in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treated with diet and exercise or in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system and psychiatric adverse event profile of topiramate CR makes it unsuitable for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
