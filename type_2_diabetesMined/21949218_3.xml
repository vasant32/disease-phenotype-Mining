<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A risk score for NODAT could help identify research subjects for intervention studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a single-center retrospective cohort study using pretransplant clinical and laboratory measurements to construct a risk score for NODAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NODAT was defined by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c) (HbA(1c)) ≥6.5%, fasting serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> ≥126 mg/dL, or prescribed therapy for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> within 1 year posttransplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three multivariate logistic regression models were constructed: 1) standard model, with both continuous and discrete variables; 2) dichotomous model, with continuous variables dichotomized at clinically relevant cut points; and 3) summary score defined as the sum of the points accrued using the terms from the dichotomous model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 316 subjects had seven pretransplant variables with P &lt; 0.10 in univariate logistic regression analyses (age, planned <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> therapy posttransplant, prescription for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001997'>gout</z:hpo> medicine, BMI, fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, and family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) that were selected for multivariate models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Areas under receiver operating curves for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three models were similar (0.72, 0.71, and 0.70) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A simple risk score calculated as the sum of points from the seven variables performed as well as the other two models in identifying risk of NODAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A risk score computed from seven simple pretransplant variables can identify risk of NODAT </plain></SENT>
