<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe a 15-year follow-up of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and to present data regarding pancreatic beta-cell function in two adolescents affected by the <z:hpo ids='HP_0004860'>thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anemia</z:hpo> (TRMA) syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORTS: The first patient (PMR) is a 17.5-year-old Italian girl who presented <z:hpo ids='HP_0001889'>megaloblastic anemia</z:hpo> at 7.5 months of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At age 2.5 years, because of the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000407'>sensorineural deafness</z:hpo>, she was diagnosed with TRMA syndrome and started treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49105">thiamine-HCl</z:chebi>, followed very early by benzoyloxymethyl-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="26948,33283">thiamine</z:chebi> (BOM-T) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The second patient (PF) is a 16.8-year-old Italian boy born to consanguineous parents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000407'>Sensorineural deafness</z:hpo> was diagnosed at age 1.5 years, while <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001993'>ketoacidosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001889'>megaloblastic anemia</z:hpo> were diagnosed at age 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49105">thiamine HCl</z:chebi> was started immediately after diagnosis and changed to BOM-T 2 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subsequent to the initiation of the vitamin, the two patients did not require insulin for approximately 7 and 10 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Puberty was determinant in deteriorating the metabolic control in these patients, leading to treatment with an oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agent</z:chebi> and finally to a reinstitution of insulin therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The hormonal assessment in our patients (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> insulin response to oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in childhood, preserved C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> secretion in case 2) and the good response to an oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agent</z:chebi> would indicate that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030286" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pancreatic disease</z:e> may initiate as type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and may progress after several years to an insulin-requiring <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, as indicated by the exhaustion of the insulin secretory capacity </plain></SENT>
