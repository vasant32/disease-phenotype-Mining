<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that interaction between PPARG2 Pro12Ala and variants in the promoter region of HNF4A are associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related quantitative traits in Mexican-American families of a proband with previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The BetaGene project genotyped PPARG2 Pro12Ala and nine HNF4A single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 473 individuals in 89 families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Members of the proband generation had fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &lt;126 mg/dl and were phenotyped by oral and intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Neither PPARG2 Pro12Ala nor any of the nine HNF4A SNPs were independently associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related quantitative traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the interaction between PPARG2 Pro12Ala and HNF4A rs2144908 was significantly associated with both insulin sensitivity (S(I)) (Bonferroni P = 0.0006) and 2-h insulin (Bonferroni P = 0.039) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subjects with at least one PPARG2 Ala allele and homozygous for the HNF4A rs2144908 A allele had 40% higher S(I) compared with individuals with at least one G allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>S(I) did not vary by rs2144908 genotype among PPARG2 Pro/Pro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The interaction result for S(I) was replicated by the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin Resistance</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Family Study (P = 0.018) in their San Antonio sample (n = 484) where subjects with at least one PPARG2 Ala allele and homozygous for the HNF4A rs2144908 A allele had a 29% higher S(I) compared with individuals with at least one G allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the interaction was not replicated in their San Luis Valley sample (n = 496; P = 0.401) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Together, these results suggest that variation in PPARG2 and HNF4A may interact to regulate insulin sensitivity in Mexican Americans at risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
