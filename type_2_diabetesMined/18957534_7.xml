<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Overweight/<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> participants with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 124, age = 56.5 +/- 0.8 years, BMI = 35.9 +/- 0.3 kg/m2, and A1C = 7.3 +/- 0.1%) were randomly assigned to 1 year of a high-MUFA or high-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi> diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anthropometric and metabolic parameters were assessed at baseline and after 4, 8, and 12 months of dieting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were similar between the treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall retention rate for 1 year was 77% (69% for the high-MUFA group and 84% for the high-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi> group; P = 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on food records, both groups had similar energy intake but a significant difference in MUFA intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both groups had similar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> over 1 year (-4.0 +/- 0.8 vs. -3.8 +/- 0.6 kg) and comparable improvement in body fat, waist circumference, diastolic blood pressure, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, A1C, and fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in these parameters between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A follow-up assessment of a subset of participants (n = 36) was conducted 18 months after completion of the 52-week diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These participants maintained their <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and A1C during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, high-MUFA diets are an alternative to conventional lower-fat, high-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi> diets with comparable beneficial effects on body weight, body composition, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, and glycemic control </plain></SENT>
