<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data on the dietary effects on these diets' <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism have been previously published </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study compared the effect of feeding 42 type 2 diabetic patients a carefully controlled isoenergic high-carbohydrate (high-carb; 55% energy as carbohydrate, 30% as fat, and 10% as monounsaturated fat) and high-monounsaturated fat (high-mono; 45% energy as fat, 25% as monounsaturated fat, and 40% as carbohydrate) diet for 6 weeks each in a four-center, randomized, cross-over study on blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients continued the diet they received during the second phase for an additional 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: According to repeated-measures ANOVA, blood pressure during the last 3 days of each phase was similar after 6 weeks of the high-carb and high-mono diets (systolic blood pressure: 128 +/- 16 vs. 127 +/- 15 mmHg, P = 0.9; diastolic blood pressure: 75 +/- 7 vs. 75 +/- 8 mmHg, P = 0.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, after 14 weeks of the high-carb diet (n = 13), there was a significant increase in blood pressure compared with 6 weeks of the high-mono diet (systolic blood pressure: 132 +/- 13 vs. 126 +/- 11 mmHg, P = 0.04; diastolic blood pressure: 83 +/- 6 vs. 76 +/- 7 mmHg, P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 14 weeks of the high-mono diet (n = 8), the reduction in blood pressure was not significant compared with 6 weeks of the high-carb diet (systolic blood pressure: 118 +/- 14 vs. 121 +/- 16 mmHg, P = 0.4; diastolic blood pressure: 71 +/- 8 vs. 75 +/- 10 mmHg, P = 0.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although the exchange of carbohydrates with monounsaturated fats may not affect blood pressure in the short term, long-term consumption of a high-carbohydrate diet may modestly raise blood pressure in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
