<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study used a cross-sectional design with face-to-face or telephone interviews of diabetic patients and healthcare providers in 13 countries from Asia, Australia, Europe and North America </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants were randomly selected adults with type 1 or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n=5,104), and randomly selected <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-care providers, including primary-care physicians (n=2,070), <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> specialist physicians (n=635) and nurses (n=1,122) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis was used to examine the relationships between outcomes and both country and respondent characteristics, and the interaction between these two factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Providers rated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>-care systems and remuneration for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> care as mediocre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients reported that ease of access to care was high, but not without financial barriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients reported moderate levels of collaboration among providers, and providers indicated that several specialist disciplines were not readily available to them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients reported high levels of collaboration with providers in their own care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Provider endorsement of primary prevention strategies for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with fewer socio-economic resources and more <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> complications had lower access (and/or higher barriers) to care and lower quality of patient-provider collaboration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Countries differed significantly for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> outcomes, and the relationships between respondent characteristics and outcomes varied by country </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: There is much need for improvement in applying the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>-care model to the treatment and prevention of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the countries studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Each country must develop its own priorities for improving <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care and comparison with other countries can help identify strengths as well as weaknesses </plain></SENT>
