<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the long-term risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> following a pregnancy complicated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> mellitus (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e>) and assess what maternal antepartum, postpartum, and neonatal factors are predictive of later development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study using survival analysis on 5,470 GDM patients and 783 control subjects who presented for postnatal follow-up at the Mercy Hospital for Women between 1971 and 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Risk of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> increased with time of follow-up for both groups and was 9.6 times greater for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cumulative risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> patients was 25.8% at 15 years postdiagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Predictive factors for the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were use of insulin (hazard ratio 3.5), Asian origin compared with Caucasian (2.1), and 1-h blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (1.3 for every 1 mmol increase above 10.1 mmol) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BMI was associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> but did not meet the assumption of proportional hazards required for valid inference when using Cox proportional hazards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: While specific predictive factors for the later development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> can be identified in the index pregnancy, women with a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e>, as a group, are worthy of long-term follow-up to ameliorate their excess cardiovascular risk </plain></SENT>
