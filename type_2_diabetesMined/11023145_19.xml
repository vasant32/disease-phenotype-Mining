<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This research involved secondary analysis of a mailed survey completed by 296 adults (ages 20-90 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Structural equation modeling was conducted to investigate relationships among cognitive representations, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-specific health behaviors, and quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Model differences by <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> type were also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Findings indicated that certain cognitive representation constructs were related to increased <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-specific health behaviors, decreased sense of burden, and positive quality-of-life outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Individuals levels of understanding of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and their perceptions of control over <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were the most significant predictors of outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-specific health behaviors were related to an increased sense of burden that was negatively associated with quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Multigroup analyses indicated that this self-regulatory model provided a good fit for individuals with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, those with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who take insulin, and those with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who do not take insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings advance what is known about cognitive representations of illness and the self-regulation of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> as well as the relationships between cognitive representations of illness, quality of life, and behavioral factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In particular, results from this study suggest the need for further study to address ways of reducing the burden of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> associated with health behaviors and decreased quality of life </plain></SENT>
