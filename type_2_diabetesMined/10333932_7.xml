<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical effects of a comprehensive prepackaged meal plan, incorporating the overall dietary guidelines of the American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association and other national health organizations, relative to those of a self-selected diet based on exchange lists in free-living individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 202 women and men (BMI &lt; or = 42 kg/m2) whose <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was treated with diet alone or an oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agent</z:chebi> were enrolled at 10 medical centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After a 4-week baseline period, participants were randomized to a nutrient-fortified prepared meal plan or a self-selected exchange-list diet for 10 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On a caloric basis, both interventions were designed to provide 55-60% carbohydrate, 20-30% fat, and 15-20% protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At intervals, 3-day food records were completed, and body weight, glycemic control, plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, and blood pressure were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Food records showed that multiple nutritional improvements were achieved with both diet plans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were significant overall reductions in body weight and BMI, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and serum insulin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24103">fructosamine</z:chebi>, HbA1c, total and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, and blood pressure (P &lt; 0.001 or better for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In general, differences in major end points between the diet plans were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Glycemic control and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> improve in individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who consume diets in accordance with the American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The prepared meal program was as clinically effective as the exchange-list diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The prepared meal plan has the additional advantages of being easily prescribed and eliminating the complexities of meeting the multiple dietary recommendations for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> management </plain></SENT>
