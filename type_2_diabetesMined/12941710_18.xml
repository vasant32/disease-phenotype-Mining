<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Overweight or <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treated with diet or oral medication were randomly assigned to either a standard therapy or combination therapy group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both groups received a standardized program to facilitate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The combination therapy group also received 10-15 mg sibutramine daily, low-calorie diets using meal replacement products for 1 week every 2 months, and between low-calorie diet weeks, once daily use of meal replacement product and snack bars to replace one usual meal and snack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Primary outcome measures were changes in body weight, glycemic control, plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, blood pressure, pulse, and body composition at 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At 1 year, combination therapy, compared with standard therapy, resulted in significantly more <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> (-7.3 +/- 1.3 kg vs. -0.8 +/- 0.9 kg, P &lt; 0.001) and reduction in HbA(1c) (-0.6 +/- 0.3 vs. 0.0 +/- 0.2%, P = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Combination therapy resulted in reduced requirement for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> medications and decreased fat mass and lean body mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A 5-kg decrease in weight at 1 year was associated with a decrease of 0.4% in HbA(1c) (P = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Changes in fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, pulse, and blood pressure did not differ between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This combination <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> program resulted in greater <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and improved <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> control compared with a standard <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> program in overweight or <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
