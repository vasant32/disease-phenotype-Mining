<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the clustering of eight <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> (smoking, high body mass index, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004421'>elevated systolic blood pressure</z:hpo>, high serum, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>) cholesterol, high serum <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, low serum, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>) cholesterol, high fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and high plasma insulin concentration) and their effect on the prognosis and the tracking effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study is a population-based prospective follow-up of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic subjects (n = 133, aged 45-64 years) in Eastern Finland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The following end points were used: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and incidences of first <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and first <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we studied the 'tracking effect' of the risk factor clusters during the 10-year follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: When the clustering of risk factors typical of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> was taken into account, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality increased from 28.6% to 50.0% (p &lt; 0.05) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> mortality increased from 14.3% to 50.0% (p &lt; 0.01) depending on the number of risk factors present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of first <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> increased from 0% to 40.0% (p &lt; 0.05) as the number of risk factors increased from 0 to 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In survivors, the proportion of individuals with no risk factors decreased and the proportion on individuals with three to four risk factors increased during the 10-year follow-up period despite the high mortality among the group with many risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The risk factor clusters among type 2 diabetic subjects are of great predictive value and when not aggressively treated, show a relentless increase despite selective mortality </plain></SENT>
