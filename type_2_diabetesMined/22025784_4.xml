<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Incretin hormones increase bone density in experimental models, but the effect of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors on bone fractures has not been reported so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A meta-analysis was performed including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> randomized clinical trials with a duration of at least 24 weeks, enrolling patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, comparing DPP-4 inhibitors with placebo or active drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-eight trials enrolling 11,880 and 9,175 patients for DPP-4 inhibitors and comparators, respectively, were included, reporting 63 fractures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DPP-4 inhibitors, compared with placebo or other treatments, were associated with a reduced risk of fractures (Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio [MH-OR] 0.60, 95% CI 0.37-0.99, P = 0.045), even after the exclusion of comparisons with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> (MH-OR 0.56, 0.33-0.93, P = 0.026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present meta-analysis suggests that treatment with DPP-4 inhibitors could be associated with a reduced risk of bone fractures </plain></SENT>
