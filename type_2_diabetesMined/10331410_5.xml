<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four patients were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi>, and the remaining seven with diet therapy alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>None had diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level was 117+/-7 mg/dl (mean +/- SE), and HbA1c was 6.6+/-0.3% </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma insulin response to the stimuli and insulin sensitivity indexes (S(I), S(I)*, and S(I)2* were derived from a minimal model and single- and two-compartment-labeled minimal models) were impaired in the type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The combined ability of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, per se, to increase its own uptake and suppress EGP (<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> effectiveness [SG]), which was derived from kinetic analysis of plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> by a minimal model, was significantly lower in the type 2 diabetic patients (0.0132+/-0.0015 vs. 0.0203+/-0.0022; P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the ability of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, per se, to stimulate <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake, assessed as S(G)* and S(G)2* from the kinetic analysis of labeled <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> by single- and two-compartment minimal model, was not impaired in those patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>EGP of the type 2 diabetic patients as a whole was suppressed to the level similar to that of the control subjects despite a higher plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level throughout FSIGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When EGP in the diabetic subjects was analyzed, considering their recent glycemic control, the initial suppression was blunted in the patients with higher HbA1c levels </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This blunted suppression of EGP might be one of the conspirators for decreased S(G) in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
