<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The incretin effect denominates the phenomenon that oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> elicits a higher insulin response than does intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The two hormones responsible for the incretin effect, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent insulinotropic hormone (GIP) and glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1), are secreted after oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> loads and augment insulin secretion in response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the incretin effect is reduced, and there is a moderate degree of GLP-1 hyposecretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the insulinotropic response to GLP-1 is well maintained in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>GIP is secreted normally or hypersecreted in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; however, the responsiveness of the <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> pancreas to GIP is greatly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In approximately 50% of first-degree relatives of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, similarly reduced insulinotropic responses toward exogenous GIP can be observed, without significantly changed secretion of GIP or GLP-1 after oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This opens the possibility that a reduced responsiveness to GIP is an early step in the pathogenesis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, this provides a basis to use incretin hormones, especially GLP-1 and its derivatives, to replace a deficiency in incretin-mediated insulin secretion in the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
