<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Studies in vitro have shown that glycosylation of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>) will decrease its ability to bind to its receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have evaluated the possibility that such an event might occur in vivo in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by comparing the binding and degradation by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fibroblasts and mouse peritoneal macrophages of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> obtained from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects and patients with Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When compared with control subjects, Type 2 diabetic patients had elevated fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (increased by 160%), <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> AIc (increased by 75%), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> (increased by 550%), and cholesterol (increased by 48%) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> from Type 2 diabetic patients displayed populations of particles with more <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> hydrated densities than <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> from control subjects, with enrichment in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> content of the lighter population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>125I-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and Type 2 diabetic subjects bound to fibroblasts with similar binding affinities and binding capacities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The kinetics of degradation of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and Type 2 diabetic subjects by fibroblasts were also similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> populations of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> particles from Type 2 diabetic patients were bound and degraded by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fibroblasts in identical fashions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, 125I-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and Type 2 diabetic subjects were not bound or degraded by mouse peritoneal macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> of patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with moderate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> are not modified sufficiently to alter their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> binding and degradation by human fibroblasts or to cause their uptake by mouse peritoneal macrophages </plain></SENT>
