<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Basal plasma and erythrocyte <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> levels were significantly lower in diabetic patients than in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In vitro incubation in the presence of 100 mU/l insulin significantly increased <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> erythrocyte levels in both control subjects (p less than 0.001) and patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, even in the presence of 100 mU/l insulin, the erythrocyte <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> content of patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was lower than that of control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The in vitro dose-response curve of the effect of insulin on <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> erythrocyte accumulation was shifted to the right when red cells of diabetic patients were used, with a highly significant reduction of the maximal effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Such reduction of the maximal effect of insulin suggests that the impairment of insulin-induced erythrocyte <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> accumulation observed in Type 2 diabetic patients results essentially from a post-receptor defect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
