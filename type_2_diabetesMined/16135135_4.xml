<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The attainment and maintenance of good glycaemic control in both type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are major challenges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The main (perceived) barriers of therapy are poor compliance with prescribed medication, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e>, fear of insulin injection and fear of self-testing by finger pricking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Another major issue is the acceptance and uptake of new insulin-delivery systems and routes of administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Insulin therapy regimens and insulin preparations are nowadays often chosen because of the ease of delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The use of inhaled insulin may, because of the relative ease of administration, facilitate the transfer of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients from tablets to insulin, especially in patients with fear or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0349231" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">phobia</z:e> of needles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, non-injectable insulin will not automatically be preferred to subcutaneous (SC) insulin injections and a proper assessment of patient acceptance and preference is of great importance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recent studies suggest that patients may prefer inhaled insulin (Exubera) over SC insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, the availability of inhaled insulin as a potential treatment may increase a patient's willingness to add or change to more appropriate <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> therapy, which includes insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Future studies should be targeted at specific groups of patients who may benefit the most from inhaled insulin, such as those with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who are delaying initiation or intensification of insulin injections </plain></SENT>
