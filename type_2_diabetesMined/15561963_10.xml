<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Genome-wide scans in multiple populations have identified chromosome 1q21-q24 as one susceptibility region for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To map the susceptibility genes, we first placed a dense single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) map across the linked region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We identified two SNPs that showed strong associations, and both mapped to within intron 2 of the calsequestrin 1 (CASQ1) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that sequence variation in or near CASQ1 contributed to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility in Northern European Caucasians by identifying additional SNPs from the public database and by screening the CASQ1 gene for additional variation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition to 15 known SNPs in this region, we found 8 new SNPs, 3 of which were in exons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A single rare nonsynonymous SNP in exon 11 (A348V) was not associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The associated SNPs were localized to the region between -1,404 in the 5' flanking region and 2,949 in intron 2 (P = 0.002 to P = 0.034) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No SNP 3' to intron 2, including the adjacent gene PEA15, showed an association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The strongest associations were restricted to individuals of Northern European ancestry ascertained in Utah </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A six-marker haplotype was also associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P = 0.008), but neither transmission disequilibrium test nor family-based association studies were significant for the most strongly associated SNP in intron 2 (SNP CASQ2312) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An independent association of SNPs in introns 2 and 4 with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is reported in Amish families with linkage to chromosome 1q21-q24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that noncoding SNPs in CASQ1 alter <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility, either by a direct effect on CASQ1 gene expression or perhaps by regulating a nearby gene such as PEA15 </plain></SENT>
