<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Primary end point was change from baseline in A1C at 52 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Secondary end points included change in fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) and systolic blood pressure (BP), and percent change in body weight, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Safety was assessed based on adverse event (AE) reports.RESULTSAt 52 weeks, canagliflozin 300 mg demonstrated noninferiority and, in a subsequent assessment, showed superiority to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> 100 mg in reducing A1C (-1.03% [-11.3 mmol/mol] and -0.66% [-7.2 mmol/mol], respectively; least squares mean difference between groups, -0.37% [95% CI, -0.50 to -0.25] or -4.0 mmol/mol [-5.5 to -2.7]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Greater reductions in FPG, body weight, and systolic BP were observed with canagliflozin versus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall AE rates were similar with canagliflozin (76.7%) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> (77.5%); incidence of serious AEs and AE-related discontinuations was low for both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Higher incidences of genital mycotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> and osmotic <z:mp ids='MP_0001762'>diuresis</z:mp>-related AEs were observed with canagliflozin, which led to one discontinuation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>Hypoglycemia</z:hpo> rates were similar in both groups.CONCLUSIONFindings suggest that canagliflozin may be a new therapeutic tool providing better improvement in glycemic control and body weight reduction than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi>, but with increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0729552" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genital infections</z:e> in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
