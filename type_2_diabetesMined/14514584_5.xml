<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective, case-cohort study was conducted among 6017 women aged 45-80 years with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from 1 January 1986 to 31 December 1992 at the Group Health Cooperative in Washington state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular outcomes, including nonfatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (n = 215), coronary revascularization (n = 253), and cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (n = 229), were ascertained through 31 December 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50745">progestin</z:chebi> was derived from automated pharmacy records and modeled as a time-dependent variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 6.8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariable-adjusted relative risk (RR) and 95% CI were calculated using Cox proportional hazard models for case-cohort analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Current use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> with (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.22-0.85) or without (0.48, 0.30-0.78) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50745">progestin</z:chebi> was associated with a decreased risk of cardiovascular events compared with never having used <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Risk of cardiovascular events associated with a first episode of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> use (with or without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50745">progestin</z:chebi>) of &lt;25 months' duration (1.12, 0.49-2.54), first episode of use &gt;or=25 months' duration (0.32, 0.06-1.70), and current use that was not the first episode of use (0.42, 0.42-0.67) indicated that recent initiation was not associated with an increase or decrease in risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results show an association of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> therapy, with or without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50745">progestin</z:chebi>, with decreased risk of cardiovascular events among women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This association should be further investigated in large randomized, controlled trials </plain></SENT>
