<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known about how hormone replacement therapy (HRT) affects <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to examine whether HbA(1c) levels varied by current HRT among women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a cohort of 15,435 women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were members of a health maintenance organization, HbA(1c) and HRT were assessed by reviewing records in the health plan's computerized laboratory and pharmacy systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sociodemographic and clinical information were collected by survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age was 64.7 years (SD +/- 8.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The study cohort comprised 55% non-Hispanic whites, 14% non-Hispanic blacks, 12% Hispanics, 11% Asians, 4% "other" ethnic groups, and 4% with missing ethnicity data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Current HRT was observed in 25% of women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HbA(1c) levels were significantly lower in women currently using HRT than in women not using HRT (age-adjusted mean +/- SE: 7.9 +/- 0.03 vs. 8.5 +/- 0.02, respectively, P = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No differences in HbA(1c) level were observed between women using unopposed <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50114">estrogens</z:chebi> and women using opposed <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50114">estrogens</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In a Generalized Estimating Equation model, which took into account patient clustering within physician and adjusted for age, ethnicity, education, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, hypoglycemic therapy, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration, self-monitoring of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and exercise, HRT remained significantly and independently associated with decreased HbA(1c) levels (P = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: HRT was independently associated with decreased HbA(1c) level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Clinical trials will be necessary to understand whether HRT may improve glycemic control in women with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
