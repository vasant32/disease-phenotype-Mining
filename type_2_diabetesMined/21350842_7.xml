<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite the high prevalence of the disease in South Asians, studies investigating GWA-validated type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk variants in this ethnic group are limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated 30 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), predominantly derived from recent GWA studies, to determine if and to what extent these variants affect type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk in two Punjabi populations, originating predominantly from the District of Mirpur, Pakistan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty SNPs were genotyped in 1,678 participants with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 1,584 normoglycaemic control participants from two populations; one resident in the UK and one indigenous to the District of Mirpur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SNPs in or near PPARG, TCF7L2, FTO, CDKN2A/2B, HHEX/IDE, IGF2BP2, SLC30A8, KCNQ1, JAZF1, IRS1, KLF14, CHCHD9 and DUSP9 displayed significant (p &lt; 0.05) associations with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, with similar effect sizes to those seen in European populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A constructed genetic risk score was associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (p = 5.46 × 10(-12)), BMI (p = 2.25 × 10(-4)) and age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We have demonstrated that 13 variants confer an increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in our Pakistani populations; to our knowledge this is the first time that SNPs in or near KCNQ1, JAZF1, IRS1, KLF14, CHCHD9 and DUSP9 have been significantly associated with the disease in South Asians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Large-scale studies and meta-analyses of South Asian populations are needed to further confirm the effect of these variants in this ethnic group </plain></SENT>
