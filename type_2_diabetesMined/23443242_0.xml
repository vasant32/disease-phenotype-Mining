<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eligible patients (1,702) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (mean age, 58.5 years; 47% women) from 59 institutes were followed for a median of 8.05 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A comprehensive lifestyle survey including LTPA and occupation was performed using standardised questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Outcome was occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> (CHD), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and total mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The adjusted HR and 95% CI were calculated by Cox regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significant reduction in HR in patients in the top (≥15.4 metabolic equivalents [MET] h/week) vs the bottom tertile (≤3.7 MET h/week) of LTPA, adjusted by age, sex and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration, was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.32, 0.94) and total mortality (HR 0.49, 95% CI 0.26, 0.91) but not in CHD (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.48, 1.25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The HR for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> became borderline significant or nonsignificant after adjustment for lifestyle or clinical variables including diet or serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The significantly reduced total mortality by LTPA was independent of these variables and seemed not to be, at least mainly, attributed to reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In Japanese persons with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, LTPA of 15.4 MET h/week or more was associated with a significantly lower risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> partly through ameliorating combinations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It was also associated with significantly reduced total mortality but independently of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> or events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings, implying differences from Western diabetic populations, should be considered in the clinical management of East Asians with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
