<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we attempted a replication of these associations in a large population-based cohort of female twins comprehensively phenotyped for measures of general and central <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two TUB SNPs (rs2272382, rs2272383) and a third (rs1528133), 22 kb distal to RIC3, were genotyped in 2694 Europid women from the St Thomas' UK Adult Twin Registry (Twins UK) (mean age +/- SD: 47.6 +/- 12.7 years; 42.8% postmenopausal) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We explored the hypothesis that TUB is a candidate gene for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in humans through testing the interaction of the SNPs by menopausal status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the whole cohort, none of the three SNPs showed a significant main effect on measures of general or central <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, for central <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> the rs2272382 SNP showed a significant interaction with menopausal status (p = 0.036) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Postmenopausal women homozygous for the minor allele of rs2272382 showed significantly more general <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (p = 0.022) and central <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (p = 0.009) than carriers of the major allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Differences (beta [95% CI]) between the two genotype groups were 0.92 kg/m2 (0.03-1.81) for BMI (p = 0.036), 2.73 cm (0.62-4.84) for waist circumference (p = 0.013) and 2.43% (0.27-4.60) for per cent central fat (p = 0.027) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These associations were confirmed by a sibling transmission disequilibrium test for central <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, waist circumference and per cent central fat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We have replicated associations of TUB SNP rs2272382 with measures of general and central <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> postmenopausal women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings confirm TUB as a candidate gene for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in humans </plain></SENT>
