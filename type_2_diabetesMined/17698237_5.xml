<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 257 Japanese subjects (169 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 88 non-diabetic subjects) were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To assess the hepatic fat content, the ratio of the CT attenuation value of the liver to that of the spleen (L/S ratio) was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum GGT was significantly correlated with the waist circumference, BMI, visceral fat area (VFA), L/S ratio and TG, but not with the subcutaneous fat area (SFA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The serum GGT was still correlated with the VFA and TG, but not with the SFA, after adjustment for the four variables of age, gender, serum HbA1c and the L/S ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our finding that the serum GGT is specifically associated with the VFA, but not with the SFA, suggests that the serum GGT may be useful as a convenient indicator of VFA in the clinical treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
