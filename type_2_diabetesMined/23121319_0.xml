<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was performed to emphasize the meaning of caloric analysis of urine and faeces for energy balance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We measured energetic loss via urine and faeces during antihyperglycaemic treatment in male <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats were treated for 10 days with the <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-linked transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor AVE2268, with insulin glargine, with the GLP-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> lixisenatide and with the combination of insulin glargine and lixisenatide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each study was accompanied by one lean (Fa/?) and one <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (fa/fa) untreated non-diabetic and diabetic control group, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, body weight alterations and food assimilation efficiency were monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In control ZDF rats, more than 12 g/day of pure <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was urinarily excreted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In total, the energetic loss via urine exceeded 30% from total energy uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Insulin glargine treatment decreased urinary energetic loss, leading to a body <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> of approximately 3 g/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An almost body weight-neutral antihyperglycaemic treatment could be achieved with AVE2268 and lixisenatide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>While lixisenatide <z:mp ids='MP_0008489'>reduced body weight gain</z:mp> via reduction of energy uptake, the SGLT2 inhibitor even increased urinary <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and thus energy excretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Combining insulin glargine with lixisenatide attenuated the anabolic effect of insulin resulting in weight neutrality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data clearly show renal contribution to the body's energy control by urinary <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excretion (UGE) during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The undesired retained energy could be reduced via additional UGE or via simultaneous reduction of energy uptake and/or energy retention </plain></SENT>
