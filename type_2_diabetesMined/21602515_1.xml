<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Adipocyte infiltration of the musculoskeletal system is well recognized as a hallmark of aging, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intermuscular adipocytes might serve as a benign storage site for surplus <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> or play a role in disrupting energy homeostasis as a result of dysregulated lipolysis or secretion of proinflammatory cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This investigation sought to understand the net impact of local adipocytes on skeletal myocyte metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Interactions between these two tissues were modeled using a coculture system composed of primary human adipocytes and human skeletal myotubes derived from lean or <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Metabolic analysis of myocytes was performed after coculture with lipolytically silent or activated adipocytes and included transcript and metabolite profiling along with assessment of substrate selection and insulin action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cocultured adipocytes increased myotube <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of genes involved in oxidative metabolism, regardless of the donor and degree of lipolytic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adipocytes in the basal state sequestered free fatty acids, thereby forcing neighboring myotubes to rely more heavily on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> fuel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Under this condition, insulin action was enhanced in myotubes from lean but not <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, when exposed to lipolytically active adipocytes, cocultured myotubes shifted substrate use in favor of fatty acids, which was accompanied by intracellular accumulation of triacylglycerol and even-chain acylcarnitines, decreased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> oxidation, and modest attenuation of insulin signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The effects of cocultured adipocytes on myocyte substrate selection and insulin action depended on the metabolic state of the system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings are relevant to understanding the metabolic consequences of intermuscular adipogenesis </plain></SENT>
