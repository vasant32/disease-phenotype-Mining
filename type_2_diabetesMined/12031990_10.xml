<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The genotype frequencies for II, ID, and DD were 39.8, 39.8, and 20.3%, respectively, in the case group and 44.8, 44.8, and 10.4% in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The DD frequency was significantly higher in the case group than in the control group (chi(2)(1) = 4.77, P = 0.03), suggesting that the DD genotype is associated with an increased susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in our study population </plain></SENT>
