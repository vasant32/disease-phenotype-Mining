<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the relationship between serum RBP4 levels and IR in Chinese subjects with type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fasting serum RBP4 levels in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2DM) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (NGT) were measured by enzyme-linked immune assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity was assessed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> index (HOMA-IR), the anthropometrical parameters such as body mass index (BMI), waist hip ratio (WHR) were evaluated and fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FBG), HBA1C, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and fasting insulin levels were also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum RBP4 levels were found to correlate positively with HOMA-IR (r=0.257, P=0.024) in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A correlation analysis showed that serum RBP4 levels also correlate with sex, BMI, WHR, TG and FINS, respectively (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A stepwise linear multiple regression model revealed that BMI and sex were significant determinants of RBP4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is a positive relationship between RBP4 and IR in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RBP4 may play a role in pathogenesis of T2DM </plain></SENT>
