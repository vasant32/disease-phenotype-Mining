<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An anonymous survey was distributed among medical students, resident medical officers (RMOs) and general practitioners (GPs) presenting a hypothetical case of a 58 year old patient with sub-optimally controlled <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on metfomin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants were then asked for their next step in management and about factors that would influence their decision-making </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: GPs (n=72) were most likely to add <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (33.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RMOs (n=42) were more likely to add insulin (47.6%, p&lt;0.01 vs. GPs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Medical students (n=40) were more likely to review diet and observe (42.5%, p&lt;0.01 vs. GPs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant differences were observed between the 3 groups in what influenced their choice of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>GPs were most likely to take into account patient related factors such as patient's motivation to improve glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: GPs were less likely to initiate insulin therapy, and our results suggest that this may be due to their greater awareness of patient related barriers to commencing insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results justify support for continuing medical education of GPs that focuses on evidence based guidelines </plain></SENT>
