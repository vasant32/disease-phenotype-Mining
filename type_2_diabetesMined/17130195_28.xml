<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled trial in 80 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for 30 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The intervention group was treated with the IBGMS, while the control group made conventional office visits only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HbA1c (A1C) was performed at 3-month intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For measuring of the stability of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control, the SD value of A1C levels for each subject was used as the A1C fluctuation index (HFI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean A1C and HFI were significantly lower in the intervention group (n = 40) than in the control group (n = 40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(A1C [mean +/- SD] 6.9 +/- 0.9 vs. 7.5 +/- 1.0%, P = 0.009; HFI 0.47 +/- 0.23 vs. 0.78 +/- 0.51, P = 0.001; intervention versus control groups, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients in the intervention group with a basal A1C &gt;or=7% (n = 27) had markedly lower A1C levels than corresponding patients in the control group during the first 3 months and maintained more stable levels throughout the study (P = 0.022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Control patients with a basal A1C &lt;7% (n = 15) showed the characteristic bimodal distribution of A1C levels, whereas the A1C levels in the intervention group remained stable throughout the study with low HFI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Long-term use of the IBGMS has proven to be superior to conventional <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care systems based on office visits for controlling blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and achieving <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> stability </plain></SENT>
