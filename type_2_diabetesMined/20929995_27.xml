<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective database analysis was performed of the LifeLink database of medical and pharmaceutical insurance claims for June 2005 through March 2009 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patient outcomes were adjusted for differences in clinical and demographic characteristics and compared using propensity score-weighted discrete time survival analysis with time-varying exposure to exenatide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 39,275 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were treated with exenatide twice daily, and 381,218 patients were treated with other <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients who initiated exenatide were more likely to have prior <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and/or other comorbidities at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Exenatide-treated patients were less likely to have a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> event than non-exenatide-treated patients (hazard ratio 0.81; 95% CI 0.68-0.95; P = 0.01) and lower rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>-related hospitalization (0.88; 0.79-0.98; P = 0.02) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause hospitalization (0.94; 0.91-0.97; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
