<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM), although important for its pathophysiology, is not sufficient to establish the disease unless major deficiency of beta-cell function coexists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is demonstrated by the fact that near-physiological administration of insulin (CSII) achieved excellent blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control with doses similar to those used in insulin-deficient type 1 diabetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> beta-cell adapts well to the demands of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Also in hyperglycaemic states some degree of adaptation does exist and helps limit the severity of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate here that the mammalian target of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> (mTOR) system might play an important role in this adaptation, because blocking mTORC1 (complex 1) by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> in the nutritional <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> model Psammomys obesus caused severe impairment of beta-cell function, increased beta-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and progression of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, under exposure to high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and FFA (gluco-lipotoxicity), blocking mTORC1 in vitro reduced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and beta-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, according to the conditions of stress, mTOR may have beneficial or deleterious effects on the beta-cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>beta-Cell function in man can be reduced without T2DM/<z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prospective studies have shown subjects with reduced insulin response to present, several decades later, an increased incidence of IGT/T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>From these and other studies we conclude that T2DM develops on the grounds of beta-cells whose adaptation capacity to increased nutrient intake and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> is in the lower end of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> variation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Inborn and acquired factors that limit beta-cell function are diabetogenic only in a nutritional/metabolic environment that requires high functional capabilities from the beta-cell </plain></SENT>
