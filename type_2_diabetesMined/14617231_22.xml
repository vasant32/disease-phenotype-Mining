<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study compared the glycaemic control and safety profiles achieved with either twice daily BIAsp30 or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> not optimally controlled by oral hypoglycaemic agents (OHAs), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin or a combination of both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this 16-week multinational, parallel-group, double-blind trial, 403 such patients were randomized to receive either BIAsp30 or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin immediately before breakfast and evening meals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OHAs were discontinued at randomization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Efficacy was assessed by glycosylated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA1c) and self-recorded daily 8-point blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (BG) profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hypoglycaemic and other adverse events were the chosen safety parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HbA1c concentration decreased by &gt;0.6% (p &lt; 0.0001 vs. baseline) in both groups, with metabolic control continuing to improve throughout the trial without reaching a stable level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients who switched from once or twice daily <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> monotherapy to twice daily BIAsp30 achieved a significantly greater reduction in HbA1c (0.78%) than those randomized to twice daily <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin (0.58%; p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>BIAsp30 decreased mean daily postprandial glycaemic exposure to a greater extent than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin (mean difference = 0.69 mmol/l; p &lt; 0.0001), reflecting greater decreases in the postbreakfast and postdinner increments (of 1.26 and 1.33 mmol/l, respectively), although postlunch increment was relatively increased (by 0.56 mmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Despite the greater reduction in overall postprandial glycaemic exposure in the BIAsp30 group, the overall safety profile of BIAsp30 was equivalent to that of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin with &lt;2% of patients experiencing major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e>, and approximately 33% reporting minor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0745153" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemic episodes</z:e>, in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Twice daily BIAsp30 reduced postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> exposure to a significantly greater extent than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin and was at least as effective at reducing HbA1c in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Both insulins were well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In patients poorly controlled on OHAs or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> alone, glycaemic control can be improved by switching to twice daily BIAsp30, without increasing hypoglycaemic risk </plain></SENT>
