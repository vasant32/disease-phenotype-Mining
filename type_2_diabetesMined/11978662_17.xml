<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether this polymorphism influences lipolysis in isolated subcutaneous fat cells from 114 healthy <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Gbeta(3) protein content was markedly decreased in adipocytes of TT carriers, but the alternatively spliced short form of Gbeta(3) previously shown in platelets of 825T carriers was not detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fat cells of TT carriers showed a significant 10-fold decrease in the half-maximum effective concentration of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> selective for lipolytic beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenoceptors as well as for the antilipolytic alpha(2)A-adrenoceptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In TT carriers, maximum beta-adrenoceptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>-stimulated lipolysis was decreased, but the maximum antilipolytic effect of alpha(2)-adrenoceptors was less marked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">Norepinephrine</z:chebi> induced adipocyte lipolysis and circulating fasting levels of free fatty acids and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> were reduced by half in TT carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The polymorphism did not influence the adipocyte content of alpha(2)A-adrenoceptors, beta(2)-adrenoceptors, Galpha(i), or Galpha(s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the C825T variant of Gbeta(3) influences lipolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adipocytes of TT carriers have a lower Gbeta(3) protein content and a decreased function of native G(s)- as well as G(i)-coupled adrenoceptors, which reduces the lipolytic effect of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamines</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data differ from those obtained in other cell systems that have shown increased expression of an alternative spliced Gbeta(3) variant and enhanced G protein signaling in 825T carriers, indicating that the polymorphism has cell type-specific effects that may be of importance for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and other insulin-resistant conditions </plain></SENT>
