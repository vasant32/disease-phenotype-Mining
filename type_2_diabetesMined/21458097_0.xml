<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Omentin is a protein expressed and secreted from visceral but not subcutaneous adipose tissue, which increases insulin sensitivity in human adipocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its pathophysiologic role in humans remains largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study is to assess plasma omentin-1 levels in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) and matched control subjects and to investigate the effects of liraglutide on plasma omentin-1 levels in patients with T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty T2DM patients with poor glycemic control after more than 3 months of treatment with one or two OHA(s) (T2DM), and 30 matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> glycaemic controls (NGT) participated in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The T2DM group was given an injection of liraglutide once-daily for 16 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma omentin-1 levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the relationship between plasma omentin-1 levels and metabolic parameters was also analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Plasma omentin-1 levels were lower in T2DM than in the control (19.3 ± 4.0 μg/L vs. 26.4 ± 6.0 μg/L, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasma omentin-1 levels increased significantly in T2DM patients after treatment with liraglutide compared with pre-treatment (19.3 ± 4.0 μg/L vs. 21.2 ± 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>9 μg/L, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> diabetic patients, multiple regression analysis showed that FINS and HOMA-IR were independently associated with plasma omentin-1 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In T2DM patients, plasma omentin-1 levels decreased, but significantly increased after the treatment with liraglutide and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that liraglutide may play a role in increasing omentin-1 levels in T2DM patients </plain></SENT>
