<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We enrolled 6,362 Japanese men aged 35-61 years who did not have <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, or liver <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> at study entry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was defined as a fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) level &gt; or =126 mg/dl or was diagnosed by a physician </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data on alcohol consumption were obtained from questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We confirmed 456 cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during the 62,016 person-years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The relationship between daily alcohol consumption and the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among lean men and among men with a higher BMI was paradoxical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among lean men (BMI &lt; or =22.0 kg/m2), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0687132" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">heavy drinking</z:e> was associated with an increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Men who consumed &gt; or =50.1 ml/day of alcohol had a relative risk (RR) of 2.48 (95% CI 1.31-4.71) compared with nondrinkers after adjusting for age, BMI, regular physical exercise, parental history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, smoking habits, and FPG level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, among men with a BMI &gt; or =22.1 kg/m2, moderate drinking (29.1-50.0 ml/day) was associated with a decreased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Daily moderate drinkers had a multiple adjusted RR of 0.58 (0.39-0.87) compared with nondrinkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among men with a BMI &gt; or =22.1 kg/m2, moderate alcohol consumption was associated with a reduced risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but among lean men (BMI &lt; or =22.0 kg/m2), heavy alcohol consumption was associated with an increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
