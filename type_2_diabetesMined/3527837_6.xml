<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have developed a new method of detecting islet cell antibodies using peroxidase-labeled protein A, and have determined the incidence of ICA in Type 1 (insulin-dependent) <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In our method, fresh frozen sections of human pancreas and serum samples were incubated and then treated with peroxidase-labeled protein A at room temperature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Conjugates of peroxidase and protein A were subjected to Sephadex G-200 column chromatography, and only the 80,000 dalton peak was employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The treated sections were allowed to react with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">haematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin (HE) to confirm the localization of islet cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With this method, human pancreatic tissues can be used regardless of age and blood type, and the stained sections can be stored for more than 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum samples obtained from 52 patients with Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 54 with Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 100 control subjects were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, islet cell antibodies were detected in 14 of 14 (0.5 years after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>), 3 of 6 (0.5-1 years after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>), 7 of 16 (1-5 years after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>) and 2 of 16 (more than 5 years after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, only 4 of 54 patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and none of the controls were ICA positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that, with our newly developed method using peroxidase-labeled protein A, ICA is present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Japanese Type 1 diabetic patients whose diabetic manifestations are less than 0.5 years duration from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
