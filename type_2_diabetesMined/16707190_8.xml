<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine beta-cell function with a single sampling of blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Examination of fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (F-BG, mM) and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (F-CPR, nM) levels in seven post-islet-transplanted states of four patients revealed a linear relationship between F-BG and F-CPR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Assuming that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects aged &lt;40 years have 100% pancreatic beta-cell function, we developed the secretory units of islets in transplantation (SUIT) as an index of beta-cell function by the formula: 250 x F-CPR/(F-BG-3.43) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The SUIT index was correlated with the stimulated C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels not only in islet-transplanted patients (R2 = 0.68, P &lt; 0.05) but also in type 2 patients (R2 = 0.34, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since the SUIT index can be calculated from data obtained at a single fasting blood sampling and predict the pancreatic beta-cell function, the formula may be a useful tool in clinical management of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
