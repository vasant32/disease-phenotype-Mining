<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Herein, we examine measures of β-cell function and insulin sensitivity from an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) over a 4-year period among the three treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Recently diagnosed, drug-naïve patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (4,360 total) were treated for a median of 4.0 years with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi> and were examined with periodic metabolic testing using an OGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Measures of β-cell function and insulin sensitivity from an OGTT showed more favorable changes over time with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> versus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Persistent improvements were seen in those who completed 4 years of monotherapy and marked deterioration of β-cell function in those who failed to maintain adequate <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control with initial monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The favorable combined changes in β-cell function and insulin sensitivity over time with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> appear to be responsible for its superior glycemic durability over <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi> as initial monotherapy in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
