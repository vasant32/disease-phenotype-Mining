<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is a progressive syndrome that evolves toward complete insulin deficiency during the patient's life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A stepwise approach for its treatment should be tailored according to the natural course of the disease, including adding insulin when hypoglycemic oral agent failure occurs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment with insulin alone should eventually be considered in a relevant number of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Experience has shown the protective effects of insulin on beta-cell survival and function, resulting in more stable metabolic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, treatment with most insulin secretagogues has been associated with increased beta-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, reduced responsiveness to high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and impairment of myocardial function during ischemic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, macrovascular complications are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011998'>postprandial hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, indicating the need for tight glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Insulin treatment, especially with rapid-acting analogs, has been demonstrated to successfully control postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excursions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, a reason for concern with regard to combined therapy is represented by the evidence that polipharmacy reduces compliance to the treatment regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This can be particularly relevant in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> usually taking drugs for complications and for concomitant diseases with consequent deterioration not only of metabolic control but also of other conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, therapy with insulin alone immediately after hypoglycemic oral agent failure may be a useful and safe therapeutic approach in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
