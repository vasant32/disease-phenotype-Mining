<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Offspring of mothers with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are at risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> in later life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In adults, markers of subclinical <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> (C-reactive protein [CRP] and interleukin [IL]-6) and endothelial activation (intracellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule [ICAM]-1) are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and higher risk for incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined whether these biomarkers were elevated at birth in offspring of type 1 diabetic mothers (OT1DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Umbilical cord plasma CRP, IL-6, and ICAM-1 were measured in 139 OT1DM and 48 control offspring, with analysis relative to fetal <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and hormonal axes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: OT1DM had higher median (interquartile range) CRP (OT1DM 0.17 mg/l [0.13-0.22] vs. control subjects 0.14 mg/l [0.12-0.17], P &lt; 0.001) and ICAM-1 (OT1DM 180 ng/ml [151-202] vs. control subjects 166 ng/ml [145-187], P = 0.047) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IL-6 was not different after necessary adjustment for mode of delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Birth weight was unrelated to inflammatory indexes; however, leptin was correlated with CRP (control subjects r = 0.33, P = 0.02; OT1DM r = 0.41, P &lt; 0.001) and with IL-6 (r = 0.23, P &lt; 0.01) and ICAM-1 (r = 0.29, P &lt; 0.001) in OT1DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In OT1DM, CRP correlated with maternal glycemic control (A1C at 35-40 weeks; r = 0.28, P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, leptin was a determinant of CRP (P &lt; 0.001), ICAM-1 (P = 0.003), and IL-6 (P = 0.02) in OT1DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Inflammatory measures demonstrated positive relationships with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> in OT1DM (CRP, IL-6, and ICAM-1 P &lt; 0.05) and control subjects (ICAM-1 P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Inflammatory markers are increased in OT1DM and are related to measures of fetal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e>, particularly leptin, and maternal glycemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Subclinical <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> is a novel component of the diabetic intrauterine environment and should be considered a potential etiological mechanism for in utero programming of disease </plain></SENT>
