<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ten variants were genotyped in a family-based sample (n = 1,037), and 1 variant (rs3738435) located in the 5' untranslated region of an alternative transcript was found to be modestly associated with both early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin response in a small subset of these subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To better assess whether this variant has a role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin secretion, which could affect risk for early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, rs3738435 was genotyped in a larger group of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-tolerant Pima Indians who had measures of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin secretion (n = 282) and a larger case-control group of Pima Indians selected for early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 348 case subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> &lt;25 years; n = 392 nondiabetic control subjects aged &gt;45 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genotyping in these larger sets of subjects confirmed that the C allele of rs3738435 was associated with a reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin response (adjusted P = 0.00006) and was also modestly associated with increased risk of early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (adjusted P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
