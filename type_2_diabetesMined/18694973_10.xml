<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Toxic IAPP aggregates likely contribute to the progressive loss of beta-cells in this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used cultured human islets as an ex vivo model of amyloid formation to investigate whether suppression of proIAPP expression would inhibit islet amyloid formation and enhance beta-cell survival and function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Islets from cadaveric organ donors were transduced with a recombinant adenovirus expressing a short interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (siRNA) designed to suppress human proIAPP (Ad-hProIAPP-siRNA), cultured for 10 days, and then assessed for the presence of islet amyloid, beta-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and beta-cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thioflavine S-positive amyloid deposits were clearly present after 10 days of culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transduction with Ad-hProIAPP-siRNA reduced proIAPP expression by 75% compared with nontransduced islets as assessed by Western blot analysis of islet lysates 4 days after transduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>siRNA-mediated inhibition of IAPP expression decreased islet amyloid area by 63% compared with nontransduced cultured islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> assessed by transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick-end labeling staining was decreased by 50% in transduced cultured human islets, associated with a significant increase in islet insulin content (control, 100 +/- 4 vs. +Ad-siRNA, 153 +/- 22%, P &lt; 0.01) and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion (control, 222 +/- 33 vs. +Ad-siRNA, 285 +/- 21 percent basal, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that inhibition of IAPP synthesis prevents amyloid formation and beta-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in cultured human islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Inhibitors of IAPP synthesis may have therapeutic value in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
