<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The minor G-allele of rs577492 was associated with elevated fasting serum cholesterol and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short stature</z:hpo> (P = 3.0  </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The findings are not corrected for multiple comparisons and are by nature exploratory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, if replicated, these findings suggest that less severe variation in a gene locus known to harbor severe mutations causing monogenic syndromes may modestly increase susceptibility to common metabolic and anthropometrical phenotypes of polygenic origin </plain></SENT>
