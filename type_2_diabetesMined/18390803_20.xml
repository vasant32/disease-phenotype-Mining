<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Analysis was based on 7,339 participants of the Whitehall II study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dietary intake was measured using a 127-item food frequency questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used the reduced rank regression method to determine dietary patterns using the homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> as the intermediate or response variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The association between the dietary pattern identified and incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was investigated using Cox proportional hazard regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified a dietary pattern characterized by high consumption of low-calorie/diet soft drinks, onions, sugar-sweetened beverages, burgers and sausages, crisps and other snacks, and white bread and low consumption of medium-/high-fiber breakfast cereals, jam, French dressing/vinaigrette, and wholemeal bread </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Higher dietary pattern scores were associated with increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (hazard ratio for top quartile 2.95 [95% CI 2.19-3.97]; adjusted for age, sex, and energy misreporting) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This relationship was attenuated after adjustment for ethnicity, employment grade, health behaviors (smoking, alcohol use, and physical activity) but remained significant after further adjustment for blood pressure and BMI (1.51 [1.10-2.09]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A dietary pattern associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> predicts type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk after adjustment for a range of confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study adds to the evidence that dietary patterns are an important risk factor for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
