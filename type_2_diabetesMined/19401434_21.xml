<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We generated transgenic mice overexpressing the hGPR40 gene under control of the mouse insulin II promoter and used them to examine the role of GPR40 in the regulation of insulin secretion and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> (C57BL/6J) and diabetic (KK) mice overexpressing the hGPR40 gene under control of the insulin II promoter were generated, and their <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism and islet function were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In comparison with nontransgenic littermates, hGPR40 transgenic mice exhibited improved oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance with an increase in insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although islet morphologic analysis showed no obvious differences between hGPR40 transgenic and nontransgenic mice, isolated islets from hGPR40 transgenic mice had enhanced insulin secretion in response to high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (16 mmol/l) compared with those from nontransgenic mice, and they both had similar low <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (3 mmol/l)-stimulated insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, hGPR40 transgenic islets significantly <z:mp ids='MP_0003058'>increased insulin secretion</z:mp> against a naturally occurring <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> in the presence of 11 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>hGPR40 transgenic mice were also found to be resistant to high-fat diet-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo>, and hGPR40 transgenic mice harboring KK background showed augmented insulin secretion and improved oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance compared with nontransgenic littermates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that GPR40 may have a role in regulating <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion and plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels in vivo and that pharmacological activation of GPR40 may provide a novel insulin secretagogue beneficial for the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
