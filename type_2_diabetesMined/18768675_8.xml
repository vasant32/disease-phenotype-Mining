<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in normotensive patients and patients with WCH selected from a cohort of 319 type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Normotension was defined by office blood pressure &lt;140/90 mmHg and daytime blood pressure &lt;135/85 mmHg on ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>WCH was defined as office blood pressure &gt;or=140/90 mmHg and daytime blood pressure &lt;135/85 mmHg on ABPM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects were evaluated for diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> (24-h urinary albumin excretion rate) and diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (classified according to the Global Diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>Retinopathy</z:hpo> Group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-six type 2 diabetic patients had WCH (14.4%; mean age 56.6 years; 45.3% men) and 117 had normotension (36.6%; mean age 55.8 years; 37.5% men) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These groups did not differ in clinical and main laboratory characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Systolic ABPM (24-h: 124.7 +/- 6.7 vs. 121.0 +/- 8.5 mmHg, P = 0.01 and daytime: 126.6 +/- 7.2 vs. 123.2 +/- 8.2 mmHg, P = 0.01) and blood pressure loads were higher in subjects with WCH than in the normotensive subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>WCH was associated with an increased risk for macroalbuminuria (odds ratio 4.9 [95% CI 1.3-18.7], P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis models, WCH was associated with macroalbuminuria (2.0 [1.3-3.2], P = 0.02) and increased the risk for both nonproliferative and proliferative diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (2.7 [1.2-6.6], P = 0.02 for any degree of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>) after adjustments for confounding factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Type 2 diabetic patients with WCH have an increased risk for diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> and diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, WCH should not be considered a harmless condition, and treatment should be considered </plain></SENT>
