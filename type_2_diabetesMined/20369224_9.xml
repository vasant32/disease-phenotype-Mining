<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Information on this issue is lacking for type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated whether NAFLD is associated with increased prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> and CKD in type 1 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> type 1 diabetic patients (n = 202) who regularly attended our <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> clinic and did not have any clinical evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> or other secondary causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Main study measures were detection of NAFLD (by patient history and liver ultrasound), diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (diagnosed by ophthalmoscopy) and CKD (defined as abnormal <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> or estimated GFR of &lt; or =60 ml min(-1) 1.73 m(-2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The age- and sex-adjusted prevalence of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (53.2 vs 19.8%) and CKD (37.8 vs 9.9%) was markedly higher in patients with NAFLD than in those without (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In multivariate logistic regression analysis, NAFLD was associated with prevalent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (adjusted OR 3.31, 95% CI 1.4-7.6, p = 0.005) or CKD (adjusted OR 3.90, 95% CI 1.5-10.1, p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These associations were independent of age, sex, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration, HbA(1c), medication use and presence of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that ultrasound-diagnosed NAFLD is associated, independently of several confounding factors, with a higher prevalence of CKD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> in type 1 diabetic individuals </plain></SENT>
