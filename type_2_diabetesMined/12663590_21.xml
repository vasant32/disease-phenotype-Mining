<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Failure to meet goals for glycemic control in primary care settings may be due in part to lack of information critical to guide intensification of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective is to determine whether rapid-turnaround A1c availability would improve intensification of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> therapy and reduce A1c levels in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this prospective controlled trial, A1c was determined on capillary <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> samples and made available to providers, either during ("rapid") or after ("routine") the patient visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Frequency of intensification of pharmacological <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> therapy in inadequately controlled patients and A1c levels were assessed at baseline and after follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We recruited 597 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were 79% female and 96% African American, with average age of 61 years, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> 10 years, BMI 33 kg/m(2), and A1c 8.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rapid and routine groups had similar clinical demographics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rapid A1c availability resulted in more frequent intensification of therapy when A1c was &gt;/=7.0% at the baseline visit (51 vs. 32% of patients, P = 0.01), particularly when A1c was &gt;8.0% and/or random <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was in the 8.4-14.4 mmol/l range (151-250 mg/dl) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 275 patients with two follow-up visits, A1c fell significantly in the rapid group (from 8.4 to 8.1%, P = 0.04) but not in the routine group (from 8.1 to 8.0%, P = 0.31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Availability of rapid A1c measurements increased the frequency of intensification of therapy and lowered A1c levels in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in an urban neighborhood health center </plain></SENT>
