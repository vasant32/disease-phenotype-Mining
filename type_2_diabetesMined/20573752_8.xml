<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The long-term predictive power and comparability of elevated A1C with the currently used high-risk indicators remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed A1C, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT), and impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (IFG) as predictors of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) at 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This prospective population-based study of 593 inhabitants from northern Finland, born in 1935, was conducted between 1996 and 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) was conducted at baseline and follow-up, and A1C was determined at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Those with a history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were excluded from the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Elevated A1C was defined as 5.7-6.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was confirmed by two OGTTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular outcome was measured as incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate log-binomial regression models were used to predict <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> mortality at 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Receiver operating characteristic curves compared predictive values of A1C, IGT, and IFG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during the follow-up was 17.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Two of three of the cases of newly diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were predicted by a raise in &gt;or=1 of the markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Elevated A1C, IGT, or IFG preceded <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in 32.8, 40.6, and 21.9%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> was predicted by an intermediate and diabetic range of 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> but only by diabetic A1C levels in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A1C predicted 10-year risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at a range of A1C 5.7-6.4% but <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> only in women at A1C &gt;or=6.5% </plain></SENT>
