<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> is a well-established risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>New therapeutic approaches have been developed recently based on the incretin phenomenon, such as the degradation-resistant incretin mimetic exenatide and the glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) analogue liraglutide, as well as the dipeptidyl dipeptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitors, such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi>, vildagliptin, saxagliptin, which increase the circulating bioactive GLP-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>GLP-1 exerts its <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-regulatory action via stimulation of insulin secretion and glucagon suppression by a <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent way, as well as by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> via inhibition of gastric emptying and reduction of appetite and food intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These actions are mediated through GLP-1 receptors (GLP-1Rs), although GLP-1R-independent pathways have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Except for the pancreatic islets, GLP-1Rs are also present in several other tissues including central and peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> systems, gastrointestinal tract, heart and vasculature, suggesting a pleiotropic activity of GLP-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Indeed, accumulating data from both animal and human studies suggest a beneficial effect of GLP-1 and its metabolites on myocardium, endothelium and vasculature, as well as potential anti-inflammatory and antiatherogenic actions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Growing lines of evidence have also confirmed these actions for exenatide and to a lesser extent for liraglutide and DPP-4 inhibitors compared with placebo or standard <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This suggests a potential cardioprotective effect beyond <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Whether these agents actually decrease <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> outcomes remains to be confirmed by large randomized placebo-controlled trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This review discusses the role of GLP-1 on the cardiovascular system and addresses the impact of GLP-1-based therapies on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> outcomes </plain></SENT>
