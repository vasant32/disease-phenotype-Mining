<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: In short-term studies, adoption of a traditional diet is associated with reduction in <z:mp ids='MP_0005266'>metabolic abnormalities</z:mp> often found in populations experiencing rapid lifestyle changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the long-term effects of a self-assessed traditional or nontraditional dietary pattern on the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in 165 nondiabetic Pima Indians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Dietary intake was assessed in 1988 by a quantitative food frequency method, and subjects were asked to classify their diet as "Indian," "Anglo," or "mixed." The Indian diet reflects a preference for Sonoran-style and traditional desert foods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Anglo diet reflects a preference for non-Sonoran-style foods typical of the remaining regions of the U.S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In women, the intake of complex carbohydrates, dietary fiber, insoluble fiber, vegetable proteins, and the proportion of total calories from complex carbohydrate and vegetable proteins were significantly higher (P &lt; 0.05) in the Indian than in the Anglo diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mixed diet was intermediate in of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these constituents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In men, the intake for these nutrients was also higher in the Indian than in the Anglo group, but not significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> developed in 36 subjects (8 men and 28 women) during 6.2 years of follow-up (range 0.9-10.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The crude incidence rates of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were 23 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>35, and 63 cases per 1,000 person-years in the Indian. mixed, and Anglo groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for age, sex, BMI, and total energy intake in a proportional hazards model, the risk of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the Anglo-diet group was 2.5 times as high (95%) CI 0.9-7.2) and the rate in the mixed-diet group was 1.3 times as high (0.6-3.3) as in the Indian-diet group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the adoption of an Anglo diet may increase the risk of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Pima Indians, but it does not provide unequivocal evidence for or against this hypothesis </plain></SENT>
