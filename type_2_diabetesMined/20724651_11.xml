<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Placental tissues and maternal and cord blood samples were obtained from 48 women at term including 23 subjects with gestational IGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Leptin DNA methylation, gene expression levels, and circulating concentration were measured using the Sequenom EpiTYPER system, quantitative real-time RT-PCR, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IGT was assessed after a 75-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) at 24-28 weeks of gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We have shown that placental leptin gene DNA methylation levels were correlated with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels (2-h post-OGTT) in women with IGT (fetal side: ρ=-0.44, P≤0.05; maternal side: ρ=0.53, P≤0.01) and with decreased leptin gene expression (n=48; ρ≥-0.30, P≤0.05) in the whole cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Placental leptin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels accounted for 16% of the variance in maternal circulating leptin concentration (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: IGT during pregnancy was associated with leptin gene DNA methylation adaptations with potential functional impacts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These epigenetic changes provide novel mechanisms that could contribute to explaining the detrimental health effects associated with fetal programming, such as long-term increased risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
