<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we aimed to explore the effect of the TCF7L2 polymorphisms in a Han Chinese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We genotyped 20 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the TCF7L2 gene in 1,520 unrelated subjects from a Han Chinese population in Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The associations of SNPs and haplotypes with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure of the TCF7L2 gene were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The previously reported SNPs rs7903146 T- and rs12255372 T-alleles of the TCF7L2 gene were rare and were not associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a Chinese population, which may attribute to the low frequencies of these two SNPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SNP rs290487 located in an LD block close to the 3' end of the gene was associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (allele-specific P = 0.0021; permuted P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio was 1.36 for the CT genotype (95% CI 1.08-1.71; P = 0.0063) and 1.51 for the CC genotype (1.10 -2.07; P = 0.0085) compared with the TT genotype, corresponding to a population attributable risk fraction of 18.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The haplotypes composed of rs290487 were also significantly associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (global P = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We identified a novel risk-conferring genetic variant of TCF7L2 for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a Chinese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data suggested that the TCF7L2 genetic polymorphisms are major determinants for risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the Chinese population </plain></SENT>
