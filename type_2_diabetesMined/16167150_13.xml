<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the effects of genetic variation in UCP2 on type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, as well as on metabolic phenotypes related to these diseases, in Pima Indians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The coding and untranslated regions of UCP2, and approximately 1 kb of the 5' upstream region, were sequenced in DNA samples taken from 83 extremely <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> Pima Indians who were not first-degree relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five variants were identified: (1) a -866G/A in the 5' upstream region; (2) a G/A in exon 2; (3) a C/T resulting in an Ala55Val substitution in exon 4; and (4, 5) two insertion/deletions (ins/del; 45-bp and 3-bp) in the 3' untranslated region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the 83 subjects whose DNA was sequenced, the -866G/A was in complete genotypic concordance with the Ala55Val and the 3-bp ins/del polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The G/A polymorphism in exon 2 was extremely rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To capture the common variation in this gene for association analyses, the -866G/A variant (as a representative of Ala55Val and the 3-bp ins/del polymorphism) and the 45-bp ins/del were also genotyped for 864 full-blooded Pima Indians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neither of these variants was associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or body mass index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, in a subgroup of 185 subjects who had undergone detailed metabolic measurements, these variants were associated with 24-h energy expenditure as measured in a human metabolic chamber (p=0.007 for the 45-bp ins/del and p=0.03 for the -866G/A after adjusting for age, sex, family membership, fat-free mass and fat mass) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our data indicate that variation in UCP2 may play a role in energy metabolism, but this gene does not contribute significantly to the aetiology of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in Pima Indians </plain></SENT>
