<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The San Antonio Family <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp>/Gallbladder Study was initiated to identify susceptibility genes for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Evidence was previously reported of linkage to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on 10q with suggestive evidence on 3p and 9p in a genome-wide scan of 440 individuals from 27 pedigrees ascertained through a single diabetic proband </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, the study was expanded to include 906 individuals from 39 extended Mexican-American pedigrees, two additional examination cycles approximately 5.3 and 7.6 years after baseline, and genotypes for a new set of genome-wide markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we completed a second genome-wide linkage scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using information from a participant's most recent exam, the prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in nonprobands was 21.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We performed genome-wide variance components-based genetic analysis on the discrete trait <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> using a liability model and on the quantitative Martingale residual obtained from modeling age of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosis using Cox proportional hazard models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Controlling for age and age(2), our strongest evidence for linkage to the trait <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the quantitative Martingale residual was on chromosome 3p at marker D3S2406 with multipoint empirical logarithm of odds scores of 1.87 and 3.76, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In summary, we report evidence for linkage to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on chromosome 3p in a region previously identified in at least three independent populations </plain></SENT>
