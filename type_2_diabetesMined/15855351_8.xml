<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the Kir6.2 subunit causes a point mutation of Glu23 to lysine and reduces the ATP sensitivity of pancreatic K(ATP) channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The SNP found in 58% of Caucasians accounts for 15% of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we show evidence for dysregulations of muscular K(ATP) channels with the E23K variation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We were particularly interested in the channel modulation by intracellular protons, as pH changes widely and frequently in skeletal muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, we found that the defect of the E23K variant was more related to pH than ATP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A level of intracellular acidification seen during exercise not only activated the E23K channel more readily than the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp>, but also relieved the channel inhibition by ATP, leading to a vast increase in the channel open-state probability by approximately sevenfold at pH 6.8 over the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> channel at pH 7.4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Considering the reduction in sarcolemmal excitability, <z:mp ids='MP_0003646'>muscle fatigue</z:mp>, and impairment of muscular <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake found previously by genetically disrupting K(ATP) channels, it is likely that the E23K variant in muscular K(ATP) channels affects systemic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis and poses an important risk factor for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
