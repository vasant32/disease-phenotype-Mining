<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the use of percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (PENS) in the management of patients with painful diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 50 adult patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and peripheral neuropathic pain of &gt;6 months duration involving the lower extremities were randomly assigned to receive active PENS (needles with electrical stimulation at an alternating frequency of 15 and 30 Hz) and sham (needles only) treatments for 3 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each series of treatments was administered for 30 min three times a week according to a standardized protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After a 1-week washout period, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were subsequently switched to the other modality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A 10-cm visual analog scale (VAS) was used to assess pain, physical activity, and quality of sleep before each session </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The changes in VAS scores and daily requirements for oral <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesic</z:chebi> medication were determined during each 3-week treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients completed the MOS 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), the Beck <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Inventory (BDI), and the Profile of Mood States (POMS) before and after completion of each treatment modality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the end of the crossover study, a patient preference questionnaire was used to compare the effectiveness of the two modalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with the pain VAS scores before active (6.2 +/- 1.0) and sham (6.4 +/- 0.9) treatments, pain scores after treatment were reduced to 2.5 +/- 0.8 and 6.3 +/- 1.1, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With active PENS treatment, the VAS activity and sleep scores were significantly improved from 5.2 +/- 1.0 and 5.8 +/- 1.3 to 7.9 +/- 1.0 and 8.3 +/- 0.7, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The VAS scores for pain, activity, and sleep were unchanged from baseline values after the sham treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients' daily oral nonopioid <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesic</z:chebi> requirements decreased by 49 and 14% after active and sham PENS treatments, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The post-treatment physical and mental components of the SF-36, the BDI, and the POMS <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> showed a significantly greater improvement with active versus sham treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Active PENS treatment improved the neuropathic pain symptoms in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PENS is a useful nonpharmacological therapeutic modality for treating diabetic neuropathic pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In addition to decreasing extremity pain, PENS therapy improved physical activity, sense of well-being, and quality of sleep while reducing the need for oral nonopioid <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesic</z:chebi> medication </plain></SENT>
