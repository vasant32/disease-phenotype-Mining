<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here the design of the lifestyle-intervention study is described and results are presented from the preliminary population screening, conducted between March 1999 and June 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In total, 2,820 subjects with an increased risk of having disturbances in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis (i.e. age &gt;40 years and BMI&gt;25 kg/m(2) or a family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) underwent a first oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011014'>Abnormal glucose homeostasis</z:hpo> was detected in 826 subjects (30.4%): 226 type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (type 2DM, 8.3%), 215 impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (IFG, 7.9%) and 385 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT, 14.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both increasing age and BMI were strongly related to the prevalence of IGT and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After a second OGTT, 114 subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> and in otherwise good health were eligible for participation in the intervention study (SLIM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The high prevalence of disturbances in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis observed in the preliminary screening underscore the importance of early (lifestyle) interventions in those at risk for developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SLIM will address this topic in the Dutch population </plain></SENT>
