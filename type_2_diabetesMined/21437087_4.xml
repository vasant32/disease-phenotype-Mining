<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Active disease is associated with low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> resulting in part from the activation of the innate immune system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, this activation leads to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-α, interleukin-1β and interleukin-6 that block major anabolic cascades downstream of insulin signaling and thus disrupt insulin homeostasis and action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cytokines also trigger the production of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase reactants such as C-reactive protein, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, serum amyloid-A, and haptoglobin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The elevated synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase proteins (inflammatory network) characterizes the early (or pre-clinical) stages of T2DM and exhibits a graded increase with the disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Current evidence suggests that understanding inflammatory networks can point to new biomarkers that may permit capturing the interaction between genetic and environmental risk factors in the pathogenesis of T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Such biomarkers have a significant public health potential in the prediction of disease occurrence beyond risk factors presently monitored, such as family history, lifestyle assessment and standard clinical chemistry profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, inflammatory markers may assist in the evaluation of novel strategies for prevention, particularly in relation to micronutrients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This review discusses the current knowledge linking T2DM risk to inflammatory signaling pathways interacting with the innate immunity system and the prospect of inflammatory markers serving as molecular targets for prevention and/or biomarkers for early risk prediction of T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The potential of micronutrients replenishment to improve insulin action by attenuating <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> is also evaluated in the context of the public health relevance of this approach </plain></SENT>
