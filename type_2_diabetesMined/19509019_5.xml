<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Markers reliably identifying vascular damage and risk in diabetic patients are rare, and reports on associations of serum adiponectin with macrovascular disease have been inconsistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast to existing data on serum adiponectin, this study assesses whether urinary adiponectin excretion might represent a more consistent vascular damage marker in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Adiponectin distribution in human kidney biopsies was assessed by immunohistochemistry, and urinary adiponectin isoforms were characterized by Western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Total urinary adiponectin excretion rate was measured in 156 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who had a history of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> and 40 healthy control subjects using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Atherosclerotic burden was assessed by common carotid artery intima-media-thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A homogenous staining of adiponectin was found on the endothelial surface of glomerular capillaries and intrarenal arterioles in nondiabetic kidneys, whereas staining was decreased in diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Low-molecular adiponectin isoforms ( approximately 30-70 kDa) were detected in urine by Western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Urinary adiponectin was significantly increased in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (7.68 +/- 14.26 vs. control subjects: 2.91 +/- 3.85 microg/g <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, P = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among type 2 diabetic patients, adiponectinuria was associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> (r = 0.479, P &lt; 0.001) and proved to be a powerful independent predictor of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> (beta = 0.360, P &lt; 0.001) in multivariable regression analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In a risk prediction model including variables of the UK Prospective <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> risk engine urinary adiponectin, but not the albumin excretion rate, added significant value for the prediction of increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> (P = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Quantification of urinary adiponectin excretion appears to be an independent indicator of vascular damage potentially identifying an increased risk for vascular events </plain></SENT>
