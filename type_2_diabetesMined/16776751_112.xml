<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This analysis examined the effects of exenatide on glycaemic control and weight over an 82-week period in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DM2</z:e> unable to achieve adequate glycaemic control with sulphonylurea (SU) and/or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (MET) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This interim analysis is of 314 patients who received exenatide in the 30-week placebo-controlled trials and subsequently in 52 weeks of open-label uncontrolled extension studies for 82 weeks of exenatide in total </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients continued their SU and/or MET regimens throughout </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients completed 82 weeks of exenatide treatment [n = 314, 63% M, age 56 +/- 10 years, weight 99 +/- 21 kg, body mass index 34 +/- 6 kg/m2, A1C 8.3 +/- 1.0% (mean +/- SD)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reduction in A1C from baseline to week 30 [-0.9 +/- 0.1% (mean +/- SE)] was sustained to week 82 (-1.1 +/- 0.1%), with 48% of patients achieving A1C &lt; or = 7% at week 82 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At week 30, exenatide <z:mp ids='MP_0001262'>reduced body weight</z:mp> (a secondary endpoint) from baseline (-2.1 +/- 0.2 kg), with progressive reduction at week 82 (-4.4 +/- 0.3 kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similar results were observed for the intent-to-treat population (n = 551), with reductions in A1C and weight at week 82 of -0.8 +/- 0.1% and -3.5 +/- 0.2 kg respectively </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most frequent adverse events were generally mild-to-moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
