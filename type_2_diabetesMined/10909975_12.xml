<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Insulin stimulation of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthesis was maximal in myoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake (fold-stimulation over basal uptake) was decreased in relative compared with control myoblasts at 0.001 micromol/l (0.93 +/- 0.05 [mean +/- SE] vs. 1.15 +/- 0.06, P &lt; 0.05) and 0.1 micromol/l (1.38 +/- 0.10 vs. 1.69 +/- 0.08, P = 0.025) insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Insulin responsiveness was markedly impaired in 5 of the relative myoblast cultures, and in 4 of these, there was an associated increase in basal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake (76.7 +/- 7.0 vs. 47.4 +/- 5.5 pmol x min(-1) x mg(-1) protein, relative vs. control; P &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of insulin receptor substrate 1, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, protein kinase B, and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in the relative cultures with impaired insulin responsiveness </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the persistence of impaired insulin responsiveness in some of the relative cultures supports the role of inherited factors in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and that the association with increased basal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake suggests that the 2 abnormalities may be linked </plain></SENT>
