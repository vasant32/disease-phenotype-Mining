<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a case of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> presenting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>hypothyroidism</z:hpo> due to <z:mp ids='MP_0001433'>overeating</z:mp> of seaweed that was noticed as a result of a discrepancy between glycated albumin (GA) and glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (GHb) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 71-year-old woman was undergoing managed treatment with oral medicines and insulin for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> with no sign of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000820'>thyroid disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Her thyroid function was euthyroid without aid of thyroid hormone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the patient's thyroid autoantibodies were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifteen weeks prior to indications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>hypothyroidism</z:hpo>, she had started to consume large amounts (100-200 g dry weight equivalent) of cooked "wakame" seaweed every morning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Just before admission to our hospital, her GA was 26.9%, while GHb and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> remained within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ranges (less than 5.6%, and 106 mg, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This discrepancy between GA and GHb drew our attention to the development of complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Naive interview of the patient led us to believe a thyroid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0599750" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hormone deficiency</z:e> existed, though without any related complaints or findings, such as non-pitting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, cold intolerance, or easy fatiguing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seaweed consumption was stopped and periodic observation of thyroid function started </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As thyroid hormone levels moved into <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range, GA and GHb returned to their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> relative ratio after 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, measurement of the relative ratio of GA and GHb may be useful for glycemic monitoring, with the potential as a readily available glycemic control marker for patients with changeable complications </plain></SENT>
