<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To study islet vascular regulation without confounding effects of the exocrine blood vessels, we have developed a technique enabling us to isolate single pancreatic islets and then to perfuse them using their endogenous vasculature for distribution of the medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This made it possible to directly study the vascular reactivity of islet arterioles to different substances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We confirmed that control of islet blood flow is mainly located at the precapillary level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As expected, administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> and l-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="29785">nitro</z:chebi>-arginine <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> contracted islet arterioles, whereas nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> dilated them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>d-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, the main insulin secretagogue, had a selective dilating effect on smooth muscle in islet arterioles but not in glomerular afferent arterioles </plain></SENT>
