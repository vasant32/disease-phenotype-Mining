<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The active enantiomers of 4-methoxyphenyl-[4-(4-methoxyphenyl)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridin-5-yl]methanone (Compound A-1) and 4-methoxyphenyl-[4-(4-trifluoromethoxyphenyl)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridin-5-yl]methanone (Compound B-1) were characterized as inhibitors of the G-6-Pase catalytic protein using pig and rat liver microsomes and cultured rat hepatocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both compounds were found to be potent competitive inhibitors of the G-6-Pase catalytic protein obtained from pig and rat liver microsomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The K(i) values (microM) were calculated to be 0.61 +/- 0.02 and 0.63 +/- 0.08 for compound A-1 and B-1 on intact pig microsomes, and 0.27 +/- 0.02 and 0.29 +/- 0.06 on disrupted pig microsomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The corresponding values for rat liver microsomes were found to be 3.3 +/- 0.6 and 4.0 +/- 1.2 for compound A-1 and B-1 on intact microsomes, and 1.54 +/- 0.1 and 1.21 +/- 0.1 on disrupted microsomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compound A-1 was also able to inhibit pyrophosphatase activities from both intact and disrupted microsomes with equal potency (IC50; 0.43-0.55 microm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using cultured rat hepatocytes and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> as the substrate, these compounds were able to prevent <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production up to 60% with a concomitant increase in the G-6-P content (2.3-fold) using compound A-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No increase in <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> levels was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data demonstrated that these compounds were more potent inhibitors on G-6-Pase obtained from pig microsomes and were able to penetrate the microsomal membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The hepatocyte data further support the kinetic data, and are also consistent with the evoked mechanism of action </plain></SENT>
