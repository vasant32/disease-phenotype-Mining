<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Statistical comparisons were implemented based on phenotypic outcome characteristics of the animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used weighted vote-based supervised analytical methods to find genes whose expression can classify samples based on the presence or absence of <z:mp ids='MP_0011353'>mesangial matrix expansion</z:mp>, the best indicator for the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal disease</z:hpo> in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We identified <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35350">hydroxysteroid</z:chebi> dehydrogenase-3beta isotype 4 and osteopontin as lead classifier genes in relation to the <z:mp ids='MP_0011353'>mesangial matrix expansion</z:mp> phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used the expression levels of these genes in the kidney to classify a separate group of animals for the absence or presence of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100820'>glomerulopathy</z:hpo> with a high degree of precision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis of murine and human diabetic kidney samples showed that both markers were expressed in podocytes in the glomeruli and followed regulation similar to that observed in the microarray </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The application of phenotype-based statistical modeling approaches has led to the identification of new markers for the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011881" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic kidney disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
