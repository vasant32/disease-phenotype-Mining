<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Indeed, AMPK has been identified as an attractive target for the development of innovative molecules to treat type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this issue of Diabetologia (doi: 10.1007/s00125-011-2366-3 ), Huang and co-workers report that arctigenin activates muscle uptake of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and inhibits hepatocyte gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis by reducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> respiration and inducing AMPK activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Importantly, it is reported that arctigenin improves <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism in ob/ob mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on this evidence, Huang and co-workers suggest that arctigenin may represent a valuable lead compound for developing innovative <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While these findings are not entirely novel and mechanistic investigations are needed, the results strongly support the concept that arctigenin deserves to be further considered because of its several potentially beneficial in vivo effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In particular, the authors conclude that further mechanistic studies on arctigenin might provide novel insight and opportunities for selective modulation of subcutaneous and visceral fat mass </plain></SENT>
