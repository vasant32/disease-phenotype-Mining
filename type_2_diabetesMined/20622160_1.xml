<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using data from the European Prospective Investigation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> (EPIC)-Norfolk cohort with repeat HbA(1c) measurements, we estimated the prevalence of known and previously undiagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at baseline (baseline HbA(1c) ≥6.5%) and the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> over 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also examined the incidence and corresponding odds ratios (ORs) by different levels of baseline HbA(1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was defined clinically (self-report at follow-up, prescribed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> medication, or inclusion on a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> register) or biochemically (HbA(1c) ≥6.5% at the second health assessment), or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 4.7%; 41% of prevalent cases were previously undiagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among 5,735 participants without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at baseline (identified clinically or using HbA(1c) criteria, or both), 72 developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> over 3 years (1.3% [95% CI 1.0-1.5]), of which 49% were identified using the HbA(1c) criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 6% of the total population, the baseline HbA(1c) was 6.0-6.4%; 36% of incident cases arose in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in this group was 15 times higher than in those with a baseline HbA(1c) of &lt;5.0% (OR 15.5 [95% CI 7.2-33.3]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The cumulative incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> defined using a newly proposed HbA(1c) threshold in this middle-aged British cohort was 1.3% over 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Targeting interventions to individuals with an HbA(1c) of 6.0-6.4% might represent a feasible preventive strategy, although complementary population-based preventive strategies are also needed to reduce the growing burden of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
