<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Because of other competing priorities, physical activity (PA) is seldom addressed in a consistent way in either primary care or <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This 8-week pilot study evaluated the short-term benefits of an Internet-based supplement to usual care that focused on providing support for sedentary patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> to increase their PA levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 78 type 2 diabetic patients (53% female, average age 52.3 years) were randomized to the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Network (D-Net) Active Lives PA Intervention or an Internet information-only condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The intervention condition received goal-setting and personalized feedback, identified and developed strategies to overcome barriers, received and could post messages to an on-line "personal coach," and were invited to participate in peer group support areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Key outcomes included minutes of PA per week and depressive symptomatology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was an overall moderate improvement in PA levels within both intervention and control conditions, but there was no significant improvement in regard to condition effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was substantial variability in both site use and outcomes within the intervention and control conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Internal analyses revealed that among intervention participants, those who used the site more regularly derived significantly greater benefits, whereas those in the control condition derived no similar benefits with increased program use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Internet-based self-management interventions for PA and other regimen areas have great potential to enhance the care of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that greater attention should be focused on methods to sustain involvement with Internet-based intervention health promotion programs over time </plain></SENT>
