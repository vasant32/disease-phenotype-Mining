<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of DPP-IV inhibition by PF-00734200, a potent competitive DPP-IV inhibitor, on the dynamics of DPP-IV activity and glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) kinetics in healthy adult subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a prospective randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled, ascending, single, oral dose study conducted at a clinical research centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven healthy adult subjects were randomized to receive placebo or PF-00734200 with doses ranging from 0.3 to 300 mg (n = 9 per dose group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic end points (DPP-IV activity and GLP-1) were measured prior to, and various times after, dosing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PF-00734200 was well tolerated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pharmacokinetics (PK) data indicate that the drug was rapidly absorbed and declined in a biphasic fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean maximum concentration and area under concentration curve appeared to increase with doses proportionally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DPP-IV inhibition increased with PF-00734200 concentrations, which can be described by an E(max) model with EC50 approximately being 14 ng/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DPP-IV inhibition led to greater GLP-1 level accumulation compared with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Plasma GLP-1 levels stimulated by meals were augmented by DPP-IV inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the increase in GLP-1 with DPP-IV inhibition was non-linear and maximized at 10 mg, a dose which resulted in about 75% weighted average DPP-IV inhibition over 24 h and a 2.3-fold increase in GLP-1 over placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Moreover, even with near complete inhibition of DPP-IV for over 24 h at the highest PF-00734200 dose levels, the GLP-1 levels actually declined during the night compared with postdinner levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: DPP-IV inhibition by PF-00734200 resulted in a non-linear increase in plasma GLP-1 level, suggesting GLP-1 levels may be limited by meal stimulus or by production capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In addition, GLP-1 level declined even during maximal DPP-IV inhibition, suggesting that there may be additional pathways of GLP-1 elimination other than DPP-IV enzymatic breakdown </plain></SENT>
