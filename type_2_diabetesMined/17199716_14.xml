<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A 9-month, open-label, multicentre, observational study, with an optional 20-month extension phase, in which add-on insulin glargine therapy was initiated in 12,216 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> inadequately controlled on OADs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The insulin glargine dose was adjusted at the physician's discretion, reflecting everyday practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The main outcome measures were changes in HbA(1c), fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FBG), insulin dose and body mass index (BMI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, mean (+/- s.d.) age was 63.9 +/- 11.3 years; disease duration was &gt;5 years in 47% of patients, 1-5 years in 39% of patients and &lt;1 year in 10% of patients, while 4% of patients were newly diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Addition of insulin glargine to OAD therapy led to reductions in mean HbA(1c) (-1.5% from 8.7%) and FBG (-69 mg/dl from 202 mg/dl) levels after 3 months, which were maintained after 9 months [HbA(1c): -1.7%; FBG: -71 mg/dl (-3.9 mmol/l)] without an increase in BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similar glycaemic control was observed after 20 months in the 2721 patients in the extension study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adverse drug reactions were documented in 26 patients (0.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of 47 adverse events documented, 19 were due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In everyday practice, patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who are inadequately controlled on OADs benefit from add-on basal insulin treatment with insulin glargine as they demonstrate improved glycaemic control without <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
