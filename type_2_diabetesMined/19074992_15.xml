<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a community-based cross-sectional study involving 10 general practices; 1,035 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were studied: 421 of South Asian and 614 of white European ethnicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, sight-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0730362" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">maculopathy</z:e>, and previous laser photocoagulation therapy were assessed after grading of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> photographs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data were collected on risk factors including age, duration, and treatment of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, blood pressures, serum total cholesterol, and A1C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients of South Asian ethnicity had significantly higher systolic (144 vs. 137 mmHg, P &lt; 0.0001) and diastolic (84 vs. 74 mmHg, P &lt; 0.0001) blood pressure, A1C (7.9 vs. 7.5%, P &lt; 0.0001), and total cholesterol (4.5 vs. 4.2 mmol/l, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> was detected in 414 (40%) patients (189 South Asian [45%] versus 225 white European [37%]; P = 0.0078) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sight-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> was detected in 142 (14%) patients (68 South Asian [16%] versus 74 white European [12%]; P = 0.0597) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for confounders, there were significantly elevated risks of any <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0730362" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">maculopathy</z:e> for South Asian versus white European patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients of South Asian ethnicity had a significantly higher prevalence of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0730362" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">maculopathy</z:e>, with significantly elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure, A1C, and total cholesterol; lower attained age; and younger age at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Earlier <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of disease and higher levels of modifiable risk factors make early detection of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, annual referral for <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> screening, and intensive risk factor control key elements in addressing this health inequality </plain></SENT>
