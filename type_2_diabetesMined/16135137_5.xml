<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the potential non-invasive delivery options, pulmonary delivery is the most clinically viable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Early studies demonstrate that the inhaled insulin is rapidly absorbed and is closer to biological insulin than standard subcutaneous insulin (SC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To date, inhaled insulin (Exubera) has been clinically assessed in more than 3500 patients with type 1 or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, some treated for more than 7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Several phase 3 studies of 24-week duration have demonstrated comparable glycosylated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA1c) control in patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treated with Exubera vs. SC insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similar results have also been recorded in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, Exubera has shown clinical superiority to oral agent regimens in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who failed to achieve their target HbA1c using lifestyle modification and oral agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Exubera was well tolerated and treatment satisfaction was high, with Exubera being the preferred insulin therapy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results of these trials, and others, suggest that Exubera may be a valuable tool to help a wide variety of patients with type 1 or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> reach their recommended goals for glycaemic control, irrespective of their current therapy </plain></SENT>
