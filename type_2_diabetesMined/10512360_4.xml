<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is characterized by islet amyloid deposits, which are primarily composed of the amyloidogenic human form of islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (IAPP, amylin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of islet amyloido-genesis is not known, but other products (e.g., <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E and perlecan) contained within islet amyloid may be necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because rodent IAPP does not form islet amyloid, the currently available beta-cell lines are not useful for studying processes involved in amyloid formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To develop a suitable in vitro cell system for the study of islet amyloid formation, we generated two new beta-cell lines that express the amyloidogenic human IAPP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We did this by crossbreeding human IAPP transgenic mice with RIP-Tag mice that develop islet <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and then culturing one of these islet <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> from two separate offspring of this cross </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The resultant 2350-2C0 and 2511 cell lines produce human as well as mouse IAPP-like immunoreactivity (IAPP-LI) and immunoreactive insulin (IRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Incubation of both these cell lines with 16.7 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> resulted in a two- to fourfold increase in human IAPP-LI, mouse IAPP-LI, and IRI secretion compared with 1.67 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and the combination of 16.7 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and 10 mmol/l arginine, 0.1 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34795,48518">3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34795,48518">IBMX</z:chebi>), and 5 micromol/l <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3385">carbachol</z:chebi> induced a &gt;50-fold increase in the release of these <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The omission of calcium from the above secretagogue cocktail reduced secretion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> to only two- to sixfold higher than the 16.7 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Perifusion with 16.7 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> plus 0.1 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34795,48518">IBMX</z:chebi> caused a biphasic secretion of human IAPP-LI and mouse IAPP-LI, as well as IRI, in both cell lines, with the peak of the first phase being five- to sixfold higher than the prestimulated 1.67 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Immunoelectron microscopic inspection of both 2350-2C0 and 2511 cells after 7 days of culture did not reveal the presence of amyloid fibrils, suggesting the need for other critical components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that we have established two novel beta-cell lines that produce and secrete human IAPP in a regulated manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These cell lines will be a useful tool to investigate the secretion of human IAPP as well as the necessity of other components for islet amyloid formation </plain></SENT>
