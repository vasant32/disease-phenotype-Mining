<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There are different studies about the efficacy and safety and tolerability of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> added to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The reported improved glycemic control with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> use seems to be associated with an increase in weight with an estimated 2-3 kg <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> suggesting that maybe <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> are not safe for the clinical use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Other authors reported that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> give an improvement in the glycemic without giving <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With our review, we want to evaluate the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> combination in diabetic patients on the body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From the data emerged from our review we can conclude that even if a small increase in mean body weight was observed in patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> therapy, the <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> was less than previously reported and it was also considerably less than what might have been expected given the large improvements in glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For these reasons we can safely say that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> are effective and well tolerated in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
