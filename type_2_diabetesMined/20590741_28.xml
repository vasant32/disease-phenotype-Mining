<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>New compounds have been developed for improving <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced insulin secretion and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control, without inducing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> or <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dipeptidylpeptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors are new oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering agents, so-called incretin enhancers, which may be used as monotherapy or in combination with other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> compounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">Sitagliptin</z:chebi>, vildaglipin and saxagliptin are already on the market in many countries, either as single agents or in fixed-dose combined formulations with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other DPP-4 inhibitors, such as alogliptin and linagliptin, are currently in late phase of development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present paper summarizes and compares the main pharmacokinetics (PK) properties, that is, absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination, of these five DPP-4 inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Available data were obtained in clinical trials performed in healthy young male subjects, patients with T2DM, and patients with either <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal insufficiency</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948807" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hepatic impairment</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PK characteristics were generally similar in young healthy subjects and in middle-aged overweight patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> together gliptins have a good oral bioavailability which is not significantly influenced by food intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PK/pharmacodynamics characteristics, that is, sufficiently prolonged half-life and sustained DPP-4 enzyme inactivation, generally allow one single oral administration per day for the management of T2DM; the only exception is vildagliptin for which a twice-daily administration is recommended because of a shorter half-life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DPP-4 inhibitors are in general not substrates for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38559">cytochrome P450</z:chebi> (except saxagliptin that is metabolized via <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38559">CYP</z:chebi> 3A4/A5) and do not act as inducers or inhibitors of this system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Several metabolites have been documented but most of them are inactive; however, the main metabolite of saxagliptin also exerts a significant DPP-4 inhibition and is half as potent as the parent compound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Renal excretion is the most important elimination pathway, except for linagliptin whose metabolism in the liver appears to be predominant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>PK properties of gliptins, combined with their good safety profile, explain why no dose adjustment is necessary in elderly patients or in patients with mild to moderate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948807" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hepatic impairment</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>As far as patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal impairment</z:e> are concerned, significant increases in drug exposure for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> and saxagliptin have been reported so that appropriate reductions in daily dosages are recommended according to estimated glomerular filtration rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The PK characteristics of DPP-4 inhibitors suggest that these compounds are not exposed to a high risk of drug-drug interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However, the daily dose of saxagliptin should be reduced when coadministered with potent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38559">CYP</z:chebi> 3A4 inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, besides their pharmacodynamic properties leading to effective <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering effect without inducing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> or <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>, DPP-4 inhibitors show favourable PK properties, which contribute to a good efficacy/safety ratio for the management of T2DM in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
