<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of the current analysis was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of adding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> to the regimens of patients with <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA1C) above the International <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Federation goal (6.5%) while on MF in six European countries: Austria, Finland, Portugal, Scotland (United Kingdom), Spain and Sweden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A discrete event simulation model, which employed the United Kingdom Prospective <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study (UKPDS) Outcomes Model risk equations for predicting risks of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related complication, was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lifetime costs and benefits were projected for alternative treatment strategies of adding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi>, compared with adding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> or a SU to MF in patients not at HbA1C goal on MF monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Changes in HbA1C as well as side effects associated with these different treatment strategies were based on clinical trial data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean baseline values from local epidemiologic studies involving patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> not at HbA1C goal on MF monotherapy were included in the current analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Costs of medications, side effects and direct costs of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related complications were based on country-specific data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>UKPDS-based disutility weights associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> complications were incorporated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Disutilities associated with medication side effects were based on published data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> future costs and benefits were discounted according to local guidelines on cost-effectiveness analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One-way sensitivity analyses were conducted by varying key input parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: The discounted incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) associated with the addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> to MF, compared with adding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>, in the different countries analysed ranged from treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> being dominant (cost saving with improved health outcome) to its being cost-effective [4,766 euros per quality-adjusted life year (QALY)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> added to MF was cost-effective compared with adding a SU, with discounted ICER values ranging from 5949 euros/QALY to 20,350 euros/QALY across countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity analyses showed that these results were robust to changes in input parameters, including clinical efficacy, costs and utility weights for both <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related complications and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Compared with adding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> or a SU to MF, adding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> to MF is projected to be either cost saving or cost-effective for patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who are not at HbA1C goal on MF </plain></SENT>
