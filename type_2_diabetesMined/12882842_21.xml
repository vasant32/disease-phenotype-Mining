<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Subjects (n = 188) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and inadequate response to two oral medications (A1C &gt;8.0%) were randomly assigned to treatment with either a third oral medication or an insulin 70/30 mix b.i.d. plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> for a comparison of efficacy, safety, and cost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The protocol called for aggressive dose titration to achieve target values of fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (80-120 mg/dl), postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (&lt;160 mg/dl), and A1C (&lt;7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These efficacy parameters were evaluated at weeks 2, 6, 12, and 24 of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>If dose adjustments failed to achieve targeted glycemic control, subjects were switched to an alternate therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At the end of study (week 24 of therapy), A1C and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) values showed comparable decreases in the two treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only 31% (oral therapy) and 32% (insulin plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>) of subjects achieved target values of A1C (&lt;7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 10 of the 98 subjects randomized to triple oral therapy (10.2%) who failed to improve sufficiently were switched to insulin therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An additional four subjects dropped out of the oral treatment group due to adverse events felt to be potentially drug related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only two of the subjects randomized to insulin plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> had to be switched to basal-bolus regimens (regular insulin and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cost analysis determined that insulin plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (mean cost 3.20 dollars/day) provided efficacy equal to that of a triple oral drug regimen (10.40 dollars/day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Insulin 70/30 mix plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> was as effective as triple oral therapy in lowering A1C and FPG values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The triple oral regimen was not as cost effective, and a high percentage of subjects (total of 16.3%) did not complete this regimen due to lack of efficacy or side effects </plain></SENT>
