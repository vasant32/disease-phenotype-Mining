<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Defective beta cell mass detectable in late fetal age precedes the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our hypothesis was that an embryonic IGF production deficiency might be involved in beta cell mass anomaly in the diabetic GK rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To test this, we evaluated during pancreatic organogenesis: (1) the beta cell development in GK rats on embryonic day (E) 13.5 and E18.5; (2) IGF2 and IGF1 receptor (IGF1R) pancreatic protein production on E13.5 and E18.5; (3) the in vitro development of GK pancreatic rudiment on E13.5; and (4) the in vitro effect of IGF2 addition on beta cell mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Beta cell quantitative analyses were determined by immunohistochemistry and morphometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IGF2 and IGF1R pancreatic protein production was evaluated using western blot analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Dorsal pancreatic rudiments were dissected on E13.5, separated from surrounding mesenchyme and cultured for 7 days without or with recombinant IGF2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: While beta cell mass was already decreased on E18.5, the differentiation of the first beta cells was in fact <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in E13.5 GK pancreas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, defective IGF2 and IGF1R protein production was detected in GK pancreatic rudiment as early as E13.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The isolated GK pancreatic rudiment as maintained in vitro mimics the GK beta cell deficiency observed in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This last approach enabled us to show that GK beta cells were fully responsive to IGF2 as far as their net growth is concerned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In diabetic GK rat, defective IGF2 and IGF1R protein production in embryonic pancreas precedes beta cell mass anomaly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>IGF2 supplementation expands the pool of beta cells </plain></SENT>
