<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUs are now known also to activate cAMP sensor Epac2 (cAMP-GEFII) to Rap1 signalling, which promotes insulin granule exocytosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For SUs to exert their full effects in insulin secretion, they are required to activate Epac2 as well as to inhibit the β-cell K(ATP) channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As Epac2 is also necessary for potentiation of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced insulin secretion by cAMP-increasing agents, such as incretin, Epac2 is a target of both cAMP and SUs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The distinct effects of various SUs appear to be because of their different actions on Epac2/Rap1 signalling as well as K(ATP) channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Differently from other SUs, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi> is unique in that it is specific for β-cell K(ATP) channel and does not activate Epac2 </plain></SENT>
