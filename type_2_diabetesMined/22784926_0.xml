<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Secondary aim: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e>, treatment intensification, health service utilisation, treatment barriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 99 Asia-Pacific GPs were cluster-randomised to be educated on regional <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> management guidelines (intervention) or continue standard care (control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The intervention employed meetings, reminders, medical record summary sheets and patient result cards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each GP recruited four type 2 diabetic patients, assessed at baseline, 6 and 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was mean change in HbA1c from 0 to 6 months in patients with baseline HbA1c≥6.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 361 patients (93%) completed 6 month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The primary HbA1c outcome was -0.11% (95% CI -0.27, 0.05) with intervention and -0.22% (95% CI -0.39, -0.05) in the control group (p=0.340) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The groups did not differ in control of other glycaemic indices, blood pressure or <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> after 6 or 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In those with HbA1c≥9.0%, approximately 50% received intensified treatment by 6 months, and 30% in the final 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>GPs identified treatment costs and patient reluctance to use insulin as management barriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: A structured GP education programme did not improve HbA1c in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
