<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathogenic background of this phenomenon is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on recent findings, we hypothesized that intake of purified insoluble oat fiber may improve whole-body insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A randomized, controlled, single-blind, cross-over study was performed, and 17 overweight or <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After consumption of nine macronutrient-matched portions of fiber-enriched bread (white bread enriched with 31.2 g insoluble fiber/day) or control (white bread) over a time period of 72 h, whole-body insulin sensitivity was assessed by euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Energy intake was individually adjusted by providing standardized liquid meals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hydrogen breath tests were performed to control for dietary adherence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: When analyzing the entire cohort, whole-body <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal was improved after fiber consumption (M value 6.56 +/- 0.32 vs. 6.07 +/- 0.27 mg  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>min(-1)  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>kg(-1); P = 0.043) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thirteen subjects had increased hydrogen breath test concentrations after fiber consumption, indicating probable dietary adherence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Restricting analysis to these subjects, improvements in M value (6.85 +/- 0.34 vs. 6.06 +/- 0.32 mg  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>min(-1)  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>kg(-1); P = 0.003) and insulin sensitivity, expressed as M/I ratio (M value divided by mean serum insulin at steady state: 3.73 +/- 0.23 vs. 3.21 +/- 0.27; P = 0.02), after fiber consumption were more pronounced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, serum <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi>, ghrelin, and adiponectin concentrations, as well as substrate utilization and body weight, were not significantly changed by fiber intake (P &gt; 0.15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Increased insoluble dietary fiber intake for 3 days significantly improved whole-body insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>These data suggest a potential mechanism linking cereal fiber intake and reduced risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
