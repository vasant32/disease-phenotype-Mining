<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objectives of this study were to determine cross-sectional and prospective associations of adiponectin concentration with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e>, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) risk factors in a population-based study of Native Canadians, a group experiencing dramatic increases in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: During the 1993-1995 baseline survey, samples for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, adiponectin, and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> were collected after an overnight fast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Waist circumference and percent body fat were measured, and a 75-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test was administered: n = 505 with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (NGT), 74 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT), and 149 with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 1998, 95 high-risk subjects, defined as those who, at baseline, had either IGT or NGT with an elevated 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration (&gt;/==" BORDER="0"&gt;7.0 mmol/l), participated in a follow-up examination using the protocol used at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After adjustment for covariates including percent body fat and homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-IR), adiponectin concentrations were significantly lower among men versus women (10.8 vs. 15.0 micro g/ml, P &lt; 0.0001) and among diabetic versus NGT subjects (11.1 vs. 13.1 micro g/ml, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adiponectin was inversely correlated with percent body fat, waist circumference, HOMA-IR, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> and positively correlated with <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> (r = |0.30|-|0.44|, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariate linear regression analysis in nondiabetic subjects, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> and percent body fat were significantly related to adiponectin variation among both men and women (R(2) = 28-29%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Factor analysis returned three underlying factors among these variables, with adiponectin loading on the second factor along with insulin, waist circumference, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the follow-up study, higher adiponectin at baseline was significantly associated with increases in <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> (r = 0.24, P = 0.03) and decreases in HOMA-IR (r = -0.29, P = 0.009) after adjustment for covariates, including age, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> status at baseline and follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These population-based findings support the hypothesis that low circulating levels of adiponectin are an important determinant of risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
