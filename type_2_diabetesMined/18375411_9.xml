<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis including 44,893 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (51% women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>End points included uncontrolled <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk factors (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> &gt; or =130 mg/dl, systolic blood pressure [SBP] &gt; or =140 mmHg, and A1C &gt; or =8%) and the intensity of medical management in patients with uncontrolled <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multiple-adjusted odds ratios were calculated after stratification for the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> (present in 39% of the patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> were less likely to have SBP, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, and A1C controlled and less likely to receive intensive <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Women without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> were less likely than men to have <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> controlled with no differences in SBP or A1C control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Women with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> have poorer control of important modifiable risk factors than men and receive less intensified <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering treatment </plain></SENT>
