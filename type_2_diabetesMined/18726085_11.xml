<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Even today, we still do not know how many patients sustained a long-term liver injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No system is in place to acquire that knowledge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Regarding toxicity mechanisms, controversy persists as to which ones are class effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> (TZDs) and which are unique to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study aims to provide long-term outcome data and new insights on mechanisms of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi>-induced liver injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This case series reports the liver injuries sustained by eleven type 2 diabetic patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> between 1997 and 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Exhaustive review of medical records was performed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Long-term outcomes were available for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the non-fatal cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A comprehensive literature review was also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Long-term liver injury progressing to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> was identified in seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> eleven cases had liver injury patterns consistent with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Analysis of these cases and of the experimental <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> toxicity data points to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> toxicity as a central factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The general clinical patterns of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> hepatotoxic events are reviewed, as are the implications for other members of the TZD family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: This analysis enables the liver injury induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> to be better understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In future cases of delayed drug-induced liver injury that progresses after discontinuation, the possibility of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> toxicity should be considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>When appropriate, this can then be evaluated experimentally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Such proactive investigation may anticipate clinical risk before a large-scale therapeutic misadventure occurs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Drug-induced liver injury due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> hepatotoxins may be less unpredictable than has previously been surmised </plain></SENT>
