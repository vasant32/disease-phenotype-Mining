<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Outpatients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 146) completed a self-administered questionnaire supported by a semistructured interview based on a literature review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The content, factor, and concurrent validity and internal consistency and reproducibility of the scale were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pearson's correlation coefficients for the ES-SMBPA-2D and International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) subscale scores were calculated to evaluate the concurrent validity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The ES-SMBPA-2D was divided into two parts, the first dealing with self-management behavior to enhance physical activity in daily life and the second with behavior to maintain the level of physical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Factor analysis showed that the first part comprised four factors and the second five </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ES-SMBPA-2D correlated with the IPAQ subscales </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cronbach's alpha coefficient was between 0.56 and 0.90, and the intraclass test-retest correlation coefficient of the subscales was between 0.60 and 0.88 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The ES-SMBPA-2D is reasonably reliable and valid and is expected to prove useful for the assessment of patients' self-management behavior and for individualized instruction </plain></SENT>
