<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Islet reactive T cells and autoantibodies have been demonstrated in type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, whereas islet <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> has been limited to islet autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated whether islet reactive T cells might also be present in type 2 diabetic patients and how islet reactive T cells correlate with Î²-cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Adult phenotypic type 2 diabetic patients (n = 36) were screened for islet reactive T-cell responses using cellular immunoblotting and five islet autoantibodies (islet cell antibody, GADA, insulin autoantibody, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021670" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">insulinoma</z:e>-associated protein-2 autoantibody, and zinc transporter autoantibody) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified four subgroups of adult phenotypic type 2 diabetic patients based on their immunological status (Ab(-)T(-), Ab(+)T(-), Ab(-)T(+), and Ab(+)T(+)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Ab(-)T(+) type 2 diabetic patients demonstrated T-cell responses similar to those of the Ab(+)T(+) type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data were adjusted for BMI, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, and duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant differences (P &lt; 0.02) were observed among groups for fasting and glucagon-stimulated C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>T-cell responses to islet proteins were also demonstrated to fluctuate less than autoantibody responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We have identified a group of adult autoimmune phenotypic type 2 diabetic patients who are Ab(-)T(+) and thus would not be detected using autoantibody testing alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that islet <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> may be more prevalent in adult phenotypic type 2 diabetic patients than previously estimated </plain></SENT>
