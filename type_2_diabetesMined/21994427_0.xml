<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Using a mouse model for human-like <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> metabolism, we observed previously that reduction of the hepatic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> (TG) content resulted in a decrease in plasma cholesteryl <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> transfer protein (CETP) and an increase in <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the current study was to investigate the effects of prolonged caloric restriction in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, resulting in a major reduction in hepatic TG content, on plasma CETP and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 27 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (BMI: 37.2 ± 0.9 kg/m(2)) insulin-dependent patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (14 men and 13 women, aged 55 ± 2 years) who received a 16-week very low calorie diet (VLCD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At baseline and after a 16-week VLCD, plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi>, and CETP were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, functionality of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> with respect to inducing cholesterol efflux from human monocyte cells (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1) was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A 16-week VLCD markedly decreased plasma CETP concentration (-18%; P &lt; 0.01) and increased plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> (apo)AI levels (+16%; P &lt; 0.05), without significantly affecting plasma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although a VLCD results in <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> that is less lipidated, the functionality of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> with respect to inducing cholesterol efflux in vitro was unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The marked decrease in hepatic TG content induced by a 16-week VLCD is accompanied by a decrease in plasma CETP concentration and an increase in apoAI levels, without improving the cholesterol efflux properties of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> in vitro </plain></SENT>
