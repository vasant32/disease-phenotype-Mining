<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to assess the long-term relationship between sleep duration and the incidence of clinical <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A cohort of men from the Massachusetts Male Aging Study without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at baseline (1987-1989) were followed until 2004 for the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Average number of hours of sleep per night was grouped into the following categories: &lt; or =5, 6, 7, 8, and &gt;8 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Incidence rates and relative risks (RRs) were calculated for the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in each sleep duration category </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Those reporting 7 h of sleep per night served as the reference group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis was performed using Poisson regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Men reporting short sleep duration (&lt; or =5 and 6 h of sleep per night) were twice as likely to develop <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and men reporting long sleep duration (&gt;8 h of sleep per night) were more than three times as likely to develop <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> over the period of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Elevated risks remained essentially unchanged after adjustment for age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, smoking status, self-rated health status, education, and waist circumference (RR 1.95 [95% CI 0.95-4.01] for &lt; or =5 h and 3.12 [1.53-6.37] for &gt;8 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RRs were altered considerably for the two extreme sleep groups when adjusted for <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> (1.51 [0.71-3.19] for &lt; or =5 h and 2.81 [1.34-5.90] for &gt;8 h), suggesting that the effects of sleep on <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> could be mediated via changes in endogenous <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Short and long sleep durations increase the risk of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, independent of confounding factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Sleep duration may represent a novel risk factor for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
