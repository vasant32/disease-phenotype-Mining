<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A 12-week, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study comparing vildagliptin (50 mg q.d.) and placebo was conducted in 179 subjects with IGT (2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> 9.1 mmol/l, A1C 5.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasma levels of intact glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> 1 (GLP-1) and gastric inhibitory <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (GIP), <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, and glucagon were measured during standard meal tests performed at baseline and at week 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Insulin secretory rate (ISR) was estimated by C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> deconvolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The between-group differences (vildagliptin - placebo) in the adjusted mean changes from baseline to end point in the total and incremental (Delta) area under the curve (AUC)(0-2 h) for these analytes were assessed by ANCOVA; <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> AUC(0-2 h) was the primary outcome variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Relative to placebo, vildagliptin increased GLP-1 (DeltaAUC, +6.0 +/- 1.2 pmol x l(-1) x h(-1), P &lt; 0.001) and GIP (DeltaAUC, +46.8 +/- 5.4 pmol  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>l(-1) x h(-1), P &lt; 0.001) and decreased glucagon (DeltaAUC, -3.0 +/- 1.0 pmol x l(-1) x h(-1), P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although postprandial insulin levels were unaffected (DeltaAUC, +20.8 +/- 35.7 pmol x l(-1) x h(-1), P = 0.561), prandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excursions were reduced (DeltaAUC, -1.0 +/- 0.3 mmol x l(-1) x h(-1), P &lt; 0.001), representing an approximately 30% decrease relative to placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Beta-cell function as assessed by the ISR AUC(0-2 h)/<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> AUC(0-2 h) was significantly increased (+6.4 +/- 2.0 pmol x min(-1) x m(-2) x mmol x l(-1), P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Adverse event profiles were similar in the two treatment groups, and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> was reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The known effects of vildagliptin on incretin levels and islet function in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were reproduced in subjects with IGT, with a 32% reduction in postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excursions and no evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
