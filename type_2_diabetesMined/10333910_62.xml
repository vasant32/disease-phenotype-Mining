<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) demonstrated the powerful impact of glycemic control on the early manifestations of microvascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Contemporary prospective data on the evolution of macrovascular and late microvascular complications of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Epidemiology of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Interventions and Complications (EDIC) study is a multicenter, longitudinal, observational study designed to use the well-characterized DCCT cohort of &gt; 1,400 patients to determine the long-term effects of prior separation of glycemic levels on micro- and macrovascular outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using a standardized annual history and physical examination, 28 EDIC clinical centers that were DCCT clinics will follow the EDIC cohort for 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Annual evaluation also includes resting electrocardiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Doppler ultrasound measurements of ankle/arm blood pressure, and screening for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At regular intervals, a timed 4-h urine is collected, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profiles are obtained, and stereoscopic fundus photographs are taken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, dual B-mode Doppler ultrasound scans of the common and internal carotid arteries will be performed at years 1 and 6 and at study end </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Written informed consent was obtained from 96% of the DCCT subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The participants, compared with nonparticipants, tended to have better glycemic control at the completion of the DCCT and were more likely to have their <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care provided by DCCT personnel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The EDIC baseline measurement stratified by sex delineates multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> risk factor differences such as age (older in men), waist-to-hip ratio (higher in men) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (lower in men), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (more prevalent in men), and maximum intimal-medial thickness of common and internal carotid arteries (thicker in men) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Of the original conventional treatment group, 69% have changed to continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion or multiple daily injections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although the mean HbA1c difference between the intensive and conventional treatment groups narrowed at EDIC years 1 and 2, HbA1c remained significantly lower in the intensive group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> expected clinic visits, 95% were completed, and the quality of EDIC data is very similar to that observed in the DCCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although obvious problems exist in extended follow-up studies of completed clinical trials, these are balanced by the value of continued systematic observation of the DCCT cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In contrast to other epidemiologic studies, EDIC will provide 1) definitive data on type 1 as distinct from type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; 2) reliance on prospective rather than on cross-sectional analysis; 3) long-term follow-up in a large population; 4) consistent use of objective, reliable measures of outcomes and glycemia; and 5) observation of patients from before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of complications </plain></SENT>
