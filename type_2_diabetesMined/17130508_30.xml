<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Human erythrocytes, by virtue of their ability to release ATP in response to physiological stimuli, have been proposed to participate in the regulation of local blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A signal transduction pathway that relates these stimuli to ATP release has been described and includes the heterotrimeric G protein G(i) and adenylyl cyclase (AC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this cell, G(i) activation results in increases in cAMP and, ultimately, ATP release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that G(i) expression is decreased in animal models of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and in platelets of humans with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we report that G(i2) expression is selectively decreased in erythrocytes of humans with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and that this defect is associated with reductions in cAMP accumulation and ATP release in response to incubation of erythrocytes with mastoparan 7 (10 micromol/l), an activator of G(i) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Importantly, this defect in ATP release correlates inversely with the adequacy of glycemic control as determined by levels of HbA(1c) (A1C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that in erythrocytes of humans with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, both G(i) expression and ATP release in response to mastoparan 7 are impaired, which is consistent with the hypothesis that this defect in erythrocyte <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> could contribute to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> associated with this clinical condition </plain></SENT>
