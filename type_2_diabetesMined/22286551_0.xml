<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-one healthy <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-tolerant first-degree relatives of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> underwent a 75 g OGTT, an isoglycaemic i.v. <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> test and a mixed meal to evaluate the incretin effect before and after treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> to increase <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Beta cell <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> sensitivity, beta cell index and fasting proinsulin were measured as indices of beta cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi>, ten individuals had increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> but <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (NGT), while 11 individuals with an equal increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> developed IGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the NGT and IGT groups, the incretin effects were 71 ± 3.2% and 67 ± 4.6% (p = 0.4) before treatment, but decreased significantly in both groups to 58 ± 5.2% and 32 ± 8.8% (p &lt; 0.05 between groups) after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">Dexamethasone</z:chebi> increased total glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent insulinotropic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> responses to the OGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The impaired incretin effect in NGT was observed in the absence of reductions in beta cell <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> sensitivity and beta cell index during i.v. <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, corrected for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, but in parallel with increased proinsulin/C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo> and IGT, representing two stages in the path towards <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, are associated with differential reductions in the incretin effect seen before the development of IGT and overt type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The reduction is unrelated to secretion of incretin hormones, but is related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and subtle beta cell defects, and is further aggravated on development of IGT </plain></SENT>
