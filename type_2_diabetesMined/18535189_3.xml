<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Participants were 1,709 individuals from western New York: 257 women and men with incident MI and 1,452 healthy control subjects (aged 35-70 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">Lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation was measured by plasma levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33202">thiobarbituric acid</z:chebi> reactive substances (TBARS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>History of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was determined by self-reported history of medical diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In multivariate analyses, there was no significant difference in TBARS levels between case and control subjects in both sexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In subgroup analyses by <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> status, diabetic subjects, regardless of MI status, exhibited significantly higher TBARS values than nondiabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For diabetic women, TBARS values were 1.84 and 1.83 nmol/ml for case and control subjects, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Values for nondiabetic women were 1.29 and 1.31 nmol/ml, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In diabetic men, values were 1.65 and 1.97 nmol/ml for case and control subjects, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Values for nondiabetic men were 1.36 and 1.36 nmol/ml, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Whereas type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may be an important correlate of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation, clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> may not </plain></SENT>
