<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: We evaluated the use and annual cost of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) compared to conventional medicine in type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM) in the Korean population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed the database of 2752 DM patients obtained from the Korean National <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Program (KNDP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cost data of conventional medicine starting 1-year before enrolment of the KNDP were obtained from the hospital electronic database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cost data of CAM over the same period were obtained from questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 2752 subjects, 677 patients (24.6%) used CAM, with the most common type being red ginseng and herbal medicine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with a higher income, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e>, and self-monitoring of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (SMBG) were more likely to use CAM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Men, those with a higher education level and income, no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi>) history, and SMBG showed a relatively higher cost of CAM of total medical cost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The independent predictors for CAM were a higher income, the existence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011882" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic neuropathy</z:e>, no <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi> history, and SMBG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Use and cost of CAM varied depending on income, accompanying complications and SMBG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the total medical costs in DM patients, a comprehensive approach considering not only conventional cost but also CAM is required </plain></SENT>
