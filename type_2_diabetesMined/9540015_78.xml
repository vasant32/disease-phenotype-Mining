<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of lifestyle intervention over 2 years on changes in weight, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> (CHD) risk factors, and incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in overweight individuals with a parental history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Participants (n = 154), who were 30-100% over ideal body weight, had one or both parents with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and were currently nondiabetic, were randomly assigned to 2-year treatments focused on diet (decreasing calories and fat intake), exercise (goal of 1,500 kcal/week of moderate activity), or the combination of diet plus exercise or to a no-treatment control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects were reassessed at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At 6 months, the groups differed significantly on measures of eating, exercise, and fitness; weight losses in the diet and diet-plus-exercise groups were significantly greater than in the exercise and control conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Weight losses were associated with positive changes in CHD risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 6 months, there was gradual deterioration of behavioral and physiological changes, so that at 2 years, almost no between-group differences were maintained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Differences between groups in risk of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were of borderline significance (P = 0.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Strongest predictors were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> at baseline, which was positively related to risk of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> from baseline to 2 years, which was negatively related; in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treatment groups, a modest <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> of 4.5 kg reduced the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by approximately 30% compared with no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although initially successful, the interventions studied here were not effective in producing long-term changes in behavior, weight, or physiological parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> from 0 to 2 years reduced the risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Since modest <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> significantly reduced risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, further research is needed to determine how best to increase the percentage of subjects achieving at least a modest <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
