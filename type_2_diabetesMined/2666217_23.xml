<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied fasting plasma C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, glucagon stimulated plasma C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, and 24 h urinary C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> in relation to clinical type of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in 132 insulin treated diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified clinically as Type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetic subjects in the presence of at least two of the following criteria: 1) significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002919'>ketonuria</z:hpo>, 2) insulin treatment started within one year after diagnosis, 3) age of diagnosis less than or equal to 40 years, and 4) weight below 110% of ideal weight of the same age and sex </plain></SENT>
