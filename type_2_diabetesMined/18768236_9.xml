<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this paper was to conduct a systematic review of T2DM complications in Indigenous populations worldwide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A literature review was conducted using PubMed and EMBASE to examine available complications data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Country, Indigenous population, authors, publication year, total sample size, Indigenous sample size, age, methodology, and prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal disease</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e>, lower extremity <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputations</z:mpath>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, hospitalizations and mortality due to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One-hundred and eleven studies were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results revealed a disproportionate burden of disease complications among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Indigenous peoples regardless of their geographic location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complication rates were seen to vary widely across Indigenous groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Gaps were found in the published literature on complications among Indigenous populations, especially those living in underdeveloped countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These gaps may be in part due to the challenges caused by varying operational practices, research methodologies, and definitions of the term Indigenous, making documentation of rates among these peoples problematic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Comprehensive surveillance applying standardized definitions and methodologies is needed to design targeted prevention and disease management strategies for Indigenous peoples with T2DM </plain></SENT>
