<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Telomeres are DNA sequences necessary for DNA replication, which shorten at cell division at a rate related to levels of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Once shortened to a critical length, cells are triggered into replicative senescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is associated with oxidative DNA damage, and we hypothesized that telomere shortening would characterize type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 21 male type 2 diabetic subjects (mean age 61.2 years, mean HbA(1c) 7.9%) selected to limit confounding effects on telomere length and 29 matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Telomere length was measured in peripheral venous monocyte and T-cells (na√Øve and memory) by fluorescent in situ hybridization and oxidative DNA damage by flow cytometry of oxidized DNA bases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (homeostasis model assessment) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean monocyte telomere length in the diabetic group was highly significantly lower than in control subjects (4.0 [1.1] vs. 5.5 [1.1]; P &lt; 0.0001), without significant differences in lymphocyte telomere length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a trend toward increased oxidative DNA damage in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> cell types examined and a significant inverse relationship between oxidative DNA damage and telomere length (r = -0.55; P = 0.018) in the diabetic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Telomere length was unrelated to plasma CRP concentration or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Monocyte telomere shortening in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> could be due to increased oxidative DNA damage to monocyte precursors during cell division </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This data suggests that monocytes adhering to vascular endothelium and entering the vessel wall in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are from a population with shorter telomeres and at increased risk of replicative senescence within vascular plaque </plain></SENT>
