<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A random sample of 204 metropolitan doctors from 124 practices was selected and an audit performed on 467 of their patient records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>GPs pursued good blood sugar control and advocated lifestyle changes before hypoglycaemic drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Over 80% regard uncomplicated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DM2</z:e> as a condition for general practice management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, only 15% conducted an annual <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> check, 9% had a diabetic register, 6% a diabetic recall system and 8% used a diabetic health care checklist for monitoring their patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most commonly recorded processes of medical audit in the previous 12 months were: blood pressure (94%), duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (72%), blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (70%), diet (66%), body weight (56%), HBA1c (52%) and ophthalmoscopy (50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The least commonly recorded processes of care were body mass index (5%), inspection of the feet (18%), enquiries about <z:mp ids='MP_0003541'>vaginitis</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000802'>impotence</z:hpo> (23%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The amount of exercise, alcohol and tobacco was recorded in only 34% of records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hypoglycaemic drugs were used appropriately but the most commonly used drugs for treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DM2</z:e> patients were <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50264">thiazide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretics</z:chebi> and beta-blockers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Vocationally registered (VR) doctors had better records, higher process of care scores and more were willing to participate in the study than non-vocationally registered (NVR) doctors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, there was no difference in metabolic control between patients from either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The use of a Diabetic Health Care Checklist would improve <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care especially in the search for early complications and in the recording of HBA1c and other metabolic parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The drugs commonly used to control <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> can have adverse effects on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism and should be replaced with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> neutral drugs </plain></SENT>
