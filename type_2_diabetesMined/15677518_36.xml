<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The role of common variation of GCK is uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A polymorphism at position -30 of the GCK beta-cell-specific promoter, present in 30% of the population, has been variably associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related quantitative traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using 1,763 U.K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Caucasian normoglycemic adult subjects, we demonstrated that the A allele at GCK(-30) is associated with a 0.06-mmol/l increase in fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) (P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The A allele was also associated with an increase in FPG in 755 women who were 28 weeks pregnant (0.075 mmol/l, P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We then went on to analyze the effect of GCK(-30) on birth weight using 2,689 mother/child pairs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of the A allele in the mother was associated with a 64-g (25-102 g) increase in offspring birth weight (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We did not detect a fetal genotype effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The increase in offspring birth weight in the 30% of mothers carrying an A allele at GCK(-30) is likely to reflect an elevated FPG during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study establishes that common genetic variation, in addition to rare mutations and environmental factors, can affect both FPG and birth weight </plain></SENT>
