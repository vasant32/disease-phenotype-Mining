<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: There is conflicting evidence regarding the utility of stress management training in the treatment of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The few studies that have shown a therapeutic effect of stress management have used time-intensive individual therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, widespread use of such interventions is not practical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present investigation is to determine whether a cost-effective, group-based stress management training program can improve <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and to determine whether a particular subset of patients is more likely to get positive results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were randomized to undergo a five-session group <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> education program with or without stress management training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Participants (n = 108) were followed for 1 year, during which HbA(1c) tests and questionnaires assessing perceived stress, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, and psychological health were administered at regular intervals to evaluate treatment effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Stress management training was associated with a small (0.5%) but significant reduction in HbA(1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compliance with the treatment regimen decreased over time but was similar to that seen in patients receiving stress management for other reasons in the clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Trait <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> (a measure of stable individual differences in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> proneness) did not predict response to treatment, showing that highly anxious patients did not derive more benefit from training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicate that a cost-effective, group stress management program in a "real-world" setting can result in clinically significant benefits for patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
