<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: FTO is the most important polygene identified for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to investigate whether a variant in FTO affects type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk entirely through its effect on BMI and how FTO influences BMI across adult life span </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Through regression models, we assessed the relationship between the FTO single nucleotide polymorphisms rs9939609, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and BMI across life span in subjects from the Norwegian population-based HUNT study using cross-sectional and longitudinal perspectives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For replication and meta-analysis, we used data from the Malmö Diet and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> (MDC) and Malmö Preventive Project (<z:chebi fb="26" ids="34761">MPP</z:chebi>) cohorts, comprising a total sample of 41,504 Scandinavians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The meta-analysis revealed a highly significant association for rs9939609 with both type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (OR 1.13; P = 4.5 × 10(-8)) and the risk to develop incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (OR 1.16; P = 3.2 × 10(-8)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The associations remained also after correction for BMI and other anthropometric measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we confirmed the strong effect on BMI (0.28 kg/m(2) per risk allele; P = 2.0 × 10(-26)), with no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> between different age-groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found no differences in change of BMI over time according to rs9939609 risk alleles, neither overall (ΔBMI = 0.0 [-0.05, 0.05]) nor in any individual age stratum, indicating no further <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> attributable to FTO genotype in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We have identified that a variant in FTO alters type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk partly independent of its observed effect on BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The additional <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> as a result of the FTO risk variant seems to occur before adulthood, and the BMI difference remains stable thereafter </plain></SENT>
