<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted from 10 January 2000 to 10 January 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It involved 30 U.S. academic medical centers, which contributed data from 44 clinics (27 primary care clinics and 17 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>/endocrinology clinics) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For 1,765 eligible adult patients with type 1 or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with at least two clinic visits in the 24 months before 10 January 2002, including one visit in the 6 months before 10 January 2002, we assessed measurement and control of HbA(1c), blood pressure, and cholesterol and corresponding medical regimen changes at the most recent clinic visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In this ethnically and economically diverse cohort, annual testing rates were very high (97.4% for HbA(1c), 96.6% for blood pressure, and 87.6% for total cholesterol) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fewer patients were at HbA(1c) goal (34.0% &lt;7.0%) or blood pressure goal (33.0% &lt;130/80 mmHg) than <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> goals (65.1% total cholesterol &lt;200 mg/dl, 46.1% with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> &lt;100 mg/dl) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only 10.0% of the cohort met recommended goals for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the most recent clinic visit, 40.4% of patients with HbA(1c) concentrations above goal underwent adjustment of their corresponding regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among untreated patients, few with elevated blood pressure (10.1% with blood pressure &gt;130/80 mmHg) or elevated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (5.6% with <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> &gt;100 mg/dl) were started on corresponding therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were no less likely to be intensified than patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High rates of risk factor testing do not necessarily translate to effective metabolic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Low rates of medication adjustment among patients with levels above goal suggest a specific and novel target for quality improvement measurement </plain></SENT>
