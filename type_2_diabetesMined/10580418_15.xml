<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the presence of anti-CD38 autoantibodies in Caucasian patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and investigated the effect of these antibodies on insulin secretion from isolated human pancreatic islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The presence of anti-CD38 autoantibodies was evaluated by using Western blot analysis in 236 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (mean age 63 years), in 160 patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (mean age 38 years), and in 159 nondiabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anti-CD38 autoantibody titers at least 3 SD above the mean value of the control group were found in 9.7% of type 2 diabetic patients and in 13.1% of type 1 diabetic patients (chi2 = 15.9, P = 0.0003 vs. 1.3% of control subjects) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were observed in sex distribution, current age, age at <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, BMI, fasting serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, or glycemic control between anti-CD38+ and anti-CD38-diabetic patients in either the type 2 or type 1 diabetic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effect of 23 anti-CD38- and 13 anti-CD38+ sera on insulin secretion at low (3.3 mmol/l) or high (16.7 mmol/l) medium <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations was evaluated in isolated human pancreatic islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data are medians (interquartile range) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The anti-CD38+ sera potentiated insulin release both at low [95 (64) vs. 23 (12) microU/ml of control incubations, respectively, P &lt; 0.0001] and high [271 (336) vs. a control of 55 (37) microU/ml, respectively, P = 0.001] medium <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations, whereas the anti-CD38- sera did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in the pooled data from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 36 tested sera, insulin levels in the islet incubation medium were directly related to the anti-CD38 antibody titer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that autoantibodies to CD38 are associated with both type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Caucasian subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These autoantibodies exert a stimulatory effect on insulin secretion by cultured human islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The role of this autoimmune reaction in the pathogenesis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> remains to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
