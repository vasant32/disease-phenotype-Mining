<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The results of autonomic symptoms, clinical parameters, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> complications and cardiovascular reflex (CVR) tests of 674 T2DM were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant correlations were found between CAN risk and age (p=0.019), duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (p=0.008), HbA1c (p&lt;0.001), systolic blood pressure (p=0.006), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> (p&lt;0.001), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (p&lt;0.001), and QTc interval (p&lt;0.001), but not BMI and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> had increase risk of CAN, and proliferative diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDR</z:e>) was the most significant risk factor (odds ratio: 6.85; 95% CI: 2.32-20.20) for CAN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eighty-three percent of patients complained of autonomic symptoms; and the more symptoms complained, the higher the prevalence of CAN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000802'>Impotence</z:hpo> was the only single symptom associated with CAN risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additional CAN risks were also observed when patients with multiple symptoms and/or complications in combinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results implied that patients with multiple symptoms and/or complications in combinations have increased CAN risk, and this may provide additional information for clinicians to identify T2DM at risk of having CAN </plain></SENT>
