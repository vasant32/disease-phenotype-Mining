<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Given the transient nature of exercise-induced improvements in insulin sensitivity, it has been speculated that daily exercise is preferred to maximize the benefits of exercise for glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The current study investigates the impact of daily exercise versus exercise performed every other day on glycemic control in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Thirty type 2 diabetic patients (age 60 ± 1 years, BMI 30.4 ± 0.7 kg/m(2), and HbA(1c) 7.2 ± 0.2%) participated in a randomized crossover experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects were studied on three occasions for 3 days under strict dietary standardization but otherwise free-living conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis was assessed by continuous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring over 48 h during which subjects performed no exercise (control) or 60 min of cycling exercise (50% maximal workload capacity) distributed either as a single session performed every other day or as 30 min of exercise performed daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> (blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &gt;10 mmol/L) was reduced from 7:40 ± 1:00 h:min per day (32 ± 4% of the time) to 5:46 ± 0:58 and 5:51 ± 0:47 h:min per day, representing 24 ± 4 and 24 ± 3% of the time, when exercise was performed either daily or every other day, respectively (P &lt; 0.001 for both treatments) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No differences were observed between the impact of daily exercise and exercise performed every other day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A short 30-min session of moderate-intensity endurance-type exercise substantially reduces the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> throughout the subsequent day in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When total work is being matched, daily exercise does not further improve daily glycemia compared with exercise performed every other day </plain></SENT>
