<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and insulin treatment on bone mineral density (BMD) in middle-aged and elderly men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We measured BMD and evaluated known determinants of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> in 56 type 1 and 68 type 2 diabetic patients and 498 nondiabetic community control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients, aged 52-72 years, developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after the age of 30 years (i.e., after achievement of peak bone mass) and were treated with insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BMD was measured at the proximal femur with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among both sexes, BMD values were significantly lower in type 1 diabetic patients than in type 2 diabetic patients or the control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When adjusted for age and BMI, the differences between type 1 diabetic patients and control subjects remained essentially unchanged in both sexes, whereas the differences between type 1 and type 2 diabetic subjects were significant only in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After further adjustments for confounding factors, the average BMD values were still lower in type 1 diabetic subjects than in type 2 diabetic subjects although with lesser significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Past low-energy fractures were more common in type 1 diabetic women than in type 2 diabetic women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The lower BMD in type 1 versus type 2 diabetic patients and control subjects probably results from more rapid bone loss after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This cannot be explained by insulin treatment, which was prescribed for both types of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Because the causes of low BMD in type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are unknown, these patients should be evaluated for the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> and related fractures and offered appropriate preventive measures </plain></SENT>
