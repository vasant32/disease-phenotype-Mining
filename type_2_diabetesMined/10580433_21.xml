<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Oral and frequently sampled intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests (OGTTs and FSIGTs), hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps with labeled <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and body composition studies were performed on 91 islet cell antibody-negative Latino women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> during the third trimester of pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The women were documented to be <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-free within 6 months postpartum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> status was ascertained again between 11 and 26 months postpartum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent predictors of the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> within that interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fourteen of the women developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by World Health Organization criteria 11-26 months after delivery of the index pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three antepartum variables were independent predictors of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>: the 1-h postchallenge plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration from the 100-g OGTT at which <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> was diagnosed (higher = increased risk; P = 0.003); an index of pancreatic beta-cell compensation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, defined as the product of the 30-min incremental plasma insulin:<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> ratio on a 75-g OGTT and the insulin sensitivity index from a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (lower = increased risk, P = 0.009); and the basal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production rate after an overnight fast (higher = increased risk; P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that postchallenge <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, poor pancreatic beta-cell compensation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, and elevated endogenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production during pregnancy precede the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in young Latino women by at least 1-2 years </plain></SENT>
