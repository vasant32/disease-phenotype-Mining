<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies were obtained before and after 150-min hyperinsulinaemic clamp (average serum insulin 250 pM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Basal adipose tissue UCP-2 mRNA levels in the FDR group were significantly lower than that in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After the hyperinsulinaemic clamp, adipose tissue UCP-2 mRNA levels were increased by 32% in the control group (p &lt; 0.05) and 32% in the FDR group (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The basal adipose tissue UCP-3 mRNA level was similar in the two groups and increased in both the groups during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020459" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperinsulinaemia</z:e> (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry showed that despite similar BMI the FDR group had significantly higher fat mass (FM) per cent compared to that of the control group (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The UCP-2 mRNA expression was inversely correlated with the amount of adipose tissue (r = -0.53, p &lt; 0.001), and multiple regression analysis revealed that only the amount of FM was independently correlated with basal UCP-2 mRNA levels, whereas age, gender nor family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> contributed independently to the variation in UCP-2 mRNA levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No differences in EE were observed between the two groups, and no association between EE and UCP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we have demonstrated that adipose tissue UCP-2 and UCP-3 mRNA levels are significantly increased during a 150-min hyperinsulinaemic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The UCP-2 mRNA levels were expressed at a significantly lower level FDR to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared to control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, in multiple regression analysis controlling for amount of adipose tissue, the difference between the two groups disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, only the amount of adipose tissue contributed independently to the variation in UCP-2 mRNA expression </plain></SENT>
