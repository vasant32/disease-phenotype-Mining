<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: The present study investigated the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> on insulin requirements and glycaemic control in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> receiving exogenous insulin due to secondary failure of maximum dose sulphonylurea therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A single-centre, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study was performed in 48 type 2 diabetic patients with late-term failure following at least 3 years of sulphonylurea therapy requiring additional insulin therapy to determine the impact of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> on glycaemic control and insulin requirements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary end points were glycaemic response rate (responders being predefined as patients who achieve a decrease in HbA1c to less than 8% or a reduction by at least 15% as compared to the baseline values) and the daily insulin dose at 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Secondary parameters assessed included postprandial changes in blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, serum insulin and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> during the treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were significantly more responders in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi>-treated group compared with the placebo group (20/24 patients vs. 10/19 patients; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean daily insulin dose after 24 weeks of treatment was 16.4 +/- 10.1 IU in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> group and 22.4 +/- 12.2 IU in the placebo group (mean +/- s.d.; p &lt; 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Postprandial increases in blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> were consistently lower in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi>-treated group than in the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For example, the mean increase in 2-h postprandial serum insulin remained almost unchanged in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> group at the end of 24 weeks of treatment compared to an increase to 43 +/- 29 microU/ml (mean +/- s.d.) at the end of the study period for the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest that the addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> to sulphonylurea/insulin combination therapy can improve glycaemic control in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">Acarbose</z:chebi> may also reduce <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020459" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperinsulinaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
