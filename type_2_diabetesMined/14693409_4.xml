<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Insulin-sensitizing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> (TZDs) decrease inflammatory markers such as high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) in sera in addition to their hypoglycemic effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, factors associated with the decrease in serum hsCRP concentrations are unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, an effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> on serum hsCRP levels was investigated and compared with its effect on glycemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 34 subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (17 men and 17 women, aged 54+/-2 years and body mass index (BMI) 26.7+/-0.6 kg/m(2), mean+/-S.E.) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nineteen out of the 34 subjects was treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> 400mg daily for 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The remaining 15 subjects were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> 750 mg daily as a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Baseline hsCRP levels were comparable between the two groups, and those were positively associated with fasting insulin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After treatment, glycemic control assessed by HbA1c and fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels improved in both groups, whereas insulin sensitivity index estimated by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-R) decreased only in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi>-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of hsCRP significantly decreased from 916+/-210 ng/ml to 569+/-123 ng/ml (P&lt;0.05) in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi>-treated group, whereas the levels remained unchanged in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>-treated group (from 1087+/-248 ng/ml to 1152+/-301 ng/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi>-treated group, there was no difference in the absolute and percent change in serum hsCRP levels between responders, who displayed the decrease in HbA1c greater than 0.6% (n=12), and the remaining non-responders (n=7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The decrease in serum hsCRP concentrations was negatively related to baseline levels of serum hsCRP and insulin and HOMA-R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi>, but not <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, reduced serum hsCRP levels in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The decrease in serum hsCRP concentrations by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> was associated with the pretreatment levels of hsCRP and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, but independent of the changes in glycemia </plain></SENT>
