<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 58 diet-treated patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (aged 54 +/- 1 years; 34 men and 24 women; BMI 31.5 +/- 0.6 kg/m(2)) were randomly assigned to receive placebo (n=11) or 7.5 mg (n=13), 15 mg (n=12), 30 mg (n=11), or 45 mg (n=11) of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> per day for 26 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Before and after 26 weeks, subjects underwent a 75-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients treated with 7.5 or 15 mg/day of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> had no change in fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) and fasting plasma insulin (FPI) concentrations or in plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (PG) and insulin concentrations during the OGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients treated with 30 and 45 mg/day of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>, respectively, had significant decreases from placebo in HbA1c (delta=-2.0 and -2.9%), FPG (delta=-66 and -97 mg/dl), and mean PG during OGTT (delta=-84 and -107 mg/dl) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fasting plasma insulin decreased significantly in the 45-mg/day <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> group, but the mean plasma insulin during the OGTT did not change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The insulinogenic index (delta area under the curve [AUC] insulin/deltaAUC <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>) during the OGTT increased significantly in the 30- and 45-mg/day <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> groups (0.13 +/- 0.03 to 0.27 +/- 0.05, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>From the OGTT, we previously have derived a composite whole-body insulin sensitivity index (ISI) that correlates well with that measured directly with the insulin clamp technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Whole-body ISI [ISI=10,000/(square-root (FPG x FPI) x (PG x PI)) where PG and PI equal mean plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin concentrations during OGTT] increased significantly in patients treated with 30 mg (1.8 +/- 0.3 to 2.5 +/- 0.3, P &lt; 0.05) or 45 mg (1.6 +/- 0.2 to 2.7 +/- 0.6, P &lt; 0.05) per day of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the basal state, the hepatic ISI [k/(FPG x FPI)[k/(FPG x FPI)], which agrees closely with that measured directly with tritiated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, increased in patients treated with 30 mg (0.13 +/- 0.02 to 0.21 +/- 0.03, P &lt; 0.05) and 45 mg (0.11 +/- 0.02 to 0.24 +/- 0.06, P &lt; 0.05) per day of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Significant correlations between the dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> and the changes in HbA1c (r=-0.58), FPG (r=-0.47), mean PG during the OGTT (r=-0.46), insulinogenic index (r=0.34), hepatic ISI (r=0.44), and whole-body ISI (r=0.36) were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">Pioglitazone</z:chebi> improves glycemic control through the dose-dependent enhancement of beta-cell function and improved whole-body and hepatic insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
