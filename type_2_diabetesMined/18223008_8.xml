<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genetic variants in the UCP2-UCP3 gene cluster, located on chromosome 11q13, may play a significant role in the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive assessment of common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the 70-kb UCP2-UCP3 gene cluster in relation to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk in a prospective, case-control study nested in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study, an ethnically diverse cohort of postmenopausal women including Caucasian, African, Hispanic, and Asian American subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We genotyped 14 tag SNPs in 1,584 incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> case and 2,198 control subjects matched by age, ethnicity, clinical center, time of blood draw, and length of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified a haplotype set (rs591758-rs668514- rs647126-rs1800006, spanning the UCP2-UCP3 intergenic and UCP3 regions) as significantly associated with greater type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk (nominal P = 0.0011, permutation P = 0.046) in Caucasian women, especially among overweight Caucasians (BMI &gt;25 kg/m(2)) (nominal P = 0.0006, permutation P = 0.032) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with the most common haplotype (h1010 as the referent), haplotype h0001 (19.5% in control subjects) had odds ratios of 2.0 (95% CI 1.13-3.37) in Caucasians and 3.8 (1.44-9.93) in Caucasian overweight women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similar haplotype-type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> association was also observed among Hispanic women who were overweight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a role of UCP2-UCP3 gene cluster haplotypes in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; in particular, the effects of the high-risk haplotypes were more apparent in overweight Caucasian women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data warrant further confirmation in future prospective and experimental studies </plain></SENT>
