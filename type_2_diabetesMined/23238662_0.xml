<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The association attenuated when adjusting for parameters of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism (fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, fasting insulin, HbA(1c), and 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>; OR 1.16 [0.95-1.42], P = 0.15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Similar analyses for high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) yielded the following ORs: 1.39 (1.10-1.68, P = 0.0006) and 1.13 (0.88-1.45, P = 0.34), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, A-SAA concentrations were significantly associated with 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels at follow-up even after adjustment for parameters of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism (P = 0.008, n = 803).CONCLUSIONSOur findings indicate similarly strong prospective associations with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for A-SAA and hs-CRP and suggest a potential causal link via postchallenge <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
