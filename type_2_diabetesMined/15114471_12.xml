<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The complex aetiology of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, which probably involves a medley of molecular mechanisms, requires dissection out of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-associated subphenotypes, such as the non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> with increased liver fat or the <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> with low plasma adiponectin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The concepts of the hyperbolic relationship of insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> allostasis help us to establish the pathophysiological framework within which such mechanisms must operate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The translation of burgeoning new basic science findings into a physiological and clinical context calls for novel and imaginative clinical experimental tools </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the purpose of this review, four molecules (adiponectin [APM1], <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15541">stearoyl CoA</z:chebi> desaturase-1 [SCD1], insulin receptor substrate-1 [IRS1], peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma [PPARG]), each with a plausible role in the disease process, have been selected to illustrate the use of such techniques in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These include procedures as diverse as isotope dilution for turnover studies (e.g. <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> turnover as a proxy for lipolysis), conventional and modified clamp procedures, association studies of functionally relevant single nucleotide polymorphisms in candidate genes (e.g. IRS-1 and PPAR gamma), multivariate correlational analyses (as with plasma adiponectin), magnetic resonance spectroscopy to quantify intra-tissue <z:mpath ids='MPATH_42'>lipid deposition</z:mpath> and regional fat distribution, and gas chromatography to determine fatty acid patterns in selected <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> fractions as proxy for intrahepatic enzyme activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A concerted effort by scientists from many disciplines (genetics and cell biology, <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> and epidemiology) will be required to bridge the growing gap between basic scientific concepts of biological modifiers of glycaemia and concepts that are truly relevant for human Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
