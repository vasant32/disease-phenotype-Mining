<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate further the relative roles played by liver and adipose tissue in the therapeutic response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 11 patients with diet-treated type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were given <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> for approximately 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Measurements were made before and after treatment of 1) fasting and postprandial plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, and free fatty acid (FFA) concentrations; 2) <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> appearance (Ra) and disappearance (Rd) rates measured overnight with 3-[3H]<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>; and 3) plasma FFA concentrations during a 195-min infusion period at relatively low insulin (approximately 12-24 microU/ml) concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e> fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration was significantly lower (175 +/- 11 vs. 224 +/- 15 mg/dl; P &lt; 0.01) after treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e> insulin concentrations measured from 8:00 A.M. to 5:00 P.M. did not change with treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, both <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and FFA concentrations were significantly lower (P &lt; 0.01) when measured over the same time period, and the decreases in plasma FFA and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration were highly correlated (r = 0.81; P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overnight <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> turnover studies indicated that neither Ra (hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production [HGP]) nor Rd changed significantly with treatment in association with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration was much lower after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> treatment, the overnight <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolic clearance rate (MCR) was significantly lower (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, the ability of insulin to inhibit <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi>-stimulated increases in plasma FFA concentration was enhanced in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>-treated patients (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> treatment was associated with significantly lower fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations and lower day-long plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and FFA concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although overnight HGP was unchanged after treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, the overnight <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> MCR was significantly increased, and the antilipolytic activity of insulin was also enhanced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Given these findings, it is suggested that at least part of the antihyperglycemic effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> is due to a decrease in release of FFA from adipose tissue, leading to lower circulating FFA concentrations and an increase in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake </plain></SENT>
