<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To learn if Mexican-American children from low income neighborhoods have excess <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study involved 173 Mexican-American children aged 9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is the age before type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> usually develops in youths and where the disparity in body fat between Mexican-American and non-Hispanic white children is evident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study also targets poor children because <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and being overweight are more common in Mexican-American adults from a lower than from a higher socioeconomic status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk factors measured were percent body fat, dietary fat intake, daily fruit and vegetable intake, and physical fitness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Body fat was measured by bioelectric impedance, dietary intake was measured by three 24-h dietary recalls, and physical fitness was measured by a modified Harvard step test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: According to self-reported dietary recalls, Mexican-American children ate higher than recommended fat servings and had higher percent energy from fat and saturated fat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, their reported daily fruit and vegetable intake was half of that recommended by national dietary guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A large percentage of these children were at unacceptable physical fitness levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Percent body fat was higher in these Mexican-American children than that reported for non-Hispanic white children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Finally, 60% of the children had a first- or second-degree relative with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Because <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is highly prevalent in Mexican-American adults, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in increasing in Mexican-American youths, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk factors are more common in Mexican-American children, a prudent measure would be to explore early-age <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk factor prevention programs in this population </plain></SENT>
