<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PCLO encodes a presynaptic cytomatrix protein that functions as a Ca(2+) sensor that may be involved in insulin secretion and/or insulin action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, PCLO was analyzed as a candidate gene for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Sequencing of PCLO identified four nonsynonymous variants and a 10-amino acid insertion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These variants, together with 100 additional variants identified by sequencing or chosen from databases, were genotyped for association analysis in the same 895 subjects analyzed in the prior GWA study (300 case subjects with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> at aged &lt;25 years, 334 nondiabetic control subjects aged &gt;45 years, and 261 discordant siblings of the case or control subjects for within-family analyses), as well as 415 nondiabetic Pima Indians who had been metabolically phenotyped for predictors of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Selected variants were further genotyped in a population-based sample of 3,501 Pima Indians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four variants were modestly associated with early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in both general and within-family analyses (P = 0.004-0.04, recessive model), where the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk allele was also nominally associated with a lower insulin-mediated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal rate (P = 0.009-0.14, recessive model) in nondiabetic Pima Indians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, their association with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the population-based sample was weaker (P = 0.02-0.20, recessive model) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Variation within PCLO may have a modest effect on early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, possibly as a result of reduced insulin action, but has minimal, if any, impact on population-based risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
