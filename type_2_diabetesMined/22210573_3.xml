<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed whether NAFLD is associated with abnormalities in cardiac function in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 50 consecutive type 2 diabetic individuals without a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hepatic diseases</z:e>, or excessive alcohol consumption, in whom NAFLD was diagnosed by ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A tissue Doppler echocardiography with myocardial strain measurement was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-two patients (64%) had NAFLD, and when compared with the other 18 patients, age, sex, BMI, waist circumference, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, smoking, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration, microvascular complication status, and medication use were not significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the left ventricular (LV) mass and volumes, ejection fraction, systemic vascular resistance, arterial elasticity, and compliance were also not different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>NAFLD patients had lower e' (8.2 ± 1.5 vs. 9.9 ± 1.9 cm/s, P &lt; 0.005) tissue velocity, higher E-to-e' ratio (7.90 ± 1.3 vs. 5.59 ± 1.1, P &lt; 0.0001), a higher time constant of isovolumic relaxation (43.1 ± 10.1 vs. 33.2 ± 12.9 ms, P &lt; 0.01), higher LV-end diastolic pressure (EDP) (16.5 ± 1.1 vs. 15.1 ± 1.0 mmHg, P &lt; 0.0001), and higher LV EDP/end diastolic volume (0.20 ± 0.03 vs. 0.18 ± 0.02 mmHg, P &lt; 0.05) than those without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>steatosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the measurements of LV global longitudinal strain and strain rate, those with NAFLD also had higher E/global longitudinal diastolic strain rate during the early phase of diastole (E/SR(E)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of these differences remained significant after adjustment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and other cardiometabolic risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and NAFLD, even if the LV <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and systolic function are preserved, early features of LV diastolic dysfunction may be detected </plain></SENT>
