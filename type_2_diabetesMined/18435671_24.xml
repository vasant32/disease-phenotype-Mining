<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This observational, cross-sectional, multicentre study was conducted in seven countries (Finland, France, Germany, Norway, Poland, Spain and UK) from June 2006 to February 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who added a sulphonylurea or a thiazolidinedione to ongoing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> therapy on a date (index date) from January 2001 through January 2006 and who had at least one <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1C (HbA1C) measurement in the 12-month period before the visit date were eligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Questionnaires were used to ascertain patients' reports of hypoglycaemic symptoms, treatment satisfaction, and treatment adherence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication was used to measure patients' treatment satisfaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An adherence and barriers questionnaire was used to measure patients' adherence to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Glycaemic control was based on documented HbA1C measurements within the prior 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean +/- s.d. age was 62.9 +/- 10.6 years, and the mean +/- s.d. duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 7.8 +/- 5.1 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HbA1C in this population of patients who had failed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy and were treated with oral antihyperglycaemic agents was below the International <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Federation goal of 6.5% in only 477 (27.9%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Approximately 38% of patients reported hypoglycaemic symptoms during the past year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hypoglycaemia</z:e> was significantly more likely in patients with a history of macrovascular complications of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (OR = 1.346; 95% CI = 1.050-1.725) and with no regular physical activity (OR = 1.295; 95% CI = 1.037-1.618) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients reporting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> had significantly lower treatment satisfaction scores (71.6 +/- 17.6 vs. 76.3 +/- 16.8; p &lt; 0.0001 for global satisfaction) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Compared with their counterparts reporting no hypoglycaemic symptoms, patients with such symptoms were also significantly more likely to report barriers to adherence, including being unsure about instructions (37.0 vs. 30.5%; p = 0.0057) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients at HbA1C goal had significantly higher treatment satisfaction and adherence compared with those who were not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients' reports of hypoglycaemic symptoms are common in European outpatients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and are associated with significantly lower treatment satisfaction and with barriers to adherence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In addition, being at HbA1C goal is associated with treatment satisfaction and adherence </plain></SENT>
