<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Likewise, small-scale studies of Danish twins have shown that monozygotic twins have a higher risk of developing precursors of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with dizygotic twins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present register-based study, the 10 year period <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevalence in Danish twins is compared with that in a random sample of Danish citizens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the 10 year period prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in monozygotic twins is compared with that in dizygotic twins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study population consisted of twins (n = 77,885) identified in the Danish Twin Registry, and a 5% random sample (n = 215,264) from the birth cohorts 1910-1989 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We identified <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients by means of three nationwide Danish health registers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The number of identified <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> cases among males was 6,677 (6.24%) for singletons vs 2,271 (5.68%) for twins (difference = 0.56% [0.29-0.83%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The number among females was 6,143 (5.67%) for singletons and 1,722 (4.54%) for twins (difference = 1.13% [0.88-0.38%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Restriction to various birth cohorts, known zygosity and known type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> did not alter the overall conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The difference between monozygotic twins (males, 5.29%; females, 4.40%) and dizygotic twins (males, 5.77%; females, 4.63%) was non-significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Danish twins do not have an increased risk of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with singletons, and the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among monozygotic twins does not differ from that of dizygotic twins </plain></SENT>
