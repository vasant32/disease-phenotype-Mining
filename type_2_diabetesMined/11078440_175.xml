<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The triggering pathway is well characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It involves the following sequence of events: entry of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> by facilitated diffusion, metabolism of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> by oxidative glycolysis, rise in the ATP-to-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> ratio, closure of ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels, membrane depolarization, opening of voltage-operated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> channels, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> influx, rise in cytoplasmic free <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> concentration ([<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i), and activation of the exocytotic machinery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The amplifying pathway can be studied when beta-cell [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i is elevated and clamped by a depolarization with either a high concentration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> or a high concentration of K+ in the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4495">diazoxide</z:chebi> (K(ATP) channels are then respectively blocked or held open) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Under these conditions, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> still increases insulin secretion in a concentration-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This increase in secretion is highly sensitive to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (produced by as little as 1-6 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>), requires <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism, is independent of activation of protein kinases A and C, and does not seem to implicate <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33184">long-chain acyl-CoAs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Changes in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16708">adenine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> may be involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The amplification consists of an increase in efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> on exocytosis of insulin granules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There exists a clear hierarchy between both pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The triggering pathway predominates over the amplifying pathway, which remains functionally silent as long as [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i has not been raised by the first pathway; i.e., as long as <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> has not reached its threshold concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The alteration of this hierarchy by long-acting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> or genetic inactivation of K(ATP) channels may lead to inappropriate insulin secretion at low <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The amplifying pathway serves to optimize the secretory response not only to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> but also to nonglucose stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is impaired in beta-cells of animal models of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and indirect evidence suggests that it is altered in beta-cells of type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Besides the available drugs that act on K(ATP) channels and increase the triggering signal, novel drugs that correct a deficient amplifying pathway would be useful to restore adequate insulin secretion in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
