<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed the effects of alogliptin (Alo) and Alo co-administered with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (Pio) vs placebo (Pbo) on triacylglycerol (TG)-rich <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> before and following a high-fat meal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-one patients (age 18-70 years), who did not reach HbA(1c) 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) with lifestyle and/or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> or glinide therapy, participated in this 16 week, double-centre (university hospitals) Pbo-controlled parallel-group study </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fasting TG 1.7-5.0 mmol/l was among the entry criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients received a high-fat mixed meal before and 4 and 16 weeks after randomisation (allocation by central office) to Alo (n = 25), Alo/Pio (n = 22) or Pbo (n = 24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Blood was sampled at pre-specified intervals, starting at 15 min before and ending 8 h after meal ingestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At week 16, Alo (n = 25) and Alo/Pio (n = 21) vs Pbo (n = 24) produced similar significant reductions in total postprandial TG response (incremental AUC [iAUC]; p &lt; 0.001), as well as in chylomicron TG (p &lt; 0.001) and VLDL1 TG iAUCs (p &lt; 0.001 and p = 0.012, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Postprandial chylomicron <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B-48 iAUC showed a significant decrease after Alo treatment (p = 0.028), and a non-significant trend towards a decrease with Alo/Pio (p = 0.213) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence of adverse events was low and consistent with previous studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Treatment with Alo and Alo/Pio produced significant reductions in postprandial TG and TG-rich <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi>, contributing to an improved overall cardiometabolic risk profile in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The data support the concept that incretins not only modulate <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism but also influence chylomicron metabolism in intestinal cells </plain></SENT>
