<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We determined whether plasma CRP level was elevated in Chinese subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) and whether CRP level could be used to predict progression to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or reversion to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (NGT) in these high-risk individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 228 subjects with IGT at baseline from the Hong Kong <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cardiovascular Risk Factors</z:e> Prevalence Study underwent repeat oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance testing after 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma high-sensitivity CRP was measured from their stored baseline samples and from 228 subjects with NGT matched for age and BMI by an immunoturbidimetric assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Subjects with IGT at baseline had higher plasma CRP levels than subjects with NGT: 1.18 mg/l (0.52-2.52) vs. 0.87 mg/l (0.37-1.84), median (interquartile range), P = 0.01 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 2 years, 117 subjects with IGT reverted to NGT, 84 remained in IGT, and 21 progressed to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Individuals who progressed to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had the highest plasma CRP levels at baseline (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Those with baseline CRP levels in the third and top quartile had a relative risk of remaining in IGT or progressing to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> of 2.87 (95% CI 1.06-7.82) and 2.76 (1.06-7.31), respectively, after adjusting for anthropometric measure and lifestyle factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CRP independently predicts the risk of remaining in IGT or progressing to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Chinese subjects with IGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CRP might provide an adjunctive measure for identifying subjects with the highest risk of progression to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who would derive the greatest benefits from preventive interventions </plain></SENT>
