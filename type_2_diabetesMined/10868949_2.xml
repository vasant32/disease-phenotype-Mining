<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This observation and molecular studies indicate that the HNF network is required for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> function of pancreatic beta-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This suggests that transcription factors involved in this complex network are candidates for genetic defects in MODY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because the HNF-3beta gene is implicated in this network, we screened it for mutations in 21 probands of French ancestry with clinical diagnosis of MODY and early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the five known MODY genes, HNF-4alpha, glucokinase, HNF-1alpha, HNF-1beta, and IPF1, were previously excluded as being the cause of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in these families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By direct sequencing, we identified two transitions, an A-to-G at position -213 and a C-to-T at position -63 in the promoter and exon 1, respectively, of the HNF-3beta gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A G-to-C transversion at position +32 in the intron 1 and three transitions, C-to-T at position 291, A-to-G at position 837, and G-to-A at position 1188 in the exon 3, resulting in noncoding mutations Ala97Ala, Gly279Gly, and Gln396Gln, respectively, were also identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The allele frequencies were not significantly different between a control group and MODY probands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Familial segregation studies and linkage analysis showed that genetic variation in the HNF-3beta gene is unlikely to be the cause of early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in these Caucasian families </plain></SENT>
