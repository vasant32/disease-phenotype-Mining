<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: This study aimed to investigate levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Homocysteine</z:chebi> (tHcy) and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> in a population-based sample of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In particular, the study explored modifiable determinants such as treatment for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, life style, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control and kidney function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a community-based surveillance of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 196 men and 191 women were consecutively identified in primary care and characterized by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) risk factors focusing on components in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For categorical associations plasma tHcy was dichotomized using the upper 10 percentiles of the distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treatment with sulphonylurea was associated with lower serum levels of tHcy compared to those on diet alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The association was confined to women [odds ratio 0.14; confidence interval 0.03-0.8] and remained significant when differences in factors related to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e>, life style and previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> were accounted for, but was lost when adjusted for HbA1c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was an inverse dose-related association between physical activity and plasma levels of tHcy (men p = 0.006, women p = 0.034), and a positive association with serum levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> (men p = 0.004, women p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The association with physical activity might be one contributing explanation for its well-known protective effect on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The over risk for vascular complications in diabetic patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> may be partially explained by high levels of tHcy and should be further explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Prospective studies are particularly needed on various treatment for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and tHcy to explore possible implications for clinical procedures and for public health </plain></SENT>
