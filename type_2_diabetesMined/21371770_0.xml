<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 102 DM2 patients divided into four groups to receive daily supplementation for 4 months with: 600 mg LA (n = 26); 800 mg α-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="27013">tocopherol</z:chebi> (n = 25); 800 mg α-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="27013">tocopherol</z:chebi> + 600 mg LA (n = 25); placebo (n = 26) </plain></SENT>
