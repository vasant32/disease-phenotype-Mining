<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Higher circulating proinsulin levels are associated with impaired β-cell function, raised <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2D) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Studies of the insulin processing pathway could provide new insights about T2D pathophysiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We have conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association tests of ∼2.5 million genotyped or imputed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and fasting proinsulin levels in 10,701 nondiabetic adults of European ancestry, with follow-up of 23 loci in up to 16,378 individuals, using additive genetic models adjusted for age, sex, fasting insulin, and study-specific covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine SNPs at eight loci were associated with proinsulin levels (P &lt; 5 × 10(-8)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two loci (LARP6 and SGSM2) have not been previously related to metabolic traits, one (MADD) has been associated with fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, one (PCSK1) has been implicated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and four (TCF7L2, SLC30A8, VPS13C/C2CD4A/B, and ARAP1, formerly CENTD2) increase T2D risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proinsulin-raising allele of ARAP1 was associated with a lower fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (P = 1.7 × 10(-4)), improved β-cell function (P = 1.1 × 10(-5)), and lower risk of T2D (odds ratio 0.88; P = 7.8 × 10(-6)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Notably, PCSK1 encodes the protein prohormone convertase 1/3, the first enzyme in the insulin processing pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A genotype score composed of the nine proinsulin-raising alleles was not associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary disease</z:hpo> in two large case-control datasets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We have identified nine genetic variants associated with fasting proinsulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our findings illuminate the biology underlying <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis and T2D development in humans and argue against a direct role of proinsulin in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
