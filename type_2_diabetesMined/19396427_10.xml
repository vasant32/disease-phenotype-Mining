<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Interleukin-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> (IL-1Ra) prevents <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> and is a potent target for the treatment of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but the mechanisms of its secretion and regulation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we hypothesise the regulation of IL-1Ra secretion by purinergic P2X(7) receptors in islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Production and regulation of P2X(7) were studied in pancreatic sections from lean and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> diabetic patients, non-diabetic controls and in isolated islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IL-1Ra, IL-1beta and insulin secretion, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance and beta cell mass were studied in P2x7 (also known as P2Rx7)-knockout mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: P2X(7) levels were elevated in beta cells of <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients, but downregulated in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Elevated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and non-esterified fatty acids rapidly activated P2X(7) and IL-1Ra secretion in human islets, and this was inhibited by P2X(7) blockade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In line with our results in vitro, P2x7-knockout mice had a lower capacity to secrete IL-1Ra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They exhibited severe and rapid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> and impaired beta cell function in response to a high-fat/high-<z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> diet, were unable to compensate by increasing their beta cell mass in response to the diet and showed increased beta cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our study shows a tight correlation of P2X(7) activation, IL-1Ra secretion and regulation of beta cell mass and function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The increase in P2X(7) production is one mechanism that may explain how beta cells compensate by adapting to the higher insulin demand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Disturbances within that system may result in the progression of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
