<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To explore the role of chronically elevated free fatty acids (FFAs) in the pathogenesis of the hyperproinsulinemia of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we have investigated the effect of FFAs on proinsulin processing and prohormone convertases PC2 and PC1/PC3 in MIN6 cells cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with or without 0.5 mmol/l FFA mixture (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15756">palmitic acid</z:chebi>:<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16196">oleic acid</z:chebi> = 1:2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After 7 days of culture, the percent of proinsulin in FFA-exposed cells was increased (25.9 +/-0.3% intracellular and 75.4 +/- 1.2% in medium vs. 13.5 +/-0.2 and 56.2 +/- 4.1%, respectively, in control cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The biosynthesis and secretion of proinsulin and insulin were analyzed by comparing the incorporation of [3H]Leu and [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37983">35S</z:chebi>]Met </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In pulse-chase studies, proinsulin-to-insulin conversion was inhibited, and proinsulin in the medium was increased by 50% after 3 h of chase, while insulin secretion was decreased by 50% after FFA exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Levels of cellular PC2 and PC3 analyzed by Western blotting were decreased by 23 and 15%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, PC2, PC3, proinsulin, and 7B2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were not altered by FFA exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To test for an effect on the biosynthesis of PC2, PC3, proinsulin, and 7B2, a protein required for PC2 activation, MIN6 cells were labeled with [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37983">35S</z:chebi>]Met for 10-15 min, followed by a prolonged chase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most proPC2 was converted after 6 h of chase in control cells, but conversion was incomplete even after 6 h of chase in FFA-exposed MIN6 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Media from chase incubations showed that FFA-exposed cells secreted more proPC2 than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similar inhibitory effects were noted on the processing of proPC3, proinsulin, and 7B2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, prolonged exposure of beta-cells to FFAs may affect the biosynthesis and posttranslational processing of proinsulin, PC2, PC3, and 7B2, and thereby contribute to the hyperproinsulinemia of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of inhibition of secretory granule processing by FFAs may be through changes in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> concentration, the pH in the secretory granules, and/or other factors that may influence the activation and function of the convertases </plain></SENT>
