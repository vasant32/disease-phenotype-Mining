<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Gevokizumab is a novel, human-engineered monoclonal anti-IL-1β antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the safety and biological activity of gevokizumab in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study, a total of 98 patients were randomly assigned to placebo (17 subjects) or gevokizumab (81 subjects) at increasing doses and dosing schedules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the safety profile of gevokizumab in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The secondary objectives were to assess pharmacokinetics for different dose levels, routes of administration, and regimens and to assess biological activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study drug was well tolerated with no serious adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was one hypoglycemic event whereupon concomitant insulin treatment had to be reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clearance of gevokizumab was consistent with that for a human IgG(2), with a half-life of 22 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the combined intermediate-dose group (single doses of 0.03 and 0.1 mg/kg), the mean placebo-corrected decrease in glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> was 0.11, 0.44, and 0.85% after 1, 2 (P = 0.017), and 3 (P = 0.049) months, respectively, along with enhanced C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> secretion, <z:mp ids='MP_0002891'>increased insulin sensitivity</z:mp>, and a reduction in C-reactive protein and spontaneous and inducible cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This novel IL-1β-neutralizing antibody improved glycemia, possibly via restored insulin production and action, and reduced <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This therapeutic agent may be able to be used on a once-every-month or longer schedule </plain></SENT>
