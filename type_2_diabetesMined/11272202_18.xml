<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Golosow and Grobstein were pioneers in the field of pancreatic developmental research, as were Wessells and Cohen, who already in the 1960s performed classic embryological experiments describing the morphogenesis of the pancreas and the epithelio-mesenchymal interactions that are instrumental for proper pancreas development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent findings suggest that follistatin and fibroblast growth factors represent some of these key mesenchymal factors that actively promote at least pancreatic exocrine development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The true endodermal origin of the pancreatic <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> cells became evident by experiments performed by the groups of LeDouarin and Rutter in the 1970s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The newly acquired insights regarding the specification of pancreatic <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> cells as controlled by the notch signaling pathway (i.e., similar to the mechanisms by which neurons are specified during neurogenesis) have provided a novel understanding of the long acknowledged similarities between neurons and the pancreatic <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Last, the identification of a number of distinct transcription factors operating at various levels of pancreatic development and in different cell types has provided useful information both on pancreas development and on various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0851724" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pancreatic disorders</z:e> such as <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, four of the hitherto defined five different <z:hpo ids='HP_0004904'>maturity-onset diabetes of the young</z:hpo> (MODY) genes correspond to transcription factors, and, in addition, several transcription factors have also been linked to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
