<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a prospective, nested, case-control study (n = 3,520) within the Nurses' Health Study (687 type 2 diabetic case and 1,051 control subjects) and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (886 case and 896 control subjects), we examined the association of a common variant of the TCF7L2 gene (rs12255372 [T/G]) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk among Caucasians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Frequencies of the T-allele were significantly higher among case than control subjects; each copy of the T-allele was associated with a 1.32-fold (P = 0.0002) and 1.53-fold (P &lt; 0.0001) increased type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk in women and men, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The odds ratios (95% CI) associated with homozygous carriers of the T-allele were 1.86 (1.30-2.67) and 2.15 (1.48-3.13) in women and men, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Population-attributable risks for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> associated with the T-allele were 14.8 and 22.3% for women and men, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a meta-analysis of 3,347 case and 3,947 control subjects, each copy of the T-allele was associated with a 1.48-fold increased risk (P &lt; 10(-16)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings confirm that the TCF7L2 gene represents an important locus for predicting inherited susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
