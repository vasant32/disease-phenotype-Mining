<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, 5-year risk estimates were proposed as being more accurate than 10-year risk estimates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study presents a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-specific equation for estimation of the absolute 5-year risk of first incident fatal/nonfatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) in type 2 diabetic patients with use of A1C and clinical characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study was based on 11,646 female and male patients, aged 18-70 years, from the Swedish National <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Register with 1,482 first incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> events based on 58,342 person-years with mean follow-up of 5.64 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: This risk equation incorporates A1C, as in the UK Prospective <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study risk engine, and several clinical characteristics: <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> age of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration, sex, BMI, smoking, systolic blood pressure, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-reducing drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> predictors included were associated with the outcome (P &lt; 0.0001, except for BMI P = 0.0016) with Cox regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Calibration was excellent when assessed by comparing observed and predicted risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Discrimination was sufficient, with a receiver operator curve statistic of 0.70 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean 5-year risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients was 12.0 +/- 7.5%, whereas 54% of the patients had a 5-year risk &gt;or=10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This more simplified risk equation enables 5-year risk prediction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> based on easily available nonlaboratory predictors in clinical practice and A1C and was elaborated in a large observational study obtained from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> patient population aged up to 70 years </plain></SENT>
