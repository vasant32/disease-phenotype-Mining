<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The urine AcSDKP-to-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio was measured blind to treatment in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants who completed follow-up and provided spot urine samples (n = 1,871) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median urinary AcSDKP-to-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio was six times higher for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8774">ramipril</z:chebi> than for placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Urinary AcSDKP-to-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratios displayed a bimodal distribution in both groups, with a very large intergroup overlap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on cluster analysis, we defined truly adherent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8774">ramipril</z:chebi> patients as those with a ratio &gt; or =4 nmol/mmol and truly adherent placebo patients as those with a ratio &lt; 4 nmol/mmol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After excluding patients withdrawing prematurely from the study or known to have used a nonstudy <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitor</z:chebi>, 27.3% of the 597 ramipril patients had ratios &lt;4, indicating poor compliance, and 9.7% of the 621 placebo patients had ratios &gt; or =4, indicating intake of a nonstudy <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitor</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Correcting for compliance by using AcSDKP-guided analysis affected surrogate outcome results (decrease in systolic blood pressure and urinary albumin excretion) only slightly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The systematic use of spot urinary AcSDKP determination facilitated the detection of defects in compliance with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitor</z:chebi> treatment in both patients and physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Urinary AcSDKP measurement could be a useful biomarker for assessing compliance with ACE inhibition in the routine care of diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
