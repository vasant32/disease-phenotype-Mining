<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and serum C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels were determined before and after IV injection of 1mg glucagon on three separate days in 21 type 2 diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Day 1: without pharmacological treatment and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &gt; 11.1 mmol/L; day 2: fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> 4.4-7.8 mmol/L, 1h after withdrawing intravenous regular insulin infusion; day 3: fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> 4.4-7.8 mmol/L with bed-time <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fasting and glucagon stimulated C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels were higher on day 1 than days 2 and 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fasting, but not stimulated C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels, were lower on day 3 than day 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These differences were not appeared when the percentage of C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> increment or the C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> ratio were compared in the three days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> reduction instead of exogenous insulin is responsible for the C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> decrease during insulin therapy in type 2 diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
