<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A systematic review was performed using published articles from January 2000 to August 2010 that linked intervention, disease, study design and outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Studies were further classified as initiation and intensification based on predefined criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Individual studies in systematic reviews and meta-analysis were searched and included if relevant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 2690 articles were screened with 76 (40 initiation and 36 intensification) studies included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most initiation studies had mean baseline HbA1c values of &gt;8.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The endpoint HbA1c values were reduced with insulin treatment in these studies, with endpoint values ranging from 6.6 to 9.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similar results were seen with the intensification studies (endpoint HbA1c: 6.4-9.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Addition of insulin to oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetics</z:chebi> (OADs) resulted in better glycaemic control in most studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels reduced substantially with OADs + insulin compared with OADs alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Quality of life outcomes and treatment satisfaction were reported in six studies and not significantly different for insulin vs. OADs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Hypoglycaemic events were manageable with insulin initiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> insulin types were associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> although the comparison with OADs elicited varying results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Proactive management with early insulin initiation and intensification should be considered in people with T2DM in inadequate glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The economic benefits with early initiation and intensification have to be fully explored </plain></SENT>
