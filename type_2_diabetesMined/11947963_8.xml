<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> on the expression of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transporter 4 (GLUT4) in muscle and adipose tissue from Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rat, an animal model of <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> on GLUT4 translocation and on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transport activity in adipocytes were also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Muscle and adipose tissues were isolated from 35-week-old male <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi>-treated and untreated OLETF rats at a dose of 150 mg/kg per day for 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In skeletal muscle, the protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of GLUT4 were not significantly different between OLETF and control rats and they were not affected by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, GLUT4 protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels in adipose tissue from OLETF rats were significantly decreased (P&lt;0.01) compared with control rats and they were significantly increased (1.5-fold, P&lt;0.01) by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">Troglitazone</z:chebi> had no major effect on GLUT4 translocation in adipocytes, but it significantly increased (1.4-fold, P&lt;0.05) the basal and insulin-induced amounts of GLUT4 in plasma membrane (PM) in adipocytes from OLETF rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Consistent with these results, the basal and insulin-induced <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptakes in adipocytes from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi>-treated OLETF rats were significantly increased (1.5-fold, P&lt;0.05) compared with untreated OLETF rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> may exert beneficial effects on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> by increasing the expression of GLUT4 in adipose tissue </plain></SENT>
