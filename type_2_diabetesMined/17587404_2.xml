<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Pulse pressure (PP) has been reported to be increased in patients with abdominal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aim of the present study is to verify the association of high PP with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> (MS) and with its individual components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The relationship between PP and MS was studied in a sample of 1724 subjects aged (mean +/- s.d.) 52.8 +/- 1.3 years, enrolled in a screening programme for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> FIrenze-Bango A Ripoli (FIBAR) study, and in a consecutive series of 1775 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> aged 64.3 +/- 9.1 years; only subjects not treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> medication were included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the FIBAR sample, PP was significantly higher in subjects with MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A significant correlation of PP was found in women with waist circumference, fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> (r = 0.14, 0.15, and 0.09 respectively), and in men with fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> only (r = 0.09); the correlation was no longer significant after adjustment for age and mean blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similar results were obtained in the series of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: High PP is associated with MS and its components, but this association seems to disappear after adjustment for age and mean blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the present data, high PP cannot be considered as one of the alterations associated with MS </plain></SENT>
