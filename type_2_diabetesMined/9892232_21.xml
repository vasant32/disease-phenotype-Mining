<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is caused by an increase in hepatic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> synthesis and secretion that is secondary to an increase in de novo lipogenesis, a decrease in fatty acid (FA) oxidation, and an increase in the flux of peripherally derived FA to the liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The uptake of FA across the plasma membrane may be mediated by three distinct proteins--FA translocase (FAT), plasma membrane FA binding protein (FABP-pm), and FA transport protein (FATP)--that have recently been characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17984">Acyl-CoA</z:chebi> synthetase (ACS) enhances the uptake of FAs by catalyzing their activation to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17984">acyl-CoA</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">esters</z:chebi> for subsequent use in anabolic or catabolic pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examine the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of FAT, FABP-pm, FATP, and ACS in the liver and adipose tissue of genetically <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (ob/ob) mice and their control littermates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FAT <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were 15-fold higher in liver and 60-80% higher in adipose tissue of ob/ob mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FABP-pm <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were twofold higher in liver and 50% higher in adipose tissue of ob/ob mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FATP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were not increased in liver or adipose tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ACS <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were higher in adipose tissue but remained unchanged in liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the distribution of ACS activity associated with mitochondria and microsomes in liver was altered in ob/ob mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In control littermates, 61% of ACS activity was associated with mitochondria and 39% with microsomes, whereas in ob/ob mice 34% of ACS activity was associated with mitochondria and 66% with microsomes; this distribution would make more FA available for esterification, rather than oxidation, in ob/ob mouse liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our results suggest that the upregulation of FAT and FABP-pm <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> may increase the uptake of FA in adipose tissue and liver in ob/ob mice, which, coupled with an increase in microsomal ACS activity in liver, will enhance the esterification of FA and support the increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> synthesis and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi> production that characterizes <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
