<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Search <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the publications about the association between TCF7L2 and T2DM in East Asian population from PubMed, CNKI and abstracts of major <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> conferences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Perform the meta-analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the validated studies and evaluate the association between rs7903146 T allele, rs12255372 T allele, rs11196205 C allele, rs290487 C allele and rs11196218 G allele of TCF7L2 and the risk of T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eleven studies from nine eligible papers and one unpublished study of ours were included in the meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ten eligible studies were analyzed for rs7903146, five were analyzed for rs12255372 and rs11196205, and three were analyzed for rs290487 and rs11196218 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that four SNPs (rs7903146, rs12255372, rs11196205, rs290487) in TCF7L2 were significantly associated with T2DM in East Asian populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rs11196218 also showed a marginal association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The estimated population-attributable risk (PAR) associated with analyzed SNPs ranged from 2% to 7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SNPs in TCF7L2 were strongly associated with the risk of T2DM in East Asian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>But the contribution of its genetic variants to the epidemic of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in East Asian was relatively low </plain></SENT>
