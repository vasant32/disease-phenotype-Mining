<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: We examined the clinical characteristics of non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> Japanese children with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) not associated with β-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Of 218 children who were diagnosed as having T2DM by a school urine <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> screening program in Tokyo, 24 were identified as being non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>None of the children had any evidence of β-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean ages at diagnosis and at the study were 12.5±1.7 and 22.4±5.7 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Females were predominant (M/F ratio: 4/20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Family history of T2DM, mostly of the non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> type, was present in 62.5% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In regard to the birth weight, 20.8% had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birth weight</z:hpo>, and 8.3% were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001520'>large for gestational age</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean fasting insulin level, HOMA-R, HOMA-β, and an insulinogenic index on the OGTT at the time of diagnosis were 11.8±7.8μU/ml, 5.4±3.8, 96.1±55.0 and 0.16±0.14, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most patients were treated by either oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic drug</z:chebi> (45.8%) or insulin (50.0%) therapy at the study, with the mean interval to the start of pharmacological treatment of 3.1±2.3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> children with T2DM seemed to show lower insulin secretory capacities with mild, but evident, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> even from the time of diagnosis, and also earlier requirement of pharmacological therapies during the clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Some genetic factors not associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> may play a role in the etiology of T2DM in non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> children </plain></SENT>
