<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Prevalence, Prediction and Prevention of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> (PPP)-Botnia study is a population-based study in Western Finland, which includes a random sample of 5,208 individuals aged 18 to 75 years identified through the national Finnish Population Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Physical activity, dietary habits and family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were assessed by questionnaires and physical fitness by a validated 2 km walking test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Insulin secretion and action were assessed based upon OGTT measurements of insulin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was associated with a 2.4-fold risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and lower physical fitness (maximal aerobic capacity 29.2 +/- 7.2 vs 32.1 +/- 7.0, p = 0.01) despite having similar reported physical activity to that of individuals with no family history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The same individuals also had <z:mp ids='MP_0003059'>reduced insulin secretion</z:mp> adjusted for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, i.e. disposition index (p &lt; 0.001) despite having higher BMI (27.4 +/- 4.6 vs 26.0 +/- 4.3 kg/m(2), p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Individuals with a family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are characterised by lower physical fitness, which cannot solely be explained by lower physical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They also have an impaired capacity of beta cells to compensate for an increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> imposed by an increase in BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These defects should be important targets for interventions aiming at preventing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in individuals with inherited susceptibility to the disease </plain></SENT>
