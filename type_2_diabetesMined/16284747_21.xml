<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A post hoc analysis of data from the Collaborative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">Atorvastatin</z:chebi> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study (CARDS), a randomised, placebo-controlled trial of 2,838 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> (10 mg daily) or placebo and were evaluated for cardiovascular and other outcomes over a median follow-up period of 3.9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards modelling was carried out, and the hazard ratios calculated for various times after randomisation to treatment were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A reduction in the primary endpoint of major <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> events was apparent and statistically significant as soon as 18 months after treatment initiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> on CHD events was apparent by 6 months, and at 1 year was similar to the 37% relative risk reduction observed at trial closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">Atorvastatin</z:chebi> alters the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> rapidly, such that the effect on cardiovascular events is apparent within months of initiation of therapy </plain></SENT>
