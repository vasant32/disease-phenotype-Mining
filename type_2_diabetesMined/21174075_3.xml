<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study we investigated whether a lifestyle intervention is sufficient to place <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> insulin-resistant (OIR) individuals in a position where the possible metabolic consequences are similar to those for MHO individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 262 non-diabetic individuals participated in a 9 month lifestyle intervention programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>Obese</z:mp> individuals (BMI ≥ 30.0 kg/m(2)) were stratified, based on their insulin sensitivity (IS) estimated from an OGTT, into MHO (IS in the upper quartile, n = 26) and OIR (IS in the lower three quartiles, n = 77) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Total body and visceral fat were measured by magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) tomography and liver fat by (1)H-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> spectroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the intervention, visceral fat decreased significantly in both groups (both p ≤ 0.009), whereas total body and liver fat decreased only in the OIR group (p &lt; 0.0001; MHO p = 0.12 for total body fat and p = 0.47 for liver fat) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IS improved in the OIR group (p &lt; 0.0001), but remained essentially unchanged in the MHO group (p = 0.30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, despite the significant increase in the OIR group, IS at follow-up barely exceeded 50% of the IS of the MHO group (OIR 9.30 ± 0.53 arbitrary units [AU]; MHO 16.41 ± 1.05 AU; p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: IS improves during the lifestyle intervention in OIR individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, it does not reach a level where adequate protection from type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> is expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, stratification of <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals based on their metabolic phenotype is important to identify those who are likely to need early pharmacological treatment in addition to the lifestyle intervention </plain></SENT>
