<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This article proposes five stages in the progression of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, each of which is characterized by different changes in beta-cell mass, phenotype, and function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Stage 1 is compensation: insulin secretion increases to maintain normoglycemia in the face of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and/or decreasing beta-cell mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This stage is characterized by maintenance of differentiated function with intact <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Stage 2 occurs when <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels start to rise, reaching approximately 5.0-6.5 mmol/l; this is a stable state of beta-cell adaptation with loss of beta-cell mass and disruption of function as evidenced by diminished GSIS and beta-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002793" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">dedifferentiation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Stage 3 is a transient unstable period of early decompensation in which <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels rise relatively rapidly to the frank <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> of stage 4, which is characterized as stable decompensation with more severe beta-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002793" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">dedifferentiation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, stage 5 is characterized by severe decompensation representing a profound reduction in beta-cell mass with progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001946'>ketosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Movement across stages 1-4 can be in either direction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For example, individuals with treated type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> can move from stage 4 to stage 1 or stage 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, as remission develops, progression from stage 4 to stage 2 is typically found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Delineation of these stages provides insight into the pathophysiology of both progression and remission of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
