<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> in diet-treated type 2 diabetic subjects, we measured arteriovenous differences and tissue blood flow in forearm muscle and subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue, used stable isotope techniques, and analysed gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Responses to a mixed meal containing [1,1,1-(13)C]tripalmitin were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">Rosiglitazone</z:chebi> induced insulin sensitisation without altering fasting NEFA concentrations (-6.6%, p=0.16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Postprandial NEFA concentrations were lowered by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> compared with placebo (-21%, p=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adipose tissue NEFA release was not decreased in the fasting state by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> treatment (+24%, p=0.17) and was associated with an increased fasting hormone-sensitive lipase rate of action (+118%, p=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Postprandial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> concentrations were decreased by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> treatment (-26%, p&lt;0.01) despite unchanged fasting concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">Rosiglitazone</z:chebi> did not change concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>-rich <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> remnants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adipose tissue blood flow increased with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> (+32%, p=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postprandial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> [(13)C]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15756">palmitic acid</z:chebi> concentrations were unchanged, whilst NEFA [(13)C]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15756">palmitic acid</z:chebi> concentrations were decreased (p=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In muscle, hexokinase II <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was increased by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> (+166%, p=0.001) whilst the expression of genes involved in insulin signalling was unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Adipose tissue expression of FABP4, LPL and FAT/CD36 was increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">Rosiglitazone</z:chebi> decreases postprandial NEFA and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This may represent decreased spillover of NEFAs from adipose tissue depots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Decreased delivery of NEFAs to the liver may lead to lowered postprandial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Upregulation of hexokinase II expression in muscle may contribute to insulin sensitisation by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
