<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 28-day study conducted at two sites, in 29 subjects with T2DM not optimally controlled on insulin and up to one oral antihyperglycaemic agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects were treated with canagliflozin 100 mg QD or 300 mg twice daily (BID) or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic characteristics and pharmacodynamic effects of canagliflozin were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002024'>malabsorption</z:hpo> following a 75-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> challenge was also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Canagliflozin pharmacokinetics were dose-dependent, and the elimination half-life ranged from 12 to 15 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 28 days, the renal threshold for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excretion was reduced; urinary <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excretion was increased; and A1C, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and body weight decreased in subjects administered canagliflozin (A1C reductions: 0.19% with placebo, 0.73% with 100 mg QD, 0.92% with 300 mg BID; body weight changes: 0.03 kg increase with placebo, 0.73 kg reduction with 100 mg QD, 1.19 kg reduction with 300 mg BID) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence of adverse events was similar across groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no clinically meaningful changes in routine laboratory safety tests, vital signs or electrocardiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In subjects receiving insulin and oral antihyperglycaemic therapy, canagliflozin was well tolerated without evidence for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002024'>malabsorption</z:hpo>, had pharmacokinetic characteristics consistent with once-daily dosing, and improved glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
