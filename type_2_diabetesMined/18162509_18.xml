<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Posttransplantation <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (PTDM) is a major metabolic complication in renal transplant recipients, and insulin secretory defects play an important role in the pathogenesis of PTDM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The R325W (rs13266634) nonsynonymous polymorphism in the islet-specific zinc transporter protein gene, SLC30A8, has been reported to be associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and possibly with a defect in insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the association between genetic variations in the SLC30A8 gene and PTDM in renal allograft recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 624 unrelated renal allograft recipients without previously diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rs13266634 was genotyped in the cohort, which consisted of 174 posttransplantation diabetic patients and 450 non-posttransplantation diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The genotyping of the SLC30A8 polymorphism was performed using real-time PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of PTDM was 33.8% in patients carrying the R/R genotype, 26.8% in patients with the R/W genotype, and 19.8% in patients with the W/W genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a strong association between the number of W-alleles and PTDM risk reduction (P for trend = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with at least one T-allele showed a decreased risk of PTDM compared with those with the R/R genotype (R/W, risk ratio [RR] 0.78, P = 0.126; W/W, RR 0.52, P = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The effect of the SLC30A8 genotype remained significant after adjustments for age, sex, body <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>, and type of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressant</z:chebi> (R/W, hazard ratio [HR] 0.77, P = 0.114; W/W, HR 0.58, P = 0.026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data provide evidence that the SLC30A8 rs13266634 gene variation is associated with protection from the development of PTDM in renal allograft recipients </plain></SENT>
