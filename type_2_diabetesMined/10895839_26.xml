<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To estimate the impact of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during pregnancy on transgenerational genetically caused and/or fuel-mediated amplification of types 1 and 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and to estimate the impact of elevated amniotic fluid insulin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 75 white offspring of type 1 diabetic mothers and 49 control subjects of similar age and pubertal stage were examined at 5-15 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> offspring had an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> were measured at 0, 30, 60, and 120 min after loading </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">Lipids</z:chebi> and autoimmune antibodies were measured in fasting plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 75 offspring, 4 (5.3%) had overt <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and 16 of 71 (22.5%) had autoimmune antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Offspring of diabetic mothers had significantly higher BMI; symmetry indexes; cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels; and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> than control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With the exception of cholesterol, these values were significantly elevated in offspring who had elevated amniotic fluid insulin levels (&gt;8 microU/ml, &gt;48 pmol/l) during pregnancy compared with normoinsulinemic offspring and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Offspring of type 1 diabetic mothers have an increased risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> later in life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The relative risk for type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is 71.6 and 3.2, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-associated risk factors, such as high BMI; elevated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels; and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, are related to the fetal metabolic experience in utero, as reflected by amniotic fluid insulin concentration </plain></SENT>
