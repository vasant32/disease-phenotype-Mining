<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate access and utilization of medical care, and health status and outcomes that would be influenced by recent medical care, in a representative sample of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A national sample of 733 adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was studied from 1991 to 1994 in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Structured questionnaires and clinical and laboratory assessments were used to determine the frequencies of physician visits, health insurance coverage, screening for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> complications, treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e>; and the proportion of patients who met treatment goals and established criteria for health outcome measures including <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had 1 source of primary care (95%), 2 or more physician visits during the past year (88%), and health insurance coverage (91%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most (76%) were treated with insulin or oral agents for their <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and 45% of those patients taking insulin monitored their blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> at least once per day The patients were frequently screened for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (52%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (88%), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> (84%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of those patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, 83% were diagnosed and treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive agents</z:chebi> and only 17% were undiagnosed or untreated; most of the patients known to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> were treated with medication or diet (89%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Health status and outcomes were less than optimal: 58% had HbA1c &gt;7.0, 45% had BMI &gt;30, 28% had <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp>, and 8% had clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of those patients known to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e>, 60% were not controlled to accepted levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, 22% of patients smoked cigarettes, 26% had to be hospitalized during the previous year, and 42% assessed their health status as fair or poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Rates of health care access and utilization, screening for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> complications, and treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are high; however, health status and outcomes are unsatisfactory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There are likely to be multiple reasons for this discordance, including intractability of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> to current therapies, patient self-care practices, physician medical care practices, and characteristics of U.S. health care systems </plain></SENT>
