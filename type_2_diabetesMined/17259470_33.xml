<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in children &lt;17 years of age and to investigate the relationship of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with increasing childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in the U.K. and the Republic of Ireland (ROI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Active monthly reporting of cases by consultant pediatricians occurred through the framework of the British Pediatric Surveillance Unit, with additional reports from specialist <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> nurses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> children &lt;17 years of age and diagnosed by their clinician as having non-type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from 1 October 2004 to 31 October 2005 were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 168 confirmed cases of non-type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were reported, resulting in a national incidence (excluding the ROI) of 1.3 x 100,000(-1) x year(-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these, 40% were diagnosed with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> giving a minimum incidence of 0.53 x 100,000(-1) x year(-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Children of ethnic minorities were greatly overrepresented, with those of black and South-Asian origin (England data only) having an incidence of 3.9 and 1.25 x 100,000(-1) x year(-1), respectively, compared with 0.35 x 100,000(-1) x year(-1) in those defined as white </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of those diagnosed with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 95% were overweight and 83% <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> according to International <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> Task Force guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eighty-four percent had a family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is still less common than type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in U.K. children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, compared with previous prevalence data, the frequency of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> appears to be increasing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Incidence among ethnic minorities is far higher than in whites, as previously described in the U.S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0010024'>Increased adiposity</z:mp> and family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were strongly associated with the diagnosis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in U.K. children </plain></SENT>
