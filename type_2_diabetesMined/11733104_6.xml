<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>Mitochondrial</z:hpo> transcription factor A (mtTFA), which provides the replication primer, plays a key role for the regulation of mtDNA replication and its level is proportional to mtDNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we studied on the regulatory mechanism of mtTFA expression and the factors affecting the transcriptional activity of the mtTFA promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The promoter of human mtTFA contains 67 CpG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When the plasmids bearing the mtTFA promoter (2378 bp) linked to luciferase were transiently transfected into HepG2 cells, in vitro methylation of NRF-1 site by HhaI methylase abolished the mtTFA promoter activity up to 90%, implying that the CpG methylation of NRF-1 site inactivate mtTFA promoter-driven transcriptional activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Besides the promoter methylation, the exogenous <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> also modulates the promoter activity of mtTFA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The bacterially overexpressed mtTFA protein exhibits a strong binding affinity to circular DNA (perhaps to mtDNA in mitochondria in vivo) and the protection of the DNA from cleavage by a <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> attack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taken <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these results together, age-related alterations of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> may affect mtDNA replication via regulating mtTFA activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a vicious cycle may be present between mtTFA protein level and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in the sense of DNA damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further studies were necessary to prove the presence of <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> in the mtTFA promoter of either an aged or a diabetic person and the effect of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> on the mtTFA function and expression resulting in a change of the mtDNA copy number </plain></SENT>
