<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A non-treatment-seeking sample of 115 children (aged 5-13 years), oversampled for being at risk for adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, was assessed at baseline and again ~6 years later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Children self-reported depressive symptoms using the Children's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Inventory at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo> was assessed at baseline and follow-up with the homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> index (HOMA-IR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS Children's depressive symptoms were a significant predictor of follow-up HOMA-IR, fasting insulin, and fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in models accounting for baseline HOMA-IR, insulin, or <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> values; sex; race; baseline age; baseline BMI; change in BMI at follow-up; family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; and time in the study (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS In this study, depressive symptomatology at baseline predicted the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> during child and adolescent development independent of changes in BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Research is needed to determine whether early intervention to decrease elevated depressive symptoms in youth ameliorates later development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and lessens the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
