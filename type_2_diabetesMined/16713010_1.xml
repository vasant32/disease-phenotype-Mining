<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: It was carried out a long-term prospective study with 471 type 2 diabetic outpatients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several clinical, laboratory and electrocardiographic variables were recorded at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Predictive factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>-related mortality were evaluated by Kaplan-Meyer estimation of survival curves, univariate and multivariate Cox survival analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Excess <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>-related mortality in this cohort was evaluated by comparing its rate with that of the Rio de Janeiro background population and calculating standardized mortality rates (SMR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During a median follow up of 57 months (range: 1-86 months), 40 (33.1%) patients died from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>-related causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for age and sex, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>-related SMR was 6.6 (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 4.8-9.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In Cox multivariate analysis the predictors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>-related mortality were older age (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.91; 95% CI: 1.35-2.70), pre-existing <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral arterial disease</z:hpo> (HR: 3.86; 95% CI: 1.80-8.28) and cerebrovascular disease (HR: 3.28; 95% CI: 1.24-8.70), lower <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> (HR: 2.50; 95% CI: 1.32-4.74) and increased 24h-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> (HR: 1.22; 95% CI: 1.08-1.37) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After excluding patients with peripheral and cerebrovascular disease at baseline, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> were selected as predictors of mortality, besides older age and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Brazilian type 2 diabetic patients have a six-fold excess <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>-related mortality than the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This increased mortality is mainly determined by the presence of micro and macrovascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Multifactorial risk interventions are needed in order to decrease this burden of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>-related mortality </plain></SENT>
