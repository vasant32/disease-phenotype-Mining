<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Controlled clinical trials assessing the effect sizes of sibutramine on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> effects on glycemia in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were identified and reviewed using the Cochrane Library, Medline, EMBASE, and a manual search </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized trials of sibutramine were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After sibutramine treatment, the decrease in body weight and waist circumference was significantly greater than in the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and HbA(1c) significantly decreased after sibutramine treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment benefits were seen in plasma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>, without significant variations in serum total and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No differences in systolic blood pressure between the sibutramine and the placebo groups were seen, while recording of diastolic blood pressure and heart rate showed that sibutramine produced a small increase relative to placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A pharmacological approach in a weight management program for patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may be helpful in glycemic control and in the management of other risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sibutramine may help improve <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control because it is conducive to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The reviewed data on the effect of sibutramine further enforce the recommendations that weight management may be the most important therapeutic task for most <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
