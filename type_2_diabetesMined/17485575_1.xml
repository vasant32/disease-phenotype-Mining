<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Although tight blood pressure (BP) control is proven to reduce <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related cardiovascular risk, it has been difficult to achieve in practice, perhaps in part because of low-quality monitoring data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that low-quality BP data, reflected in end-digit preference (EDP), remains common in primary care of diabetic adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data were abstracted from the charts of 404 adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> seen at 16 academically affiliated clinics from 1999 to 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>End-digits of systolic and diastolic BPs taken with nonautomated sphygmomanometers were extracted, and prevalence of EDP for zero was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Associations between EDP and selected patient characteristics were determined using multiple logistic regressions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: EDP was highly prevalent in the BP measurements taken by nonphysicians (4,333 BPs; 50% of systolic, 50% of diastolic readings ended in zero; P &lt; 0.001) and physicians (1,347 BPs; 69% of systolic, 64% of diastolic readings ended in zero; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, nonphysicians showed greater EDP for systolic BP in older patients (odds ratio [OR] 1.07 per 5 years) and women (OR 1.36 vs. men) and for diastolic BP in African-Americans (OR 1.25 vs. whites; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05); physicians showed greater EDP for diastolic BP in less <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients (OR 0.97 per 5 kg/m2 increment in BMI; P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Low-quality BP measurement is common in primary care of diabetic adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Procedural and technological improvements to BP measurement deserve attention as part of an overall strategy to tighten BP control and reduce cardiovascular risk </plain></SENT>
