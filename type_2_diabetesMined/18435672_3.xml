<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A flexible, discrete-event simulation model has been developed to evaluate alternative treatment strategies based on the United Kingdom Prospective <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study Outcomes Model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present analysis, the model is used to investigate the impact of alternative HbA1c thresholds for treatment intensification ranging from 7.0 to 9.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For each intensification strategy, the model is run using 80 simulated patients for each of 1224 patient profiles from the Real-Life Effectiveness and Care Patterns of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Management study (for a total of 97,920 simulated patients) to project the number of patients who will experience <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related complications over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The use of lower HbA1c thresholds for intensifying treatment is associated with improved long-term outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When the HbA1c threshold for intensifying therapy from oral treatment to basal insulin (T1) is 7.0% and the threshold for intensifying basal insulin to multiple-dose insulin (T2) is 7.0%, simulated patients spend 54% of their time with HbA1c &gt;7.0%, but 95% of their time with HbA1c &gt;7.0% if T1 and T2 are set to 9.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More aggressive or proactive treatment postures are projected to reduce clinical events, including <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related complications, particularly <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarctions</z:hpo> (MIs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When T1 and T2 are set to 7.0%, there are 592 fewer <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in the first 5 years of the simulation and 3740 fewer <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> over 40 years compared with the results when T1 and T2 are set to 9.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These decreases in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were also associated with a 0.35 year gain in projected life expectancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with an aggressive strategy with both T1 and T2 being 7%, 644 more patients are projected to experience at least one episode of MI in the first 5 years if treatment intensification is delayed until HbA1c reaches 9.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This number increases over time, reaching 2906 additional patients experiencing at least one MI over a 40-year time period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We report results from a discrete-event simulation model to explore the impact of alternative treatment strategies for patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Strategies that intensify therapy (in response to rising HbA1c levels) at lower HbA1c thresholds (e.g. 7.0%) are associated with enhanced projected long-term health outcomes </plain></SENT>
