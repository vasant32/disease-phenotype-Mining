<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Skeletal muscle energy metabolism and function are not impaired by GPi during high-intensity contraction in rat skeletal muscle; however, it is unknown whether <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> phosphorylase inhibitors would impair function during prolonged lower-intensity contraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Utilizing a novel red cell-perfused rodent gastrocnemius-plantaris-soleus system, muscle was pretreated for 60 min with either 3 micromol/l free drug GPi (n=8) or vehicle control (n=7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During 60 min of aerobic contraction, GPi treatment resulted in approximately 35% greater <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Muscle <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> phosphorylase a form (P&lt;0.01) and maximal activity (P&lt;0.01) were reduced in the GPi group, and postcontraction <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> (121.8 +/- 16.1 vs. 168.3 +/- 8.5 mmol/kg dry muscle, P&lt;0.05) was greater </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, lower muscle <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> efflux and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake (P&lt;0.01), yet higher muscle Vo(2), support the conclusion that carbohydrate utilization was impaired during contraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data provide new confirmation that muscle <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> plays an essential role during submaximal contraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Given the critical role of exercise prescription in the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, it will be important to monitor endurance capacity during the clinical evaluation of nonselective GPi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, greater effort should be devoted toward the discovery of hepatic-selective GPi, hepatic-specific drug delivery strategies, and/or alternative strategies for controlling excess hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
