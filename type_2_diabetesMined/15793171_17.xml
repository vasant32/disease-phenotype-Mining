<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We recruited 198 community-based patients randomized to PC or usual care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PC patients had face-to-face goal-directed medication and lifestyle counseling at baseline and at 6 and 12 months plus 6-weekly telephone assessments and provision of other educational material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical, biochemical, and medication-related data were sent regularly to each patient's physician(s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The main outcome measure was change in HbA(1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-specific risk engine was used to estimate changes in 10-year <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> (CHD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk in patients without a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At total of 180 patients (91%) completed the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean (95% CI) reductions were greater in PC case subjects (n = 92) than control subjects (n = 88) for HbA(1c) (-0.5% [95% CI -0.7 to -0.3] vs. 0 [-0.2 to 0.2]) and systolic (-14 mmHg [-19 to -9] vs. -7 [-11 to -2]) and diastolic (-5 mmHg [-8 to -3] vs. -2 [-4 to 1]) blood pressure (P &lt; or = 0.043) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The improvement in HbA(1c) persisted after adjustment for baseline value and demographic and treatment-specific variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median (interquartile range) 10-year estimated risk of a first CHD event decreased in the PC case subjects (25.1% [15.6-36.2] to 20.3 [14.6-30.2]; n = 42, P = 0.002) but not in the control subjects (26.1% [17.2-39.4] vs. 26.4 [16.7-38.0]; n = 52, P = 0.17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A 12-month PC program in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> reduced glycemia and blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Pharmacist involvement contributed to improvement in HbA(1c) independently of pharmacotherapeutic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>PC could prove a valuable component of community-based multidisciplinary <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care </plain></SENT>
