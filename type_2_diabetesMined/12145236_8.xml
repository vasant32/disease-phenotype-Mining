<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To find an optimal critical line in the fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG)-HbA(1c) plane for identifying <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in participants with impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (IFG) and thereby improve the efficacy of using FPG alone in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> screening among American Indians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used FPG, 2-h postload <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (2hPG), and HbA(1c) measured in the 2,389 American Indians (aged 45-74 years, without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treatment or prior history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) in the Strong Heart Study (SHS) baseline (second) examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants were classified as having <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> if they had either FPG &gt; or =126 mg/dl or 2hPG &gt; or =200 mg/dl, as having IFG if they had 110 &lt; or = FPG &lt; 126 mg/dl, and as having <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (NFG) if they had FPG &lt;110, according to the American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association (<z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi>) definition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression models were used for identifying <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (2hPG &gt; or =200 mg/dl) in IFG participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves generated by different logistic regression models were evaluated and compared to select the best model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A utility function based on the best model and the cost-to-benefit ratio was used to find the optimal critical line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The data from the second examination were used to study the effect of the time interval between the successive <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> screenings on both the FPG criterion and the optimal critical line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 37% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects with new <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at baseline and 55.2% of those in the second exam had 2hPG &gt; or =200 but FPG &lt;126 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a very large portion of IFG participants with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (19.3 and 22.9% in the baseline and second exam, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among the areas under the ROC curves, the area generated by the logistic regression model on FPG plus HbA(1c) is the largest and is significantly larger than that based on FPG (P = 0.0008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For a cost-to-benefit ratio of 0.23888, the optimal critical line that has the highest utility is: 0.89 x HbA(1c) + 0.11 x FPG = 17.92 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Those IFG participants whose FPG and HbA(1c) were above or on the line were referred to take an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) to diagnose <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The optimal critical line is lower if a successive <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> screening will be conducted 4 years after the previous screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: FPG &gt; or =126 and 2hPG &gt; or =200, as suggested by the <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi>, are used independently to define <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The FPG level is easy to obtain, and using FPG alone is suggested for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>It is difficult to get physicians and patients to perform an OGTT to get a 2hPG level because of the many drawbacks of the OGTT, especially in those patients who already have FPG &lt;126 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>It is also impractical to conduct an OGTT for everyone in a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Our data show that 37% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects with new <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the SHS baseline exam and 55.2% of those in the second exam have 2hPG &gt; or =200 but FPG &lt;126 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>These cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> cannot be detected if FPG is used alone in a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Therefore, although the small portion of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the NFG group (4.7% in the baseline and 6.9% in the second exam) may be ignored, those cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among IFG participants ( approximately 20% in our data) need further consideration in a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>It may be worthwhile for those IFG participants identified by the optimal critical line to take an OGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The optimal critical line and time interval between successive <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> screenings need further study </plain></SENT>
