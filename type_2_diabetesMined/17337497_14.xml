<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>More effective medication prescription might result in better control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the process by which physicians choose <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering medicines is poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We sought to study the means by which physicians choose medications for type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We surveyed 886 physician members of either the Society of General Internal Medicine (academic generalists, response rate 30%) or the American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association (specialists, response rate 23%) currently managing patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Respondents weighed the importance of 15 patient, physician, and nonclinical factors when deciding which medications to prescribe for type 2 diabetic subjects at each of three management stages (initiation, use of second-line oral agents, and insulin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Respondents reported using a median of five major considerations (interquartile range 4-6) at each stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Frequently cited major considerations included overall assessment of the patient's health/comorbidity, A1C level, and patient's adherence behavior but not expert guidelines/hospital algorithms or patient age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For insulin initiation, academic generalists placed greater emphasis on patient adherence (76 vs. 60% of specialists, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These generalists also identified patient fear of injections (68%) and patient desire to prolong noninsulin therapy (68%) as major insulin barriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall, qualitative factors (e.g., adherence, motivation, overall health assessment) were somewhat more highly considered than quantitative factors (e.g., A1C, age, weight) with mean aggregate scores of 7.3 vs. 6.9 on a scale of 0-10, P &lt; 0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The physicians in our survey considered a wide range of qualitative and quantitative factors when making medication choices for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The apparent complexity of the medication choice process contrasts with current evidence-based treatment guidelines </plain></SENT>
