<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Few studies have assessed whether 24-h blood pressure control induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive agents</z:chebi> improves macroalbuminuria in hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients with overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2668">amlodipine</z:chebi> on 24-h blood pressure, autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> activity, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this open-label, parallel-prospective, randomized study, 44 patients were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> and 43 with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2668">amlodipine</z:chebi> for a 12-week titration phase and a maintenance phase for a maximum of 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four-hour blood pressure and urinary albumin excretion were measured before and during treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Simultaneously, power spectral analysis of heart rate was performed to evaluate low frequency (LF) and high frequency (HF) components and LF-to-HF ratios as an index of sympathovagal balance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">Losartan</z:chebi> decreased (P &lt; 0.001) mean blood pressure from 162/91 to 150/82 mmHg during daytime and from 146/82 to 137/74 mmHg during nighttime (systolic/diastolic) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="2668">Amlodipine</z:chebi> also decreased (P &lt; 0.001) blood pressure from 159/90 to 147/82 mmHg during daytime and from 143/81 to 131/72 mmHg during nighttime </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LF and HF components and nighttime-to-daytime ratios for the LF-to-HF ratios did not differ during treatment in two groups, showing no changes in the diurnal autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">Losartan</z:chebi> decreased (P &lt; 0.001) 24-h urinary albumin excretion from 810 mg/day (95% CI 780-1,140) to 570 (510-910) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="2668">Amlodipine</z:chebi>, however, did not decrease (P = 0.893) <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> (790 mg/day [780-1,170] vs.790 [710-1,260]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, 24-h blood pressure regulation alone is inadequate to reduce macroalbuminuria and additional effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> are crucial for antiproteinuric action </plain></SENT>
