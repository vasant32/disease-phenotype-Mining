<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a prospective randomised parallel trial involving 61 adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> consecutively recruited in primary care and randomised by drawing ballots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients that did not speak Swedish could not be recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary outcomes in this non-blinded study were weight and HbA(1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients on the LFD aimed for 55-60 energy per cent (E%) and those on LCD for 20 E% from carbohydrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean BMI and HbA(1c) of the participants were 32.7 ± 5.4 kg/m(2) and 57.0 ± 9.2 mmol/mol, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No patients were lost to follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>Weight loss</z:hpo> did not differ between groups and was maximal at 6 months: LFD -3.99 ± 4.1 kg (n=31); LCD -4.31 ± 3.6 kg (n=30); p &lt; 0.001 within groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 24 months, patients on the LFD had lost -2.97 ± 4.9 kg and those on LCD -2.34 ± 5.1 kg compared with baseline (p = 0.002 and p = 0.020 within groups, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>HbA(1c) fell in the LCD group only (LCD at 6 months -4.8 ± 8.3 mmol/mol, p = 0.004, at 12 months -2.2 ± 7.7 mmol/mol, p = 0.12; LFD at 6 months -0.9 ± 8.8 mmol/mol, p = 0.56) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At 6 months, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> had increased with the LCD (from 1.13 ± 0.33 mmol/l to 1.25 ± 0.47 mmol/l, p = 0.018) while <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> did not differ between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Insulin doses were reduced in the LCD group (0 months, LCD 42 ± 65 E, LFD 39 ± 51 E; 6 months, LCD 30 ± 47 E, LFD 38 ± 48 E; p = 0.046 for between-group change) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Weight changes did not differ between the diet groups, while insulin doses were reduced significantly more with the LCD at 6 months, when compliance was good </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Thus, aiming for 20% of energy intake from carbohydrates is safe with respect to cardiovascular risk compared with the traditional LFD and this approach could constitute a treatment alternative </plain></SENT>
