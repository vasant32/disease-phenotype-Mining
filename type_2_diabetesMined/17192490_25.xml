<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, multiple studies of the same variant have often been discordant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From a literature search, we identified previously reported type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-associated SNPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We initially genotyped 134 SNPs on 786 index case subjects from type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> families and 617 control subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance from Finland and excluded from analysis 20 SNPs in strong linkage disequilibrium (r(2) &gt; 0.8) with another typed SNP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 114 SNPs examined, we followed up the 20 most significant SNPs (P &lt; 0.10) on an additional 384 case subjects and 366 control subjects from a population-based study in Finland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the combined data, we replicated association (P &lt; 0.05) for 12 SNPs: PPARG Pro12Ala and His447, KCNJ11 Glu23Lys and rs5210, TNF -857, SLC2A2 Ile110Thr, HNF1A/TCF1 rs2701175 and GE117881_360, PCK1 -232, NEUROD1 Thr45Ala, IL6 -598, and ENPP1 Lys121Gln </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The replication of 12 SNPs of 114 tested was significantly greater than expected by chance under the null hypothesis of no association (P = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We observed that SNPs from genes that had three or more previous reports of association were significantly more likely to be replicated in our sample (P = 0.03), although we also replicated 4 of 58 SNPs from genes that had only one previous report of association </plain></SENT>
