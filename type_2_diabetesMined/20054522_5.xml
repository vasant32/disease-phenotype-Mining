<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 2,033 eligible Japanese men and women aged 40-70 years with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from 59 institutes were randomised to a conventional treatment group (CON), which continued to receive the usual care, and a lifestyle intervention group (INT), which received education on lifestyle modification regarding dietary habits, physical activities and adherence to treatment by telephone counselling and at each outpatient clinic visit, in addition to the usual care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Randomisation and open-label allocation were done by a central computer system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Primary analysis regarding measurements of control status and occurrence of macro- and microvascular complications was based on 1,304 participants followed for an 8 year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although status of control of most classic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, including body weight, glycaemia, serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and BP, did not differ between groups during the study period, the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the INT group (5.48/1,000 patient-years) was significantly lower than in the CON group (9.52/1,000 patient-years) by Kaplan- Meier analysis (p=0.02 by logrank test) and by multivariate Cox analysis (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.39-0.98, p=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of CHD, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> did not differ significantly between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">Lipoprotein</z:chebi>(a) was another significant independent risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These findings suggest that lifestyle modification had limited effects on most typical control variables, but did have a significant effect on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> incidence in patients with established type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
