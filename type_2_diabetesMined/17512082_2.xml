<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Baseline characteristics of the Japan <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Complications Study, a representative cohort of Japanese diabetic patients, were used for quartile analysis stratified according to patient body mass index (BMI) and EI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite a 1.4-fold discrepancy in BMI between the highest and the lowest quartiles, no significant linear trend in HbA(1C) levels or EI between quartiles was seen, although, waist/hip ratio, blood pressure, total cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> increased and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> decreased with the increase in BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Quartile analysis, according to EI, revealed a 1.8-fold elevation in EI between the lowest and the highest quartile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the differences in patient BMI between the lowest and the highest quartile were no more than 3% and there were no significant linear trends among the four quartiles in most parameters including HbA(1C), blood pressure, serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results revealed only very limited cross-sectional correlations among BMI, EI and other parameters suggesting that it is necessary to consider much wider variations in ideal weight and optimal dietary prescription when making assessments of diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
