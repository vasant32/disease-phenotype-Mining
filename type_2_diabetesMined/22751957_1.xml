<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The possible interaction of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in regard to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> has not been well studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To explore the effect modification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> on the association between 25(OH)D and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>/type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, data were examined from a nationally representative sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The analytic sample for the type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> analysis (n = 12,900) was limited to participants from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2001-2006 over 20 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Participants &gt;20 years of age assigned to the morning session and free of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were limited to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> analysis (n = 5,806) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multiplicative interaction was assessed through a cross-product interaction term in a multiple logistic regression model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of additive interaction between insufficient 25(OH)D and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (indicated by BMI or waist circumference) was evaluated by calculation of the relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI) and attributable proportion due to interaction (AP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no multiplicative interaction of insufficient 25(OH)D and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> on type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, none of the RERI or AP values were statistically significant in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, there was strong additive interaction between abdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and insufficient 25(OH)D (RERI 6.45 [95% CI 1.03-11.52]) in regard to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, 47% of the increased odds of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> can be explained by interaction between insufficient 25(OH)D and high BMI (AP 0.47 [95% CI 0.08-0.87]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Within a cross-sectional, nationally representative sample, abdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and insufficient 25(OH)D interact to synergistically influence the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
