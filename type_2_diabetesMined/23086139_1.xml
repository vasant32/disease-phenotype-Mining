<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate concentration of plasma insulin glargine after its subcutaneous dosing compared with concentration of its metabolites 1 (M1) and 2 (M2) in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Nine subjects underwent a 32-h euglycemic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> clamp study (0.4 units/kg glargine after 1 week of daily glargine administration) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Glargine, M1, and M2 were measured by a specific liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Glargine was detected in only five of the nine subjects, at few time points, and at negligible concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>M1 was detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects and exhibited the same pattern as traditional radioimmunoassay-measured plasma insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>M2 was not detected at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: After subcutaneous injection, glargine was minimally detectable in blood, whereas its metabolite M1 accounted for most (&gt;90%) of the plasma insulin concentration and metabolic action of the injected glargine </plain></SENT>
