<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the current study was to determine whether leptin treatment has <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>-independent effects on insulin action in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled trial in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects (BMI: 35.4 ± 0.6 kg/m(2); mean ± SE) with newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects were randomized to treatment with placebo (saline), low-dose (30 mg/day), or high-dose (80 mg/day) recombinant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32648">methionyl</z:chebi> human (r-Met hu) leptin for 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multiorgan insulin sensitivity before and after treatment was evaluated by using the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp procedure in conjunction with stable isotopically labeled tracer infusions to measure <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi>, and fatty acid kinetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Low-dose and high-dose leptin treatment resulted in a threefold (P &lt; 0.01) and 150-fold (P &lt; 0.001) increase in basal plasma leptin concentrations, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, neither low-dose nor high-dose therapy had an effect on insulin-mediated suppression of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi>, or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> rates of appearance into plasma compared with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, leptin treatment did not increase insulin-mediated stimulation of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal compared with placebo (14.3 ± 3.1, 18.4 ± 3.6, 16.7 ± 2.4 vs. 17.5 ± 2.5, 20.7 ± 3.0, 19.1 ± 3.3 μmol/kg body wt/min before vs. after treatment in the placebo, low-dose, and high-dose leptin groups, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: r-Met hu leptin does not have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>-independent, clinically important effects on insulin sensitivity in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
