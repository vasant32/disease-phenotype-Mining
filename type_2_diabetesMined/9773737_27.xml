<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 1,418 subjects diagnosed with IGT according to the World Health Organization's criteria and having a fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration &gt; or =5.6 mmol/L were randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> (100 mg t.i.d.) or placebo for a predictive median follow-up period of 3.9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome is the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosed using a 75-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test according to the new criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The secondary outcomes are changes in blood pressure, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile, insulin sensitivity, cardiovascular events, and morphometric profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Screening was performed in a high-risk population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As of 1 March 1997, 4,424 subjects had been screened, and data were available for 3,919 (88.5%) subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these subjects, 1,200 (30.6%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo>, 521 (13.3%) had previously undetected type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and 679 (17.3%) had IGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the IGT population, 412 (60.7%) subjects were eligible for the study This population had the following characteristics: the mean age was 54.8 years, 52% of the subjects were female, 53% had more than one risk factor for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, &gt;90% had a family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 78.2% had a BMI &gt; or =27 kg/m2, 47.5% had <z:mp ids='MP_0002842'>high blood pressure</z:mp>, 51.2% had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e>, and 22.8% of the women had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Screening of a high-risk population yields one eligible subject per every 10 volunteers screened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study should definitely answer the question of whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> can prevent or delay the progression of IGT to type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
