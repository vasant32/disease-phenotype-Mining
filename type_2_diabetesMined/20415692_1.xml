<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This open-label, parallel-group, two-arm, pilot study compared the beta-cell protective effect of adding insulin glargine (GLA) vs. <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin to ongoing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Overall, 28 insulin-naive type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> subjects (mean +/- SD age, 61.5 +/- 6.7 years; <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration, 9.8 +/- 6.5 years; HbA1c, 7.1 +/- 0.5%; BMI, 30.7 +/- 4.3 kg/m(2)) treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> were randomized to add once-daily GLA or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> at bedtime </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At baseline and after 3 months, subjects received a standardized breakfast, lunch and dinner, with pre- and postprandial blood sampling to measure plasma IP, total insulin and blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (BG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Insulin dose after 3 months was comparable in both groups (GLA vs. <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e>: 23.6 +/- 13.4 vs. 23.3 +/- 12.7; p = NS ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both treatments significantly reduced fasting BG levels (GLA: 158 +/- 19 to 121 +/- 23 mg/dl; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e>: 156 +/- 34 to 119 +/- 29 mg/dl; both p &lt; 0.01 vs. baseline) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fasting and postprandial BG levels did not differ between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IP levels decreased in both groups (p &lt; 0.05 at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> timepoints) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although IP release after breakfast did not differ between treatments, GLA induced a greater reduction in IP release after lunch (p = 0.08) and dinner (p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Total plasma insulin levels did not differ between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Adding basal insulin to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> reduces postprandial beta-cell load </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>While GLA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> had comparable effects at breakfast, GLA reduces beta-cell stress more effectively at dinner, and with a trend at lunch, most probably because of its longer lasting pharmacodynamic profile </plain></SENT>
