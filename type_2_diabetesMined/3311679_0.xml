<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To assess whether more modest insulinopenia can also cause insulin antagonism, male Sprague-Dawley and female <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (fa/fa) <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> rats received <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> injections (20, 30 or 40 mg/kg) or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50744">citrate</z:chebi> buffer alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After 1 and 2 weeks, the animals underwent <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (0.5 g/kg) and insulin (0.2 U/kg)-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (0.7 mg/kg) tolerance tests, respectively, after an overnight fast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the Sprague-Dawley rats: (a) basal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations were significantly increased in the 40 mg/kg group; (b) <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced insulin responses were significantly decreased in the 30 and 40 mg/kg groups; (c) <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disappearance rates after <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> alone were significantly decreased in the 40 mg/kg group; and (d) <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disappearance rates after insulin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> were significantly decreased in both the 30 and 40 mg/kg group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> rats injected with 30 and 40 mg/kg died within the first week with marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the 20 mg/kg groups: (a) basal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were significantly elevated; (b) <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disappearance rates and insulin responses were significantly decreased; (c) <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disappearance rates after insulin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> were 20% lower than in the control rats but the difference did not reach statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> rats are much more sensitive to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> than Sprague-Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the Sprague-Dawley strain, a modest insulin deficiency is associated with insulin antagonism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Since these rats treated with low doses of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> are characterized by decreased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced insulin secretion and insulin antagonism, they may serve as an appropriate model for type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
