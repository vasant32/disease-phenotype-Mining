<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of intensive insulin therapy on preheparin LPL mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two subjects (total group) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> receiving treatment by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin injection twice a day in the morning and evening were switched to basal bolus insulin (BBI) therapy (fast-acting insulin after each meal and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin before bedtime) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 14 subjects, the total daily insulin dose was not change after switching to BBI therapy (iso-dose group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 3 months of BBI therapy, preheparin LPL mass increased significantly from 47 to 56 ng/ml in total group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> and serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels decreased significantly, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol</z:chebi> increased significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">Low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> levels did not changed but increase in size was suggested by PAG disc electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similar changes were observed in the iso-dose group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that BBI therapy enhances preheparin LPL mass, accompanied by antiatherogenic changes in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
