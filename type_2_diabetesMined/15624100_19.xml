<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesised that consumption of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="25681">omega-3 fatty acids</z:chebi> would enhance vascular function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Saturated fat reduces FMD for several hours, but there is inconsistent evidence about whether foods containing unsaturated fats impair FMD acutely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Little is known about the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> effects of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="25681">omega-3 fatty acids</z:chebi> on vascular reactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We measured FMD before and 4 h after 3 test meals (50 g fat, 2,615 kJ) in 18 healthy adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25413">monounsaturated fatty acids</z:chebi> (MUFA) meal contained 50 g fat from high oleic safflower and canola oils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two additional meals were prepared by replacing 7% to 8% of MUFA with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36005">docosahexaenoic acid</z:chebi> and eicosapentaenoic acid from sardine oil or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27432">alpha-linolenic acid</z:chebi> from canola oil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the sample as a whole, FMD was increased 17% at 4 h vs. the fasting baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After the MUFA meal, subjects with the largest increases in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triacylglycerols</z:chebi> had the largest FMD decreases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The opposite pattern was observed after meals containing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36005">docosahexaenoic acid</z:chebi> and eicosapentaenoic acid or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27432">alpha-linolenic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In subjects with high fasting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triacylglycerols</z:chebi>, meals containing 3 to 5 g of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="25681">omega-3 fatty acids</z:chebi> increased FMD by 50% to 80% and MUFA alone had no significant effects on FMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Endothelium-dependent vasodilation was not impaired 4 h after meals containing predominantly <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27208">unsaturated fatty acids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The fatty acid composition of the meal and the metabolic status of the individual determine the vascular effects of a high-fat meal </plain></SENT>
