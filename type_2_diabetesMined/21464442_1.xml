<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is the most common form of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> worldwide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some of its complications, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e>, are long-term and protracted, with an unclear etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Given this problem, genetic model systems, such as in flies where type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> can be modeled and studied, offer distinct advantages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used individual flies in experiments: control and mutant individuals with partial loss-of-function insulin pathway genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We measured wing size and tested body weight for growth phenotypes, the latter by means of a microbalance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We studied total <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> and carbohydrate content, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> by a reaction in single fly homogenates with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18346">vanillin</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="5" ids="26078">phosphoric acid</z:chebi>, and carbohydrates with an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33835">anthrone</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26836">sulfuric acid</z:chebi> reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cholinesterase activity was measured using the Ellman method in head homogenates from pooled fly heads, and electroretinograms with glass capillary microelectrodes to assess performance of central brain activity and <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Flies with partial loss-of-function of insulin pathway genes have significantly <z:mp ids='MP_0001262'>reduced body weight</z:mp>, higher total <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> content, and sometimes elevated carbohydrate levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Brain function is impaired, as is <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> function, but no clear correlation can be drawn from <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system function and metabolic state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These studies show that flies can be models of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>They weigh less but have significant <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> gains (<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>); some also have carbohydrate gains and compromised brain and <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This is significant because flies have an open circulatory system without microvasculature and can be studied without the complications of vascular defects </plain></SENT>
