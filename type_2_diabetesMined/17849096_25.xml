<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We explored the relationship between liver fat and suppression of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>(1) production by insulin in participants with a broad range of liver fat content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A multicompartmental model was used to determine the kinetic parameters of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B and TG in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>(1) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>(2) after a bolus of [(2)H(3)]leucine and [(2)H(5)]<z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> during a hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp in 20 male participants: eight with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 12 control volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The participants were divided into two groups with low or high liver fat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were in the high liver-fat group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results showed a rapid drop in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>(1)-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B and -triacylglycerol secretion in participants with low liver fat during the insulin infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, participants with high liver fat showed no significant change in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>(1) secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>(1) suppression following insulin infusion correlated with the suppression of NEFA, and the ability of insulin to suppress the plasma NEFA was impaired in participants with high liver fat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A novel finding was an inverse response between <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>(1) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>(2) secretion in participants with low liver fat: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>(1) secretion decreased acutely after insulin infusion whereas <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>(2) secretion increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Insulin downregulates <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>(1) secretion and increases <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>(2) secretion in participants with low liver fat but fails to suppress <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>(1) secretion in participants with high liver fat, resulting in overproduction of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>(1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, liver fat is associated with lack of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>(1) suppression in response to insulin </plain></SENT>
