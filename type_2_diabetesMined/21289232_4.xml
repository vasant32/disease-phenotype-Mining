<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Genes were quantified by RT-PCR in EAT and thoracic subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) obtained during surgery in CAD patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> (MS) or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and control subjects with minimal or no CAD and no MS or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Increased expression of interleukin-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> (IL-1Ra) and IL-10, a trend for higher IL-1β, and no change in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) was found in EAT from MS or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only PPARγ <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was reduced in SAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">Pioglitazone</z:chebi> therapy in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was associated with decreased expression of IL-1β, IL-1Ra, and IL-10 in EAT; decreased IL-10 in SAT; and increased PPARγ in SAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In MS and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with CAD, proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory genes were differentially increased in EAT and selectively reduced in association with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
