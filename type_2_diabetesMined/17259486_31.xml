<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We sought to estimate the rate of progression from newly acquired (incident) impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (IFG) to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> under the old and new IFG criteria and to identify predictors of progression to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We identified 5,452 members of an HMO with no prior history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, with at least two elevated fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tests (100-125 mg/dl) measured between 1 January 1994 and 31 December 2003, and with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> test before the two elevated tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> data were obtained from electronic records of routine clinical care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects were followed until they developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, died, left the health plan, or until 31 December 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 8.1% of subjects whose initial abnormal fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was 100-109 mg/dl (added IFG subjects) and 24.3% of subjects whose initial abnormal fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was 110-125 mg/dl (original IFG subjects) developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Added IFG subjects who progressed to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> did so within a mean of 41.4 months, a rate of 1.34% per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Original IFG subjects converted at a rate of 5.56% per year after an average of 29.0 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A steeper rate of increasing fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>; higher BMI, blood pressure, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>; and lower <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> predicted <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, these are the first estimates of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence from a clinical care setting when the date of IFG <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> is approximately known under the new criterion for IFG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The older criterion was more predictive of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Many newly identified IFG patients progress to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in &lt;3 years, which is the currently recommended screening interval </plain></SENT>
