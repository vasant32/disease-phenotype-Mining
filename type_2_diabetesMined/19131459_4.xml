<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 363 subjects with impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (IFG) or newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> followed a dietary intervention (replacement of cooked refined rice with whole grains and an increase in vegetable intake) and regular walking for 12 weeks without any medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adiponectin gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (45, 276, and -11377) were examined in these subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After this dietary intervention, fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels decreased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three SNP 45T&gt;G genotype groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects with the SNP 45TT genotype showed <z:mp ids='MP_0004892'>increased adiponectin levels</z:mp> and decreased HOMA-IR indexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Haplotype analysis revealed that homozygous carriers of the TG haplotype (45TT and 276GG) and heterozygous carriers of the TG haplotype (TG/X) showed a reduction in the HOMA-IR index after adjustment for baseline levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant differences were observed in changes in HOMA-IR indexes and adiponectin concentrations according to the 45-276 TG haplotype in overweight-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, but not in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-weight subjects: the greatest decrease in HOMA-IR indexes and the greatest increase in adiponectin levels were shown in overweight-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects with the TG/TG haplotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ADIPOQ genetic variants can affect circulating adiponectin levels and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> indexes in subjects with IFG or newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in response to dietary intervention </plain></SENT>
