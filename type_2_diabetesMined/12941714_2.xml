<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To document <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevalence among African-American and non-Hispanic white youth in a two-county region in South Carolina </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a population-based surveillance effort to identify case subjects aged 0-18.9 years with a physician diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> residing in a two-county region in 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Case subjects were ascertained from hospitals, the sole office of pediatric endocrinology, and several smaller sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Case subjects were classified according to the diagnosis made by a pediatric endocrinologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As a completeness check, eight randomly selected physicians were queried for eligible case subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Capture-recapture provided an additional measure of completeness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prevalence estimates used U.S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>2000 Census data for the two-county denominator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Crude total <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevalence was 1.7 cases per 1000 youth and similar between African-American and non-Hispanic white youth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among younger youth (0-9.9 years), non-Hispanic white total prevalence was 1.1 per 1000 and African-American prevalence was 0.6 per 1000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among older youth (10.0-18.9 years), non-Hispanic white total prevalence was 2.5 per 1000 and African-American prevalence was 3.1 per 1000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was only confirmed among older prevalent cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Ascertainment completeness was estimated to be 98% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our estimates suggest that total <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevalence among non-Hispanic white youth is similar to rates observed over 20 years ago </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Among African-American youth, the difference in prevalence noted between younger and older age-groups was notably greater than that observed among the non-Hispanic white youth, potentially reflecting a more marked increase in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence with age </plain></SENT>
