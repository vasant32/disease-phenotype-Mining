<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: A1C is widely considered the gold standard for monitoring effective blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, a genome-wide association study reported an association between A1C and rs7072268 within HK1 (encoding hexokinase 1), which catalyzes the first step of glycolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HK1 deficiency in erythrocytes (red blood cells [RBCs]) causes severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001930'>nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia</z:hpo> in both humans and mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The contribution of rs7072268 to A1C and the RBC-related traits was assessed in 6,953 nondiabetic European participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We additionally analyzed the association with hematologic traits in 5,229 nondiabetic European individuals (in whom A1C was not measured) and 1,924 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> control-related markers other than A1C were analyzed in 18,694 nondiabetic European individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> case-control study included 7,447 French diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our study confirms a strong association between the rs7072268-T allele and increased A1C (beta = 0.029%; P = 2.22 x 10(-7)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, despite adequate study power, rs7072268 showed no association with any other markers of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control (fasting- and 2-h post-OGTT-related parameters, n = 18,694) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, rs7072268-T allele decreases <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels (n = 13,416; beta = -0.054 g/dl; P = 3.74 x 10(-6)) and hematocrit (n = 11,492; beta = -0.13%; P = 2.26 x 10(-4)), suggesting a proanemic effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The T allele also increases risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (836 cases; odds ratio 1.13; P = 0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: HK1 variation, although strongly associated with A1C, does not seem to be involved in blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Since HK1 rs7072268 is associated with reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels and favors <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, we propose that HK1 may influence A1C levels through its anemic effect or its effect on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in RBCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These findings may have implications for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosis and clinical management because <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> is a frequent complication of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> state </plain></SENT>
