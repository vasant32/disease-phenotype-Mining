<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE We recently showed that <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> oxidation, estimated by urinary excretion of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanosine (8-oxoGuo), independently predicted mortality in a cohort of 1,381 treatment-naive patients with newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present investigation, we analyzed urine collected 6 years after the diagnosis to assess the association between urinary markers of nucleic acid oxidation and mortality in patients with established and treated <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We used data from the 970 patients who attended the screening for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> complications 6 years after the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards regression was used to examine the relationship between urinary markers of DNA oxidation (8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine [8-oxodG] [n = 938]) and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> oxidation (8-oxoGuo [n = 936]) and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS During a median of 9.8 years of follow-up, 654 patients died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Urinary 8-oxoGuo assessed 6 years after the diagnosis was significantly associated with mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related mortality of patients with 8-oxoGuo levels in the highest quartile compared with those in the lowest quartile were 1.86 (95% CI 1.34-2.58) and 1.72 (1.11-2.66), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conversely, 8-oxodG was not associated with mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, we found an association between changes in 8-oxoGuo from diagnosis to 6-year follow-up and mortality, with increased risk in patients with an increase and decreased risk in patients with a decrease in 8-oxoGuo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS The <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> oxidation marker 8-oxoGuo is an independent predictor of mortality in patients with established and treated type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and changes in 8-oxoGuo during the first 6 years after diagnosis are associated with mortality </plain></SENT>
