<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Affected relative pairs with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were recruited through the Sea Islands Genetic African American Registry (Project SuGAR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a genome-wide linkage scan, genotyping 5,974 single nucleotide polymorphisms in 471 affected subjects and 50 unaffected relatives from 197 pedigrees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data were analyzed using a multipoint engine for rapid likelihood inference and ordered subsets analyses (OSAs) for age at type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosis, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We searched for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> and interactions using a conditional logistic regression likelihood approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Linkage peaks on chromosome 14 at 123-124 cM were detected for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (logarithm of odds [LOD] 2.10) and for the subset with later age at type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosis (maximum LOD 4.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two linkage peaks on chromosome 7 were detected at 44-45 cM for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (LOD 1.18) and at 78 cM for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (LOD 1.64) and the subset with earlier age at type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosis (maximum LOD 3.93) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The chromosome 14 locus and a peak on 7p at 29.5 cM were identified as important in the multilocus model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Other regions that provided modest evidence for linkage included chromosome 1 at 167.5 cM (LOD 1.51) and chromosome 3 at 121.0 cM (LOD 1.61) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed a novel type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> locus in an African American population on 14q that appears to reduce age of disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and confirmed two loci on chromosome 7 </plain></SENT>
