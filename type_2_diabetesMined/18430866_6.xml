<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We performed a comprehensive genetic association study of common variation spanning the IGF2BP2 locus in order to replicate the association of the "confirmed" type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility variants rs4402960 and rs1470579 in the French Caucasian population and to further characterize the susceptibility variants at this novel locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We genotyped a total of 21 tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms spanning the IGF2BP2 locus in our type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> case-control cohort comprising 3,093 French Caucasian subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IGF2BP2 variants rs4402960 and rs1470579 were not associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the present study (P = 0.632 and P = 0.896, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Meta-analysis of genotype data from over 34,000 subjects demonstrated that our inability to replicate rs4402960/rs1470579 was consistent with the findings from several previous genome-wide association study (GWAS) datasets that were underpowered to detect this modest association signal (odds ratio [OR] 1.14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We obtained novel evidence that rs9826022, a borderline rare variant (5% minor allele frequency) in the 3' downstream region, was associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P = 0.0002; OR 1.53 [95% CI 1.22-1.91]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This result was corroborated by the meta-analysis of 10,542 genotypes from the current study and GWAS datasets using both fixed (P = 9.47 x 10(-6); 1.30 [1.16-1.46]) and random effects (P = 0.001; 1.30 [1.11-1.52)] calculations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We were unable to replicate the confirmed rs4402960/rs1470579 susceptibility variants but found novel evidence for a rare variant in the 3' downstream region of IGF2BP2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further genetic and functional studies are required to identify the etiological IGF2BP2 variants </plain></SENT>
