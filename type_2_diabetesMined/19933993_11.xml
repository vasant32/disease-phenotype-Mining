<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a cohort of Hispanic women with recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> mellitus, oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests (OGTTs), intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests (IVGTTs), and bioelectrical impedance measurements were performed at 15-month intervals for up to 5 years, or until fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> exceeded 140 mg/dl (7.8 mmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data were analyzed to identify predictors of declining beta-cell compensation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (the disposition index [DI]) and to examine the mechanism of <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> and changes in circulating levels of selected adipokines and inflammatory markers on beta-cell compensation decline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 60 nondiabetic women had a median of four sets of OGTT + IVGTT during a median follow-up of 52 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fourteen of the women developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of the baseline characteristics were significantly predictive of a decline in DI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were significant univariate associations between declining DI and <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> (specifically fat gain), declining adiponectin and rising C-reactive protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that the <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> was the most significant factor associated with declining DI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The amount of association between <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> and declining DI was explained 31% by changes in adiponectin and C-reactive protein and 40% by changes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results identify <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> as the strongest factor associated with declining beta-cell compensation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in Hispanic women at high risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Such effect may be mediated through at least two effects: alterations in adipokine levels and increasing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
