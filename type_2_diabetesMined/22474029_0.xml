<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested whether the direction of association with 20 T2D risk variants generalizes across six major racial/ethnic groups in the U.S. as part of the Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology Consortium (16,235 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> case and 46,122 control subjects of European American, African American, Hispanic, East Asian, American Indian, and Native Hawaiian ancestry) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The percentage of positive (odds ratio [OR] &gt;1 for putative risk allele) associations ranged from 69% in American Indians to 100% in European Americans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the nine variants where we observed significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of effect by racial/ethnic group (P(<z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>) &lt; 0.05), eight were positively associated with risk (OR &gt;1) in at least five groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The marked directional consistency of association observed for most genetic variants across populations implies a shared functional common variant in each region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fine-mapping of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> loci will be required to reveal markers of risk that are important within and across populations </plain></SENT>
