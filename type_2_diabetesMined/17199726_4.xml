<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study was designed to determine the biological activity of its two major metabolites, S 15511 and Y 415, and whether or not they have an additive effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> Diabetic Fatty rats were treated for 28 days with S 15511 (10 mg/kg), Y 415 (10 mg/kg), or a combination at the same doses for a period of 4 weeks starting at 6-7 weeks of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An additional group was pair-fed to the level of S 15511-treated animals to determine if possible effects were due to reduced food intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: S 15511 alone and combined with Y 415 reduced energy intake and <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> (-13% vs. controls; both p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Baseline fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were maintained by S 15511, S 15511 + Y 415 and pair-feeding (p &lt; 0.01) for the entire treatment period (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Baseline insulin was maintained by pair-feeding only, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other treated groups became hyperinsulinaemic (+110-276%; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Deterioration in insulin sensitivity [homeostasis model assessment (HOMA)-IR: + 239%; p &lt; 0.01] was attenuated by S 15511, S 15511 + Y 415 and pair-feeding (p &lt; 0.01) and was compensated for by improved insulin secretion (HOMA-beta; p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests, performed on days 0, 14 and 28, showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups had an impaired insulin response, but by day 28, S 15511, S 15511 + Y 415 and pair-feeding had improved <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal compared to the progressive deterioration in untreated controls (-44% to -48% vs. controls; p &lt; 0.01), associated with progression to frank <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in these animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Treatment with these agents in a genetic model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> reveals that they <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> have a transient effect compared to the progressive worsening of vehicle-treated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The improvements in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism observed with S 15511 are significant, however, suggesting it has more therapeutic activity than the Y 415 metabolite of S 15261 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is associated with less frequent progression to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; i.e. Y 415 exerts a non-significant effect alone and no significant additive effect when combined with S 15511 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of action of S 15511 may be via <z:mp ids='MP_0002891'>increased insulin sensitivity</z:mp> and beta-cell response preservation up to day 21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Thus, previously reported insulin secretagogue effects are likely to be attributable to the parent compound </plain></SENT>
