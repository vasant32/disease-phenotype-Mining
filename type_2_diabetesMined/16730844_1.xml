<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>NSY and control C3H/He mice were fed several types of dietary chow from 4 weeks of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Autoclaved CRF-1, whose major components are almost the same as those of the MF diet except for increased pellet hardness, resulted in a significant reduction in body weight in both NSY (p&lt;0.05) and C3H (p&lt;0.001) mice at 16 weeks of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in NSY mice fed autoclaved CRF-1 was significantly lower than that in those fed MF at 36 weeks of age (p&lt;0.05), which was associated with a significant decrease in body weight (p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 16 weeks of age, NSY mice fed with a hard diet (autoclaved CRF-1) showed a significantly lower body weight (32.1+/-0.3g) and blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels during ipGTT than those with fed a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (gamma-irradiated CRF-1) (35.6+/-1.3g, p&lt;0.05 and &lt;0.01, respectively) or soft (powdered CRF-1) (p&lt;0.05 and &lt;0.05, respectively) diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Switching from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (gamma-irradiated) to hard (autoclaved) chow, even after the development <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at 36 weeks of age, markedly improved <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> after 4 weeks in NSY mice despite the small change in body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate the importance of food hardness as an environmental factor in the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
