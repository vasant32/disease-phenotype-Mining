<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated effects of a medium and high saturated fat diet on the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-associated pathologies in Golden Syrian hamsters, an animal that reacts to dietary <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> in a fashion similar to humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three diets containing 46.5 kcal %, 267.3 kcal %, and 488.2 kcal % as saturated fat respectively, were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Metabolic parameters were measured up to 20 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopy was used to examine the structure of the pancreas, aorta and kidney </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Increased saturated fat consumption was associated with: (i) gradual imbalance of homeostasis, and severe structural alterations of acinar, beta cells and capillaries in the pancreas, and of the kidney glomeruli; (ii) severe hypertriglyceridaemia and augmented <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> concentrations related to disturbances of the renal function, progressing to nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000096'>glomerulosclerosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>; (iii) reduced early insulin secretion in response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>; (iv) switch of the aortic endothelium to a secretory phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: The results show that high-caloric saturated fat intake induced <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in hamsters, probably linked to delayed insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The model was also associated with the development of a range of pathologies characteristic to human <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> and defects in vasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, high-fat fed hamsters provide a new model that is likely to be useful in understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
