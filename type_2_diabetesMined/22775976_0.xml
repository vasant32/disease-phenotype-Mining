<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, monotherapy study was carried out in two parts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In part A, 32 patients received AZD1656 (7, 20, 40 or 80 mg) twice daily or placebo for 8 days in hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In part B, another 20 patients received, as outpatients, individually titrated AZD1656 15-45 mg twice daily or placebo for 28 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic variables were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: AZD1656 was generally well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pharmacokinetics of AZD1656 were virtually dose- and time-independent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>AZD1656 was rapidly absorbed and eliminated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An active metabolite was formed which had a longer half-life than AZD1656, but showed ∼15% of the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from 0 to 24 h compared with that of AZD1656 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Renal excretion of AZD1656 and the metabolite was low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In part A, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) was reduced by up to 21% and mean 24-h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was reduced by up to 24% with AZD1656 versus placebo, depending on dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No dose-related changes in serum insulin or C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> were observed with AZD1656 at the end of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Results in part B confirmed the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering effect of AZD1656 versus placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: AZD1656 was well tolerated with predictable pharmacokinetics in patients with T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Dose-dependent reductions in plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> were observed </plain></SENT>
