<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this article is to sum up the information so far available related to the biology of the beta-cell in the GK/Par rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In terms of beta-cell function, there is no major intrinsic secretory defect in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetic</z:e> GK/Par beta-cell, and the lack of beta-cell reactivity to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (which reflects multiple intracellular abnormalities), as seen during the adult period when the GK/Par rats are overtly diabetic, represents an acquired defect (perhaps glucotoxicity) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In terms of beta-cell population, the earliest alteration so far detected in the GK/Par rat targets the size of the beta-cell population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Several convergent data suggest that the permanently reduced beta-cell mass in the GK/Par rat reflects a limitation of beta-cell neogenesis during early fetal life, and it is conceivable that some genes among the set involved in GK <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> belong to the subset of genes controlling early beta-cell development </plain></SENT>
