<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By contrast, during aerobic exercise, the serum insulin concentration normally <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo>, with a rise in plasma glucagon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore assessed whether exenatide might predispose to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> during exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied eight non-diabetic men, who were 35.3 +/- 6.3 years of age with BMI of 24.7 +/- 1.7 kg/m(2) (mean +/- SD), using a randomised, crossover, double-blind design investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After an overnight fast, participants received 5 microg of subcutaneous exenatide or placebo and rested for 105 min before cycling at 60% of their maximal oxygen uptake (VO(2max)) for 75 min and then recovering for a further 60 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The insulin/glucagon molar ratio rose with exenatide at rest (p &lt; 0.01), then fell during exercise with placebo and with exenatide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At rest, fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> fell by approximately 1 mmol/l with exenatide to a nadir of 3.4 +/- 0.1 mmol/l (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During exercise, blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> fell with placebo but, unexpectedly, rose with exenatide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="47" ids="28918,33568">adrenaline</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi>), but not <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> concentrations increased to a greater extent during exercise after exenatide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No participant developed symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> and the lowest individual blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> recorded was 2.8 mmol/l with exenatide at 50 min in the pre-exercise period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In non-diabetic participants given exenatide, blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations rise rather than fall during aerobic exercise with an associated greater <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> response </plain></SENT>
