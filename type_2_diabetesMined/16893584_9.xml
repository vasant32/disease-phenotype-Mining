<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We also evaluated the variability of urinary albumin-to-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio (ACR) among the three measurements and the relationship between diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (DR) and <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The 1039 Chinese patients diagnosed with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> aged over 30 were investigated by randomized cluster sampling in the Shanghai downtown and 1018 patients were analyzed in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Body mass measurements including height, weight, waist circumference and hip circumference, resting blood pressure, fasting blood measures, urinary ACR and the digitally stored fundus images were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> was calculated and the risk factors associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> were evaluated by stepwise logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The concordance of urinary ACR was evaluated by observed agreement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relationship between <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> and DR was also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) The mean age of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients was 66.10+/-11.54 years and the duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 7.89+/-7.16 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>(2) The prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> was 49.6% among the Chinese patients diagnosed with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> aged over 30 in the Shanghai downtown, 41.4% with <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> and 8.2% with macroalbuminuria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>(3) <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>Microalbuminuria</z:mp> was significantly associated with systolic blood pressure, gender and waist circumference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Macroalbuminuria was significantly associated with systolic blood pressure and duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>(4) Observed agreement among the three urinary ACR measurement for <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> staging was 73.3% (first versus second), 64.5% (first versus third) and 77.5% (second versus third) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Observed agreement in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> staging between the single urinary ACR measurement and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three urinary ACR measurements was 85.8% (first versus <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three), 87.6% (second versus <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three) and 81.9% (third versus <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>(5) The percentage of DR in the macroalbuminuric group (59.2%) was significantly higher than that in the normalbuminuria group (16.1%) and <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> group (24.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>(6) The macroalbuminuric patients with DR had significantly increased fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and HbA1c compared with the macroalbuminuric patients without DR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> observed in the Chinese patients diagnosed with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> aged over 30 in the Shanghai downtown reached up to 41.4% though the observations in our study might be representative of the diabetic patients of the Shanghai downtown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>We agreed that at least two of the three urinary collections were done in a 3- to 6-month period because of the day-to-day variability in albumin excretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The percentage of DR among the patients with macroalbuminuria was 59.2%, and the macroalbuminuric patients with the significantly high plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and DR were prone to diagnose DN </plain></SENT>
