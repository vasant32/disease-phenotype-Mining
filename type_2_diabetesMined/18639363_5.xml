<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the thiazolidineone compound <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> could stimulate the circulating CD34(+) cells in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> received 15-30 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> for 24 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The number of circulating CD34(+) cells significantly increased at 12 and continued this effect for 24 weeks (1.08+/-0.39, 1.34+/-0.34 and 1.32+/-0.28cells/microl at 0, 12 and 24 weeks, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The change of CD34(+) cell levels (DeltaCD34(+) cells) between 0 and 12 weeks was significantly correlated with the change of high sensitive C reactive protein levels (Deltahs-CRP) and change in adiponectin levels (Deltaadiponectin) (r=-0.412, r=0.359, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our study demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> treatment increased circulating CD34(+) cells, suggesting that this effect may at least partly contribute to the anti-atherosclerotic action of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
