<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The contribution of gluconeogenesis (GNG) to endogenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> output (EGO) in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little information is available on the separate influence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> on GNG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We measured percent GNG (by the 2H2O technique) and EGO (by 6,6-[2H]<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>) in 37 type 2 diabetic subjects (9 lean and 28 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, mean fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> [FPG] 8.3 +/- 0.3 mmol/l) and 18 control subjects (6 lean and 12 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>) after a 15-h fast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Percent GNG averaged 47 +/- 5% in lean control subjects and was significantly increased in association with both <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.01) and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By multivariate analysis, percent GNG was independently associated with BMI (partial r = 0.27, P &lt; 0.05, with a predicted increase of 0.9% per BMI unit) and FPG (partial r = 0.44, P = 0.0009, with a predicted increase of 2.7% per mmol/l of FPG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, EGO was increased in both lean and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> diabetic subjects (15.6 +/- 0.5 micromol x min(-1) x kg(-1) of fat-free mass, n = 37, P = 0.002) but not in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> nondiabetic control subjects (13.1 0.7, NS) as compared with lean control subjects (12.4 +/- 1.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Consequently, gluconeogenic flux (percent GNG x EGO) was increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (P = 0.01) and markedly elevated in diabetic subjects (P = 0.0004), whereas glycogenolytic flux was reduced only in association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (P = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fasting plasma glucagon levels were significantly increased in diabetic subjects (P &lt; 0.05) and positively related to EGO, whereas plasma insulin was higher in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> control subjects than lean control subjects (P = 0.05) and unrelated to measured <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> fluxes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the percent contribution of GNG to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> release after a 15-h fast is independently and quantitatively related to the degree of overweight and the severity of fasting <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals, reduced glycogenolysis ensures a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rate of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> output </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In diabetic individuals, hyperglucagonemia contributes to inappropriately elevated rates of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> output from both GNG and glycogenolysis </plain></SENT>
