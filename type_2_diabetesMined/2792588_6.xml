<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These data, plus evidence of a high prevalence of Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> in American Indians and mixed populations, such as Mexican-Americans, which is only partially attributable to the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in these populations, makes it imperative that the nature of such associations be clarified in relation to genetic susceptibility to Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present paper reports the results of tests of association between Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and seven polymorphic markers: the blood groups - ABO, Rhesus, Duffy and Kell (K and KP) - haptoglobin and group specific component; among Anglo and Hispanic populations in the San Luis Valley of Colorado, USA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The sample population consisted of 788 individuals of which 398 were Anglo subjects (97 Types 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> patients and 301 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals) and 390 Hispanic subjects (191 Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> patients and 199 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Association between Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and genetic markers in patients was tested using the G2 statistic within each ethnic class using <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> frequencies as a comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results of the tests indicated that only the Kell blood group was significantly associated with Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> at a 5% level among the Anglo subjects (G2 = 5.16, 1df) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This significant value can be explained by chance alone, if multiple comparisons are taken into account </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our tests have not shown the previously reported haptoglobin or Rhesus blood group associations seen in Mexican-Americans in San Antonio, Texas </plain></SENT>
