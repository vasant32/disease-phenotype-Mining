<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Little of the genetic basis for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> has been explained, despite numerous genetic linkage studies and the discovery of multiple genes in genome-wide association (GWA) studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To begin to resolve the genetic component of this disease, we searched for sites at which genetic results had been corroborated in different studies, in the expectation that replication among studies should direct us to the genomic locations of causative genes with more confidence than the results of individual studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We have mapped the physical location of results from 83 linkage reports (for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> precursor quantitative traits [QTs, e.g. plasma insulin levels]) and recent large GWA reports (for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) onto the same human genome sequence to identify replicated results in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> genetic 'hot spots' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Genetic linkage has been found at least ten times at 18 different locations, and at least five times in 56 locations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> replication clusters contained study populations from more than one ethnic background and most contained results for both <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and QTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There is no close relationship between the GWA results and linkage clusters, and the nine best replication clusters have no nearby GWA result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Many of the genes for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> remain unidentified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This analysis identifies the broad location of yet to be identified genes on 6q, 1q, 18p, 2q, 20q, 17pq, 8p, 19q and 9q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The discrepancy between the linkage and GWA studies may be explained by the presence of multiple, uncommon, mildly deleterious polymorphisms scattered throughout the regulatory and coding regions of genes for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
