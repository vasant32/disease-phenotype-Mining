<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This 38-month open, randomized, prospective study enrolled 536 subjects (HbA1c 9.4+/-0.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into three groups including continual insulin injection (I), continual secretagogue administration (S) and alternation of two-month insulin injection and four-month secretagogue treatment (A) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At baseline and every three months, HbA1c was measured and a standard bread meal test (100g) was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HbA1c were better controlled in both groups I and A than in S (6.9+/-0.3%, 6.8+/-0.3% vs. 7.6+/-0.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>Hypoglycemia</z:hpo> incidence was much lower in group A than that in I (0.8 times/patient/month vs. 2.4 times/patient/month) also with less <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> (1.6 kg vs. 2.8 kg/patient/year) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From the standard bread meal test, patients in group A got the greatest increment of 2-h C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Inquiry from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects showed that alternate strategy was welcomed by most of them considering for convenience and efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Alternate insulin-secretagogue treatment can effectively reduce HbA1c and help to improve islet function with reduced risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> under good compliance </plain></SENT>
