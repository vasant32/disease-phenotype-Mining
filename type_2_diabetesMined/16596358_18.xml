<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twelve people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> took part in two 24-h isoglycaemic clamp studies, 1 week apart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomised to treatment with 0.5 U/kg of BIAsp 30 (0.25 U/kg at 08.30 h and 0.25 U/kg at 20.30 h) or 0.50 U/kg IGlarg at 08.30 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both insulins were given by subcutaneous injection into the anterior abdominal wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion rates, plasma insulin and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> concentrations were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 12 patients were men; mean (+/-SD) age was 58.8 (8.9) years, BMI 31.0 (3.0) kg/m2 and HbA(1c) 7.1 (0.6)% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was constant throughout the 24-h clamp period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After each injection of BIAsp 30, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion rates increased, reaching a distinct peak approximately 3-5 h after injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A much flatter postinjection profile was observed following IGlarg administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Plasma insulin concentrations rose rapidly after each injection of BIAsp 30, reaching a distinct peak after approximately 2-3 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A flatter plasma insulin profile reached a plateau approximately 6-16 h after IGlarg administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Plasma C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> fell below baseline after both injections of BIAsp 30 but remained unaltered after IGlarg injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles were 34 and 28%, respectively, higher following equivalent doses (0.5 U/kg) of BIAsp 30 given as two split doses than following IGlarg given as a single daily dose </plain></SENT>
