<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: In patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but not type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, abnormal secretion of incretins in response to oral nutrients has been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In healthy youths, we recently reported accentuated glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> 1 (GLP-1) secretion in response to a diet soda sweetened with sucralose and acesulfame-K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the effect of diet soda on gut hormones in youths with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Subjects aged 12-25 years with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 9) or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 10), or healthy control participants (n = 25) drank 240 mL cola-flavored <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi>-free diet soda or carbonated water, followed by a 75-g <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> load, in a randomized, cross-over design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi>, C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, GLP-1, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent insulinotropic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (GIP), and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> Tyr-Tyr (PYY) were measured for 180 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> and GLP-1 have previously been reported for the healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: GLP-1 area under the curve (AUC) was 43% higher after ingestion of diet soda versus carbonated water in individuals with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P = 0.020), similar to control subjects (34% higher, P = 0.029), but was unaffected by diet soda in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P = 0.92) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi>, C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, GIP, and PYY AUC were not statistically different between the two conditions in any group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Ingestion of diet soda before a <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> load augmented GLP-1 secretion in type 1 diabetic and control subjects but not type 2 diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>GIP and PYY secretion were not affected by diet soda </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The clinical significance of this increased GLP-1 secretion, and its absence in youths with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, needs to be determined </plain></SENT>
