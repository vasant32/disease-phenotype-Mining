<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Inherited variation in this pathway could influence susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and its complications, including type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We genotyped a set of 71 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that capture the most common variation in NPY, PPY, PYY, NPY1R, NPY2R, and NPY5R in 2,800 individuals of recent European ancestry drawn from the near extremes of BMI distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five SNPs located upstream of NPY2R were nominally associated with BMI in men (P values = 0.001-0.009, odds ratios [ORs] 1.27-1.34) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No association with BMI was observed in women, and no consistent associations were observed for other genes in this pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We attempted to replicate the association with BMI in 2,500 men and tested these SNPs for association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in 8,000 samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We observed association with BMI in men in only one replication sample and saw no association in the combined replication samples (P = 0.154, OR = 1.09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, a 9% haplotype was associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in men (P = 1.73 x 10(-4), OR = 1.36) and not in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Variation in this pathway likely does not have a major influence on BMI, although small effects cannot be ruled out; NPY2R should be considered a candidate gene for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in men </plain></SENT>
