<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the Study on Lifestyle Intervention and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>Impaired Glucose Tolerance</z:hpo> Maastricht (SLIM), 97 men and women with IGT were randomised to a combined diet and exercise programme (47 intervention) or a control group (50 control subjects) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At baseline and after 1 year the following assessments were made: an OGTT, an exercise test to determine maximal aerobic capacity, anthropometry, and analysis of the serum fatty acid profile of cholesteryl <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">esters</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The lifestyle programme was effective in reducing the intake of total and saturated fat, increasing physical activity, reducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and improving insulin sensitivity and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regression analysis of the total population showed that an increase in the C20:4 n-6/C20:3 n-6 ratio (estimated Delta5-desaturase activity) and reductions in the C18:3 n-6/C18:2 n-6 ratio (estimated Delta6-desaturase activity) and the C16:1 n-7/C16:0 ratio (estimated Delta9-desaturase activity or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15541">stearoyl-CoA</z:chebi> desaturase-1) were significantly associated with a decrease in homeostasis model assessment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for lifestyle changes (change in percentage body fat, aerobic capacity and saturated fat intake), these associations were partly reduced, but remained statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Lifestyle-induced changes in fatty acid profile of cholesteryl <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">esters</z:chebi> and desaturase activities were independently related to changes in insulin sensitivity in subjects at risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
