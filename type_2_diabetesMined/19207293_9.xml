<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Elevated ferritin levels are associated with increased DM risk among healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it is yet unknown if ferritin predicts DM incidence among high-risk individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the association between soluble transferrin receptors (sTfR), a novel marker of iron status, and DM risk has not yet been prospectively investigated in these individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conducted this study to evaluate the association between baseline levels of ferritin and sTfR and the risk of developing DM among overweight and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals at high risk of DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This nested case-control study (280 cases and 280 matched controls) was conducted within the placebo arm of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Prevention Program, is a clinical trial conducted among overweight/<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals with IGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ferritin and sTfR levels were measured by immunoturbidimetric assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Incident DM was ascertained by annual 75-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test and semi-annual fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with controls, cases had higher sTfR levels (3.50 +/- 0.07 vs. 3.30 +/- 0.06 mg/l; p = 0.03), but ferritin levels were not statistically different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The multivariable odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for DM incidence comparing highest with the lowest quartiles of sTfR was 2.26 (1.37-4.01) (p-trend: 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Modestly elevated sTfR levels are associated with increased DM risk among overweight and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals with IGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Future studies should evaluate factors determining sTfR levels and examine if interventions that lower body iron stores reduce DM incidence </plain></SENT>
