<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Look AHEAD is a multicenter randomized controlled trial of 5,145 overweight or <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, aged 45-76 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) involving group and individual meetings to achieve and maintain <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> through decreased caloric intake and increased physical activity was compared with a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> support and education (DSE) condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Medications prescribed to treat <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> were compared at baseline and 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Medication costs were conservatively estimated using prices from a national online pharmacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Participants randomized to an ILI had significantly greater improvements in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk parameters and reduced medication use and cost compared with those assigned to DSE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 1 year, average number of medications prescribed to treat <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk factors was 3.1 +/- 1.8 for the ILI group and 3.6 +/- 1.8 for the DSE group (P &lt; 0.0001), with estimated total monthly medication costs of $143 and $173, respectively (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DSE participants meeting optimal care goals at 1 year were taking an average of 3.8 +/- 1.6 medications at an estimated cost of $194/month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ILI participants at optimal care required fewer medications (3.2 +/- 1.7) at lower cost ($154/month) (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: At 1 year, ILI significantly improved <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk factors, while at the same time reduced medication use and cost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Continued intervention and follow-up will determine whether these changes are maintained and reduce cardiovascular risk </plain></SENT>
