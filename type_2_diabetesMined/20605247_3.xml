<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A case-control study included 36 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 10 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>According to the levels of carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), 36 diabetic patients were classified into two groups, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (DM-AS, n=20) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (DM+AS, n=16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excursions were assessed by the following parameters obtained from continuous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring system for 72h: the mean blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (MBG) and its standard deviation (SD), the area under the ROC curve when the blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was higher than 7.8mmol/L (AUC7.8), the mean amplitude of glycemic excursion (MAGE), the mean of daily differences (MODD), and the largest amplitude of glycemic excursion (LAGE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The levels of MBG, SD, MAGE, LAGE, and AUC7.8 were gradually increased with the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Spearman's correlation analysis showed that the CIMT was correlated to the age (R=0.58, P&lt;0.001), the duration (R=0.50, P&lt;0.001), the MAGE (R=0.34, P=0.021), and the LAGE (R=0.31, P=0.035) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> fluctuations may accelerate atherogenesis in older type 2 diabetic patients who had a longer duration </plain></SENT>
