<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study analyzes the effect of long-term exposure to high insulin levels on insulin-insulin receptor metabolism in human myoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cells were grown in the presence of low (107 pM, SkMC-L) or high (1430 pM, SkMC-H) insulin concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Insulin receptor (IR) phosphorylation, IR internalization, dissociation and recycling, as well as insulin degradation have been investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Basal IR phosphorylation was higher in SkMC-H than in SkMC-L (P&lt;0.01) but after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin stimulation (10nM insulin for 10 min), IR phosphorylation increased (P&lt;0.01) in SkMC-L, but not in SkMC-H </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002079'>hyperinsulinism</z:mp> significantly decreased insulin-IR complex internalization (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless the t(1/2) value of receptor internalization was similar in both cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intracellular dissociation of insulin-IR complex was slightly but significantly lower in SkMC-H than in SkMC-L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, SkMC-H showed a complete, but significantly delayed recycling of IR to plasma membrane (t(1/2)=20 min versus SkMC-L t(1/2)=7 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The time course of intracellular degradation measured by HPLC, showed whenever studied, significantly (P&lt;0.01) higher levels of intracellular intact insulin in cells exposed to high insulin concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the patterns of insulin degradation were over-imposable between SkMC-H and SkMC-L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In summary, continuous exposure of cultured myoblasts to high insulin levels induces subtle derangements of intracellular receptor trafficking and insulin degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These alterations may contribute to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> of hyperinsulinemic states such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
