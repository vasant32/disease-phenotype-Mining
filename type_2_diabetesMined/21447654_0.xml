<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In young subjects, infusion of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> and ATP increases blood flow, and the latter compound also attenuates α-adrenergic vasoconstriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and age-matched healthy subjects, we tested 1) the sympatholytic capacity during one-legged exercise, 2) the vasodilatory capacity of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> and ATP, and 3) the ability to blunt α-adrenergic vasoconstriction during ATP infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In 10 control subjects and 10 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> endothelial function, determined by leg blood flow (LBF) response to <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> infusion, we measured LBF and venous NA, with and without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15760">tyramine</z:chebi>-induced sympathetic vasoconstriction, during <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi>-, ATP-, and exercise-induced hyperemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: LBF during <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> did not differ significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LBF increased ninefold during exercise and during <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi>- and ATP-induced hyperemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Infusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15760">tyramine</z:chebi> during exercise did not reduce LBF in either the control or the patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During combined ATP and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15760">tyramine</z:chebi> infusions, LBF decreased by 30% in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">Adenosine</z:chebi> had no sympatholytic effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> endothelial function, functional sympatholysis was intact during moderate exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The vasodilatory response for <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> and ATP did not differ between the patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the control subjects; however, the vasodilatory effect of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> and ATP and the sympatholytic effect of ATP seem to decline with age </plain></SENT>
