<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Amylin is a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> of 37 amino acids, predominantly synthesized in pancreatic Beta cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> was suggested to be dysregulated in Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and it antagonized certain actions of insulin in vitro in rat muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This led to speculation that amylin is involved in the pathogenesis of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have examined the in vivo effects of rat amylin, amidated at the carboxy-terminus, on insulin-mediated carbohydrate metabolism in conscious rats, using the hyperinsulinaemic (+/- 1 nmol/l) euglycaemic (6 mmol/l) clamp technique combined with [3-3H]-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Basal plasma amylin levels were less than or equal to 75 pmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Applied amylin levels of 220 +/- 75 pmol/l (infusion rate of 12.5 pmol/min) antagonized only the insulin action on liver, resulting in a 100% increase of hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> output </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Amylin levels of 4750 +/- 750 pmol/l (infusion rate of 125 pmol/min) induced a 250% increase of insulin-inhibited hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> output and, in addition, a 30% decrease of insulin-stimulated peripheral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> up-take </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Amylin did not affect: 1) the metabolic clearance rate of insulin, 2) the levels of plasma glucagon, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16827">corticosterone</z:chebi>, 3) in vitro insulin binding and insulin-stimulated receptor autophosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This suggests that amylin antagonizes insulin action via binding to a yet unknown receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion: amylin causes in vivo <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and the liver seems the predominant organ regulated by this hormone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The in vivo effects of amylin mimic the pathophysiological abnormalities of insulin action in Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
