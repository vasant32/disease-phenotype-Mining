<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Equations for forecasting the occurrence of seven <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related complications and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were estimated using data on 3642 patients from the United Kingdom Prospective <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study (UKPDS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After examining the internal validity, the UKPDS Outcomes Model was used to simulate the mean difference in expected quality-adjusted life years between the UKPDS regimens of intensive and conventional blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The model's forecasts fell within the 95% confidence interval for the occurrence of observed events during the UKPDS follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When the model was used to simulate event history over patients' lifetimes, those treated with a regimen of conventional <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control could expect 16.35 undiscounted quality-adjusted life years, and those receiving treatment with intensive <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control could expect 16.62 quality-adjusted life years, a difference of 0.27 (95% CI: -0.48 to 1.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATIONS: The UKPDS Outcomes Model is able to simulate event histories that closely match observed outcomes in the UKPDS and that can be extrapolated over patients' lifetimes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Its validity in estimating outcomes in other groups of patients, however, remains to be evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The model allows simulation of a range of long-term outcomes, which should assist in informing future economic evaluations of interventions in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
