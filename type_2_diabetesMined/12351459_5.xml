<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An association between type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and genetic variation in the KIR6.2 gene has been reported in several populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on in vitro studies with cell lines expressing the Glu(23)Lys (E23K) mutation, it was recently suggested that this mutation might result in altered insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have examined <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion in relation to this KIR6.2 gene variant in two independent Dutch cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (n = 65) or impaired (n = 94) <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance underwent 3-h hyperglycemic clamps at 10 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We did not observe significant differences in first- or second-phase insulin secretion between carriers and noncarriers of the gene variant in either of the study populations (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &gt; 0.45) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we found no evidence for a significant interaction with disease-associated gene variants in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> receptor (SUR1) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the E23K mutation in the KIR6.2 gene is not associated with detectable alterations in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion in two independent populations from the Netherlands </plain></SENT>
