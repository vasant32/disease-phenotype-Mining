<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Appropriate methodology (PRISMA statement) was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixty-seven randomized studies, published as full papers were analysed to identify predictors of both HbA1c and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e>; studies were included in a meta-analysis to study the effect of different insulin regimens or insulin analogues on HbA1c and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> during the first year of insulin treatment in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Final HbA1c, change of HbA1c, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e>, nocturnal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> and severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> were associated with intensity of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Final HbA1c was higher with basal than with twice-a-day or prandial, and with twice-a-day than with prandial regimen, with opposite figures for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Within basal regimens, detemir and glargine were similar to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin on HbA1c, with less <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> and nocturnal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e>; within prandial regimens, new analogues were more effective than regular insulin on HbA1c, and induced less <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effect of glargine on HbA1c and on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> vanished with increasing number of insulin injections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Metabolic control and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> are associated with intensity of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Basal regimens have a reduced effect on metabolic control, but are associated with lower frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Newer analogues, short- and long-acting, yield better control and less <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> than older analogues </plain></SENT>
