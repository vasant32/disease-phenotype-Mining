<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Circulating endothelial cells (CECs) have been reported to be an ex vivo indicator of vascular injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the presence of CECs in the peripheral blood of 25 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and in nine non-diabetic control donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Endothelial cells were isolated from peripheral blood with anti-CD-146-coated immunomagnetic Dynabeads, and were stained with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51739">acridine orange</z:chebi> dye and counted by fluorescence microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cells were also stained for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor and Ulex europaeus lectin 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> had an elevated number of CECs (mean 69+/-30 cells/ml, range 35-126) compared with healthy controls (mean 10+/-5 cells/ml, range 3-18) (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The increase in CECs did not correlate with the levels of HbA(1)c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Circulating endothelial cell numbers were elevated regardless of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, suggesting that, even with control of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, there is increased endothelial cell sloughing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the higher number of CECs in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may reflect ongoing vascular injury that is not directly dependent on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control </plain></SENT>
