<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Mutations in the HNF1A gene are the most common cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004904'>maturity-onset diabetes of the young</z:hpo> (MODY) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is a substantial variation in the age at <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosis, even within families where <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is caused by the same mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the hypothesis that common polygenic variants that predispose to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> might account for the difference in age at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Fifteen robustly associated type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> variants were successfully genotyped in 410 individuals from 203 HNF1A-MODY families, from two study centers in the U.K. and Norway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We assessed their effect on the age at diagnosis both individually and in a combined genetic score by summing the number of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk alleles carried by each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We confirmed the effects of environmental and genetic factors known to modify the age at HNF1A-MODY diagnosis, namely intrauterine <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> (-5.1 years if present, P = 1.6 x 10(-10)) and HNF1A mutation position (-5.2 years if at least two isoforms affected, P = 1.8 x 10(-2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, our data showed strong effects of sex (females diagnosed 3.0 years earlier, P = 6.0 x 10(-4)) and age at study (0.3 years later diagnosis per year increase in age, P = 4.7 x 10(-38)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no strong individual single nucleotide polymorphism effects; however, in the combined genetic score model, each additional risk allele was associated with 0.35 years earlier <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosis (P = 5.1 x 10(-3)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We show that type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk variants of modest effect sizes reduce the age at diagnosis in HNF1A-MODY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This is one of the first studies to demonstrate that clinical characteristics of a monogenic disease can be modified by common polygenic variants </plain></SENT>
