<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While the underlying mechanisms generating these oscillations are not fully established, increasing evidence suggests a central role for phosphofructo-1-kinase/muscle subtype (PFK1-M), which also serves as the predominantly active PFK1 subtype in the pancreatic beta-cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The fact that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> oscillatory secretion is impaired in subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> and healthy relatives of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> suggests that this defect may be involved in the secretory dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To evaluate a possible link between inherited PFK1-M deficiency in humans (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017926" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GSD7">Tarui's disease</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017926" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GSD7">glycogenosis type VII</z:e>) and altered insulin oscillations, in vivo studies were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We determined basal insulin oscillations during 2 h of frequent plasma sampling in two related teen-aged individuals with homozygous and heterozygous PFK1-M deficiency compared with nondeficient, unrelated control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As predicted by the underlying hypothesis, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> oscillations in insulin secretion were completely abolished in the individual with homozygous deficiency of PFK1-M and significantly impaired in the heterozygous individual, as shown by spectral density and autocorrelation analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, deficiency of PFK1-M subtype in humans appears to be associated with an impaired oscillatory insulin secretion pattern and may contribute to the commonly observed secretion defects occurring in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
