<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> is the most commonly prescribed oral agent used in the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is effective at reducing glycosylated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">Haemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA1c) and decreasing microvascular and macrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, up to 25% of patients develop gastrointestinal side effects leading to cessation in 5-10% of users </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> XL (glucophage SR) is a once a day preparation that delays absorption, leading to decreased peak <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We hypothesised that the XL preparation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> would be better tolerated than the standard immediate release (IR) preparation leading to improved adherence to therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a retrospective observational study, we studied adherence and glycaemic control in patients prescribed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> IR and XL preparations in Tayside, UK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> XL was used by 137 patients during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall adherence was greater in the XL group (80%) compared with the 10,772 patients in the IR group (72%, p = 0.0026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the 40 patients who changed from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> IR to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> XL who had sufficient data to determine adherence, the adherence increased from 62% in the IR group to 81% in the XL group (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This was associated with an HbA1c reduction from 9.1 to 8.4% (p = 0.0739, n = 29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> XL use is associated with increased adherence compared with the IR preparation, although the mechanism for this cannot be determined from this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In patients intolerant of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> IR the XL preparation should be considered </plain></SENT>
