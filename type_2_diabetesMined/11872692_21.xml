<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The hormone resistin has been suggested to link <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by modulating steps in the insulin-signaling pathway and inducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, the resistin gene represents a potential candidate for the etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we analyzed the coding sequence of the three exons of the resistin gene, together with its 5' regulatory region and 3' untranslated region (UTR), by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) in 58 type 2 diabetic subjects, 59 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects, and 60 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only one sequence variant was detected in the resistin gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sequencing of this variant revealed the presence of a single nucleotide substitution (SNP) in the 3'-UTR of exon 3 (G1326A) [corrected] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because 3'-UTR SNPs have been shown to affect gene expression, we examined the frequency of this SNP in 591 subjects (198 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects, 207 diabetic subjects, and 186 control subjects) by PCR amplification and BseRI digestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant association was found between the G1326A [corrected] variant and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Comparison of clinical and metabolic parameters between G1326A [corrected] carriers and noncarriers again showed no significant difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our data suggest that genetic defects of the resistin gene are unlikely to play a role in the etiology of these common disorders in our population </plain></SENT>
