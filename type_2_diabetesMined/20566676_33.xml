<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin in treatment-naive patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a 24-week parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with A1C 7.0-10% (n = 485) were randomly assigned to one of seven arms to receive once-daily placebo or 2.5, 5, or 10 mg dapagliflozin once daily in the morning (main cohort) or evening (exploratory cohort) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with A1C 10.1-12% (high-A1C exploratory cohort; n = 73) were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive blinded treatment with a morning dose of 5 or 10 mg/day dapagliflozin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was change from baseline in A1C in the main cohort, statistically tested using an ANCOVA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the main cohort, mean A1C changes from baseline at week 24 were -0.23% with placebo and -0.58, -0.77 (P = 0.0005 vs. placebo), and -0.89% (P &lt; 0.0001 vs. placebo) with 2.5, 5, and 10 mg dapagliflozin, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Signs, symptoms, and other reports suggestive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000010'>urinary tract infections</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0729552" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genital infection</z:e> were more frequently noted in the dapagliflozin arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no major episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Data from exploratory cohorts were consistent with these results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Dapagliflozin lowered <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> in treatment-naive patients with newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The near absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> and an insulin-independent mechanism of action make dapagliflozin a unique addition to existing treatment options for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
