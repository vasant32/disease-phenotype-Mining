<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CART is also expressed in <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> cells, including beta-cells during rat development and delta-cells of adult rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the effect of CART 55-102 on islet hormone secretion, using INS-1(832/13) cells and isolated rat islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, islet CART expression was examined in two rat models of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>: Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> (DEX)-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, CART potentiated cAMP-enhanced insulin secretion via the cAMP/protein kinase A-dependent pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the absence of cAMP-elevating agents, CART was without effect on INS-1 cells but modestly inhibited secretion of insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin from isolated islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CART was markedly upregulated in the beta-cells of both <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, in DEX-treated rats, islet CART <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression, and the number of CART-immunoreactive beta-cells were 10-fold higher than in control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In GK rats, the relative number of CART-expressing beta-cells was 30-fold higher than in control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that CART is a regulator of islet hormone secretion and that CART is upregulated in the beta-cells of type 2 diabetic rats </plain></SENT>
