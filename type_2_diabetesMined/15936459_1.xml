<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this point of view, we determined the transcriptional start site of the human BTC gene and screened the protein-coding region for mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The transcriptional start site was located 347 bp upstream from the translational initiation codon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After screening the protein coding exons (exons 1-5), we identified two novel missense mutations, Cys (TGC) to Gly (GGC) at codon 7 (C7G) and Leu (TTG) to Met (ATG) at codon 124 (L124M), and a single nucleotide substitution (-31c/t) in the intron 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The C7G was located in the signal <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> and the L124M in the transmembrane domain and this Leu at codon 124 was conserved among human, bovine, rat, and mouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of these variants, however, were similar between type 2 diabetic patients (n = 228) and non-diabetic control subjects (n = 170) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that genetic variations in the protein-coding region of the human BTC gene are unlikely to be a major contributor to development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
