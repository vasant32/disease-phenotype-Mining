<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Postchallenge <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> (PCH) is known to contribute to suboptimal glycemic control in adults with non-insulin-requiring type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of PCH among individuals with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988-1994) in adults aged 40-74 years with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were not using insulin (i.e., they used oral hypoglycemics or received no pharmacological therapy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each respondent underwent a standard 75-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PCH was defined as a 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level &gt;or=200 mg/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, PCH was present in 74% of those with diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although it was present in virtually <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> (99%) of the diabetic adults under suboptimal glycemic control (HbA(1c) &gt;or=7.0%), PCH was also common (39%) among those under optimal control (HbA(1c) &lt;7.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Likewise, among <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> users, PCH was present in 99% of those under suboptimal control and in 63% of those under good control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similar patterns were observed in those with undiagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Isolated PCH (2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &gt;or=200 mg/dl and fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &lt;126 mg/dl) was present in 9.8% of the adults with diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that PCH is common among diabetic adults in the U.S., even in the setting of "optimal" glycemic control and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Interventions designed to lower postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excursions may help improve overall glycemic control in the general population of U.S. adults with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
