<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Knowledge of one's actual and target health outcomes (such as HbA(1c) values) is hypothesized to be a prerequisite for effective patient involvement in managing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> diseases such as <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined 1) the frequency and correlates of knowing one's most recent HbA(1c) test result and 2) whether knowing one's HbA(1c) value is associated with a more accurate assessment of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> control and better <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-care understanding, self-efficacy, and behaviors related to glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of a sample of 686 U.S. adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in five health systems who had HbA(1c) checked in the previous 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Independent variables included patient characteristics, health care provider communication, and health system type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We examined bivariate and multivariate associations between each variable and the respondents' knowledge of their last HbA(1c) values and assessed whether knowledge of HbA(1c) was associated with key <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care attitudes and behaviors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the respondents, 66% reported that they did not know their last HbA(1c) value and only 25% accurately reported that value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analyses, more years of formal education and high evaluations of provider thoroughness of communication were independently associated with HbA(1c) knowledge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Respondents who knew their last HbA(1c) value had higher odds of accurately assessing their <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> control (adjusted odds ratio 1.59, 95% CI 1.05-2.42) and better reported understanding of their <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HbA(1c) knowledge was not associated with respondents' <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care self-efficacy or reported self-management behaviors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Respondents who knew their HbA(1c) values reported better <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care understanding and assessment of their glycemic control than those who did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Knowledge of one's HbA(1c) level alone, however, was not sufficient to translate increased understanding of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care into the increased confidence and motivation necessary to improve patients' <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Strategies to provide information to patients must be combined with other behavioral strategies to motivate and help patients effectively manage their <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
