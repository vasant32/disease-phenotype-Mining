<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We experienced a case of fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> probably due to maternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> following the interruption of insulin therapy in a woman with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> mellitus (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e>), probably undiagnosed type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 27-year-old Japanese woman was referred to our center because of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> at 15 weeks of gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During the course of her educational admission, diet control and insulin therapy resulted in favorable blood sugar levels and she was discharged at 17 weeks of gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During these periods, fetal growth remained below average at between -1 and -1.5 S.D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After a check-up in the 29th week, she failed to appear for any further appointments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of labor, at 38 weeks of gestation, she suddenly consulted her former physician who delivered a baby weighing 4852g by cesarean section on the 38th week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A noteworthy point in this case is the growth curve of the fetus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Even if rapid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> is assumed, starting after the time of interruption of insulin at 30 weeks of gestation, fetal <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> appears to be about 400g per week, suggesting a weight increase at twice the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This case prompted us to keep in mind that rigid glycemic control will prevent the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001520'>fetal macrosomia</z:hpo> in diabetic pregnant women </plain></SENT>
