<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: These analyses were undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of the insulin sensitizer <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> (RSG) when added to the therapy of <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> patients (T2DM) taking near-maximal doses (2.5 g/day) of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (MET) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, insulin-resistant patients with T2DM who are inadequately controlled on MET, the addition of an agent that reduces <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> may be a more rational and innovative approach than the addition of an insulin secretagogue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were pooled from two double-blind studies of RSG added to 2.5 g/day MET, involving a total of 550 T2DM patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were categorized as non-overweight, overweight and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> according to their baseline BMI using WHO criteria (&lt;25 kgm(-2), 25-30 kgm(-2), &gt;30 kgm(-2) respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: RSG improved glycaemia (HbA1c) and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) to a clinically significant extent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three subgroups but the effect was most pronounced in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Improvements in HOMA estimates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and beta-cell function were also greatest in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients (4 mg: -16% and +19%; 8 mg: -37% and + 33% respectively), as were reductions in fasting insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The profile of adverse events was not demonstrably different in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients from the non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> type 2 diabetic patients inadequately controlled on MET alone, addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> improves glycaemic control, insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function to a clinically important extent </plain></SENT>
