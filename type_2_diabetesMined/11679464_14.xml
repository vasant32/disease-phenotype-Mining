<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Female patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, poorly controlled <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, and HbA(1c) &gt;8% were randomly assigned to one of two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition to their prescribed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi> (maximum doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>), one group (n = 30) received a placebo twice daily for 6 months and the other (n = 30) received sibutramine 10 mg b.i.d. for the same period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One patient in the sibutramine group was excluded during the study period because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>; thus, a total of 29 data sets were analyzed for this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the placebo group, five patients had to be excluded because of low treatment efficacy, leaving a total of 25 who completed the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparing the changes that occurred over 6 months in the sibutramine and placebo groups, the former showed significantly greater reductions in fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.0001), second-hour postprandial blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.0001), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.0001), waist circumference (P &lt; 0.0001), BMI (P &lt; 0.0001), HbA(1c) (P &lt; 0.0001), diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> levels, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> elements of the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile except <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> A1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The addition of sibutramine to oral hypoglycemic therapy resulted in significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and improvement in metabolic parameters in this patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sibutramine is an effective adjunct to oral hypoglycemic therapy in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
