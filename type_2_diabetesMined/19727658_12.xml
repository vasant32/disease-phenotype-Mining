<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This research was conducted as part of the Dutch Contribution to the European Prospective Investigation into <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> and Nutrition, which involves a prospective cohort of 40,011 participants with a mean follow-up of 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A validated food-frequency questionnaire was used to assess coffee and tea consumption and other lifestyle and dietary factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The main outcome was verified incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure, <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> were examined as possible mediating factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During follow-up, 918 incident cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for potential confounders, coffee and tea consumption were both inversely associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, with hazard ratios of 0.77 (95% CI 0.63-0.95) for 4.1-6.0 cups of coffee per day (p for trend = 0.033) and 0.63 (95% CI: 0.47-0.86) for &gt;5.0 cups of tea per day (p for trend = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Total daily consumption of at least three cups of coffee and/or tea reduced the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by approximately 42% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adjusting for blood pressure, <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi> did not attenuate the associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Drinking coffee or tea is associated with a lowered risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, which cannot be explained by <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi> or blood pressure effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Total consumption of at least three cups of coffee or tea per day may lower the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
