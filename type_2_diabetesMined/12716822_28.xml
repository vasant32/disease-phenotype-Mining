<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, aerobic exercise is hindered in many type 2 diabetic patients because of advancing age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and other comorbid conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Weight lifting or progressive resistance training (PRT) offers a safe and effective exercise alternative for these people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PRT promotes favorable energy balance and reduced visceral fat deposition through enhanced basal metabolism and activity levels while counteracting age- and disease-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0003202'>muscle wasting</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PRT improves insulin sensitivity and glycemic control; increases muscle mass, strength, and endurance; and has positive effects on bone density, osteoarthritic symptoms, mobility impairment, self-efficacy, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PRT also alleviates symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100785'>insomnia</z:hpo> in individuals with clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and improves exercise tolerance in individuals with cardiac ischemic disease and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these aspects are relevant to the care of diabetic elders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, PRT is safe and well accepted in many complex patient populations, including very frail elderly individuals and those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The greater feasibility of using PRT over aerobic exercise in elderly <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> type 2 diabetic individuals because of concomitant cardiovascular, arthritic, and other disease provides a solid rationale for investigating the global benefits of PRT in the management of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
