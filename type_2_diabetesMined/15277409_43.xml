<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> low-glycemic index (LGI) diet, compared with a high-glycemic index (HGI) diet, has beneficial effects on plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism, total fat mass, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Twelve type 2 diabetic men were randomly allocated to two periods of 4 weeks of an LGI or HGI carbohydrate diet separated by a 4-week washout interval, in a crossover design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The LGI diet induced lower postprandial plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin profiles and areas under the curve than after the HGI diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the end of the two dietary periods, the 7-day dietary records demonstrated equal daily total energy and macronutrient intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Body weight and total fat mass were comparable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four-week LGI versus HGI diet induced improvement of fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.01, Delta changes during LGI vs. HGI), HbA(1c) (P &lt; 0.01), and whole-body <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization measured by the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LGI diet induced a decrease in fasting plasma total and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (Delta changes LGI vs. HGI, P &lt; 0.01), free fatty acids (P &lt; 0.01), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B, and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Only 4 weeks of an LGI diet was able to improve glycemic control, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization, some <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profiles, and the capacity for fibrinolysis in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Even if changes in glycemic control were modest during the 4-week period, the use of an LGI diet in a longer-term manner might play an important role in the treatment and prevention of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and related disorders </plain></SENT>
