<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nine T2DM patients and nine age-matched healthy men (CON) performed a sustained isometric knee extension at 10% of maximal voluntary contraction for 120s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multi-channel SEMG was recorded from the vastus lateralis muscle by means of 64 electrodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To characterize spatial SEMG potential distribution pattern, modified entropy and correlation coefficients between same electrode locations were calculated at 15, 60 and 120s for the root mean square values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At 60 and 120s, modified entropy in T2DM was significantly lower than those in CON (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Correlation coefficients for T2DM were significantly higher than those for CON at 60 and 120s (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: From these results, we suggested that T2DM patients continue to recruit limited and same motor units during the sustained contraction at low force level </plain></SENT>
