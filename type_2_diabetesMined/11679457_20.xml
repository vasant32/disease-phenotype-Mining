<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine weight changes occurring before and after the diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the association of these changes with treatment and microvascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We undertook an analysis of serial examinations conducted between 1965 and 2000 in residents of the Gila River Community in Central Arizona </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data were taken from 4,226 examinations of 816 individuals in whom <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> developed over the course of a longitudinal study and who had undergone a nondiabetic examination within 4 years preceding diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We measured changes in BMI between examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Before diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, there were steady gains in weight: mean BMI climbed between 0.43 and 0.71 kg/m(2) per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After diagnosis, the <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> declined, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> was generally seen; the mean rate of change of BMI ranged between -0.61 and +0.22 kg/m(2) per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When current treatment was considered, there was greater weight stability in individuals taking insulin compared with those not taking hypoglycemic medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Medication was a statistically significant factor for change in weight for most of the time intervals analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Before development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, there was a progressive rise in weight, and after diagnosis, there was a tendency toward <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>Weight-loss</z:hpo> interventions in individuals with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> will need to account for this tendency if they are to successfully modify the course of the disease </plain></SENT>
