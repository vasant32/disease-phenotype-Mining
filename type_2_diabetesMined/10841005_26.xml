<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Mice lacking the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha receptor 2 (TNFR2) gene fed a high-fat diet gain less weight and display reduced leptin and insulin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In humans, plasma levels of the soluble fraction of TNFR2 (sTNFR2) circulate in proportion to the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate a polymorphism in the 3' untranslated region of the TNFR2 gene on chromosome 1 in relation to BMI, leptin levels, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using single-strand conformation polymorphism, the polymorphism was analyzed in 107 nondiabetic subjects (60 women, 47 men) and in 110 consecutive patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (79 women, 31 men) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a subset of 33 healthy subjects, insulin sensitivity (minimal model analysis) was also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four alleles of the TNFR2 gene were identified (A1, A2, A3, and A4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BMI and serum leptin levels were significantly increased in young carriers of the A2 allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasma sTNFR2 levels were similar among the different TNFR2 gene variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, in subjects who did not carry the A2 allele, in young subjects, and in women, plasma sTNFR2 levels were proportional to BMI and leptin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the study sample, carriers of the A2 allele (n = 18) showed significantly <z:mp ids='MP_0006087'>increased BMI</z:mp>, fat mass, waist-to-hip ratio, serum total and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47776">VLDL triglyceride</z:chebi> levels, and leptin levels and had a lower insulin sensitivity index than noncarriers of the A2 variant (n = 15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the different alleles among diabetic subjects was similar to that in the control population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, diet-treated diabetic subjects (n = 49) who were carriers of the A2 allele exhibited significantly higher BMI and leptin levels than diet-treated noncarriers of the A2 allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The presence of the A2 allele in the TNFR2 gene may predispose subjects to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and higher leptin levels, which may in turn predispose them to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> or vice versa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The TNFR2 gene may be involved in weight-control mechanisms </plain></SENT>
