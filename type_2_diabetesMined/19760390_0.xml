<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested for a potential association between common <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> variants and a number of quantitative traits related to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a large sample of &gt;2,000 healthy Australian adolescent twins and their siblings, many of whom were measured on more than one occasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> association study of quantitative traits undertaken using family data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The maternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> pattern of mitochondria means established association methodologies are unsuitable for analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> data in families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We present a methodology, implemented in the freely available program Sib-Pair for performing such an analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Despite our study having the power to detect variants with modest effects on these phenotypes, only one significant association was found after correction for multiple testing in any of four age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was for mt14365 with triacylglycerol levels (unadjusted p = 0.0006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This association was not replicated in other age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We find little evidence in our sample to suggest that common European <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> variants contribute to variation in quantitative phenotypes related to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only one variant showed a significant association in our sample, and this association will need to be replicated in a larger cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Such replication studies or future meta-analyses may reveal more subtle effects that could not be detected here because of limitations of sample size </plain></SENT>
