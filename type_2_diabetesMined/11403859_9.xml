<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: this prospective observational study used a surveillance programme in primary and secondary care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of newly diagnosed Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> occurring from 1st May 1996 to 30th June 1998 through the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> health care process without any active screening in 186889 people registered with 24 primary care practices in the Poole area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: the 1996 prevalence of diagnosed Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in this population was 1.59 (95% CI 1.53-1.65%)% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the first 24 months of the study, 706 new cases of Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, 382 men and 324 women, were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The crude annual incidence of newly diagnosed Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, thus was 1.93/1000 (95% CI 1.73-2.13%) and age/sex adjusted incidence was 1.67/1000 (95% CI 1.49-1.84%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The age-adjusted incidence was higher in men, 1.86/1000 (95% CI 1.60-2.13), than in women, 1.48/1000 (95% CI 1.25-1.71%), relative risk 1.26 (95% CI 0.997-1.527%), but this difference did not reach statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean HbA1c at diagnosis was 10.8 (S.D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>2.9%)% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Men were younger at diagnosis than women (mean age, 62.9 vs. 65.9%, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: in UK, prior to the change in the WHO diagnostic criteria for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we estimate that over 98000 new cases of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were diagnosed each year </plain></SENT>
