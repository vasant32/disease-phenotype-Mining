<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the familiality of fasting and stimulated measures of plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, serum insulin, serum C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent insulinotropic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (GIP) and plasma glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) among non-diabetic relatives of Danish type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-one families comprising 193 non-diabetic offspring, 29 non-diabetic spouses, 72 non-diabetic relatives (parent, sibling, etc.) and two non-related relatives underwent a 4 h 75 g OGTT with measurements of plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, serum insulin, serum C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, plasma GIP and plasma GLP-1 levels at 18 time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Insulin secretion rates (ISR) and beta cell responses to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, GIP and GLP-1 were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Familiality was estimated based on OGTT-derived measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A high level of familiality was observed during the OGTT for plasma levels of GIP and GLP-1, with peak familiality values of 74 ± 16% and 65 ± 15%, respectively (h (2) ± SE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Familiality values were lower for plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, serum insulin and serum C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> during the OGTT (range 8-48%, 14-44% and 15-61%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ISR presented the highest familiality value at fasting reaching 59 ± 16% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Beta cell responsiveness to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, GLP-1 and GIP also revealed a strong genetic influence, with peak familiality estimates of 62 ± 13%, 76 ± 15% and 70 ± 14%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that circulating levels of GIP and GLP-1 as well as beta cell response to these incretins are highly familial compared with more commonly investigated measures of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis such as fasting and stimulated plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, serum insulin and serum C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
