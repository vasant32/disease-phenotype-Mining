<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is a progressive disease characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and impaired beta-cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatments that prevent further beta-cell decline are therefore essential for the management of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) is an incretin hormone that is known to stimulate <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, GLP-1 appears to have multiple positive effects on beta cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, GLP-1 is rapidly degraded by dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), which limits the clinical relevance of GLP-1 for the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two main classes of GLP-1-based therapies have now been developed: DPP-4 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Liraglutide and exenatide are examples of GLP-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> that have been developed to mimic the insulinotropic characteristics of endogenous GLP-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both have demonstrated improved beta-cell function in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, as assessed by homoeostasis model assessment-B analysis and proinsulin : insulin ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additionally, liraglutide and exenatide are able to enhance first- and second-phase insulin secretion and are able to restore beta-cell sensitivity to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Preclinical studies have shown that both liraglutide and exenatide treatment can increase beta-cell mass, stimulate beta-cell proliferation, increase beta-cell neogenesis and inhibit beta-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Clinical studies are needed to confirm these findings in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Replication of these data in humans could have important clinical implications for the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
