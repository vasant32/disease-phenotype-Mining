<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the effect of insulin glargine (LANTUS) versus <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin on metabolic control and safety in Asian patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, inadequately controlled on oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi> (OHAs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In this open-label, randomized, parallel, multinational, 24-week, non-inferiority study, 443 patients received either once-daily insulin glargine (n=220) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin (n=223) at bedtime, plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">Amaryl</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HbA(1c) levels decreased in the insulin glargine and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> groups over the study period in the per-protocol (PP; -1.10% versus 0.92%) and full-analysis (FA; -0.99% versus -0.77%) populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the PP population, the difference between adjusted means (predefined equivalence region &gt;-0.4%) was 0.19% (90% confidence interval [CI]: 0.02, 0.36), demonstrating non-inferiority between the two treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a superiority analysis (FA population), the difference between adjusted mean changes in the two groups was 0.22% (95% CI: 0.02, 0.42), demonstrating the superiority of insulin glargine (p=0.0319) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001988'>hypoglycemic episodes</z:hpo> was significantly lower with insulin glargine versus <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin (p&lt;0.004), particularly severe (p&lt;0.03) and nocturnal (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Daily insulin dose increased from 9.6+/-1.5 to 32.1+/-17.6 U in the insulin glargine group and from 9.8+/-1.9 to 32.8+/-18.9 U in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results confirm earlier reports that insulin glargine provides superior glycemic control with less <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> and demonstrates that these benefits are consistent between different ethnicities </plain></SENT>
