<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The gene encoding HNF-4alpha (HNF4A) is located on chromosome 20q12-q13 in a region that in several studies has shown linkage with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, two independent studies identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a 90-kb region spanning HNF4A, which showed strong association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the Finnish and Ashkenazi Jewish populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to replicate and extend these findings, we selected four SNPs in the same HNF4A region, which in the Finnish and Ashkenazi Jewish populations were associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and examined their relationships with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetic</z:e> phenotypes in the Danish Caucasian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The rs1884614, rs2425637, rs1885088 and rs3818247 were analysed in case-control studies of 1387, 1429, 1417 and 1371 type 2 diabetic patients and 4766, 4727, 4665 and 4748 glucose-tolerant subjects respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genotype-quantitative trait analyses comprised 4430, 4394, 4336 and 4413 middle-aged <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-tolerant subjects from the population-based Inter99 cohort for the rs1884614, rs2425637, rs1885088 and rs3818247 respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The risk allele of the rs1884614, which is located 4 kb upstream of the HNF4A P2 promoter, was associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (odds ratio [OR]=1.14, p=0.02) and with a subtle increase in post-OGTT plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-tolerant subjects (additive model, p=0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Consistent with results from studies of Finnish and Ashkenazi Jewish subjects, variation near the P2 region of HNF4A is associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the Danish population </plain></SENT>
