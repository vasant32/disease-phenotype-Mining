<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An important impediment to the more rapid evaluation of interventions for both T1DM and T2DM lack of biomarkers of pancreatic BCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A reliable means of monitoring the mass and/or function of beta-cells would enable evaluation of the progression of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> as well as the monitoring of pharmacologic and other interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, we identified a biomarker of BCM that is quantifiable by <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PET is an imaging technique which allows for non-invasive measurements of radioligand uptake and clearance, is sensitive in the pico- to nanomolar range and of which the results can be deconvoluted into measurements of receptor concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For BCM estimates, we have identified VMAT2 (vesicular <z:chebi fb="3" ids="25375">monoamine</z:chebi> transporter type 2) as a biomarker and [(11)C] DTBZ (dihydrotetrabenazine) as the transporter's ligand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>VMAT2 is highly expressed in beta-cells of the human pancreas relative to other cells of the <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> and exocrine pancreas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus measurements of [(11)C] DTBZ in the pancreas provide an indirect measurement of BCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Here we summarize our ongoing efforts to validate the clinical utility of this non-invasive approach to real-time BCM measurements </plain></SENT>
