<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a 26-week, open-label, randomized, parallel-group study in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, insulin-naive subjects concomitantly treated with MET ± second oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drug (OAD) were randomized 1 : 1 to IDet + SITA + MET or SITA + MET ± SU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> continued with MET treatment, and those treated with SU continued if randomized to SITA + MET ± SU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Efficacy endpoints included glycosylated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA1c), fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG), 9-point self-measured plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (SMPG), weight, body mass index (BMI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Safety endpoints included adverse events (AEs) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significantly higher reductions in HbA1c, FPG and SMPG were achieved with IDet + SITA + MET compared with SITA + MET ± SU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Estimated HbA1c decreased by 1.44% in the IDet + SITA + MET group versus 0.89% in SITA + MET ± SU, p &lt; 0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FPG decreased by 3.7 mmol/l (66.3 mg/dl) versus 1.2 mmol/l (22.2 mg/dl), p &lt; 0.001, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Small decreases in weight and BMI were observed in both arms, with no significant differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>AEs were mild or moderate and were more common in the SITA + MET ± SU arm than in the IDet + SITA + MET arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Observed rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> were very low (1.3/1.7 episodes/patient year) in both arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The subgroup treated with MET and SUs prior to the trial achieved similar results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The combination of once-daily IDet with SITA showed a clinically and significantly better improvement in glycaemic control than SITA in combination with or without SUs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Both regimens were associated with a low rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> and slight weight reduction </plain></SENT>
