<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mechanisms of PC-1 overexpression are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have identified a haplotype in the 3'-untranslated region of the PC-1 gene that may modulate PC-1 expression and confer an increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Individuals from Sicily, Italy, carrying the "P" haplotype (i.e., a cluster of three single nucleotide polymorphisms: G2897A, G2906C, and C2948T) were at higher risk (P &lt; 0.01) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and had higher (P &lt; 0.05) levels of plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin during an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test and higher levels of cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, and systolic blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They also had higher (P &lt; 0.05-0.01) PC-1 protein content in both skeletal muscle and cultured skin fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi> cells transfected with either P or <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> cDNA, specific PC-1 mRNA half-life was increased for those transfected with P (t/2 = 3.73 +/- 1.0 vs. 1.57 +/- 0.2 h; P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a population of different ethnicity (Gargano, East Coast Italy), patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (the most likely clinical outcome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>) had a higher P haplotype frequency than healthy control subjects (7.8 vs. 1.5%, P &lt; 0.01), thus replicating the association between the P allele and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>-related abnormalities observed among Sicilians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we have identified a possible molecular mechanism for PC-1 overexpression that confers an increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>-related abnormalities </plain></SENT>
