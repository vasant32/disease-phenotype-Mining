<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) recently identified common variants in the CDKN2A/CDKN2B region on chromosome 9p as being strongly associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since these association signals were not picked up by the French-Canadian GWAS, we sought to replicate these findings in the French Europid population and to further characterise the susceptibility variants at this novel locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We genotyped 20 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning the CDKN2A/CDKN2B locus in our type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> case-control cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The association between CDKN2A/CDKN2B SNPs and quantitative metabolic traits was also examined in the normoglycaemic participants comprising the control cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We report replication of the strong association of rs10811661 with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> found in the GWASs (P= 3.8 X 10(-7); OR 1.43 [95% CI 1.24-1.64]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The other CDKN2A/CDKN2B susceptibility variant, rs564398, did not attain statistical significance (p = 0.053; OR 1.11 [95% CI 1.00-1.24]) in the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also obtained several additional nominal association signals (p &lt; 0.05) at the CDKN2A/CDKN2B locus; however, only the rs3218018 result (p = 0.002) survived Bonferroni correction for multiple testing (adjusted p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our comprehensive association study of common variation spanning the CDKN2A/CDKN2B locus confirms the strong association between the distal susceptibility variant rs10811661 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the French population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further genetic and functional studies are required to identify the aetiological variants at this locus and determine the cellular and physiological mechanisms by which they act to modulate type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility </plain></SENT>
