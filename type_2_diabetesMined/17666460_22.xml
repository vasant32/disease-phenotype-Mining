<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between nonalcoholic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>fatty liver</z:hpo> disease and the risk for development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted an observational cohort study in male workers &gt; or = 40 years old in a Japanese company from 1997 to 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We excluded workers with alcohol intake &gt; or = 20 g/day and those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> by a 75-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The remaining 3,189 workers were classified into <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>fatty liver</z:hpo> (FL) and non-FL group based on the findings of abdominal ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both groups were followed for the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hazard ratio (HR) was determined in Cox proportional hazard analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A nested case-control study was conducted to determine the odds ratio (OR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The average age of participants was 48.0 years at the entry, and the average follow-up period was 4.0 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the FL group was 2,073 per 100,000 person-years (65 cases), whereas 452 per 100,000 person-years (44 cases) in the non-FL group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The age- and BMI-adjusted HR of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> associated with FL was 5.5 (95% CI 3.6-8.5, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the nested case-control analysis, the OR adjusted for age and BMI was 4.6 (3.0-6.9, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Nonalcoholic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>fatty liver</z:hpo> disease significantly increases the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in middle-aged Japanese men </plain></SENT>
