<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data were collected from 37children/adolescents of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients and 37 controls from parents without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Variables included physical activity, diet, socioeconomic class, family history, ethnic background, anthropometric measures, blood pressure and fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Groups were comparable for age and gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Differences between cases and controls were found for BMI (22.6 vs. 19.1kg/m(2), p=0.004), waist circumference (70.1 vs. 62.1cm, p=0.014), systolic blood pressure (104.5+/-15.1 vs. 97.9+/-13.4mmHg, p=0.05), diastolic blood pressure (66.2+/-10.9 vs. 60.7+/-10.1mmHg, p=0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vegetable intake (3% of cases having two and 19% one full serving a day vs., respectively, 14% and 32% amongst controls, p=0.01) was less favourable in cases, and physical activity tended to be (5h vs. 9h/week, p=0.065) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Children of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients have higher BMI and blood pressure than controls but also lead a less healthy lifestyle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This suggests that both genetic and lifestyle factors contribute to the increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> in children and early preventive measures towards changing lifestyle could help in prevention </plain></SENT>
