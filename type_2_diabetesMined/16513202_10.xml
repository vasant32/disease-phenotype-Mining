<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, approximately half of the daily insulin requirement constitutes basal insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether increasing the dose of insulin glargine up to half of the total insulin requirement could lead to better glycemic control in type 2 diabetic patients who were treated on basal-prandial insulin therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 62 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on mealtime rapid-acting insulin analogue and bedtime <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> were randomized to either continuation of bedtime <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> (n=31) or morning glargine (n=31) for 6 months while continuing the aspart/lispro at each meal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The two groups were matched for age, sex, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration, BMI, HbA(1C), endogenous insulin secretion, and proportion of numbers using aspart/lispro and using oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The dose of insulin glargine was increased by 2-4 units to meet the target fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, whereas the dose of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> was principally unchanged as a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean HbA(1C) at baseline was similar between patients with glargine and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> (7.2% versus 6.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The percentage of glargine dose increased significantly (31% at baseline to 48% at 6 months) without any significant changes in total insulin dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean HbA(1C) at 3 months was 6.6% with glargine and 7.0% with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> (P&lt;0.0001, adjusted mean change between-treatment difference 0.6% [95% CI 0.3-0.9]), and the values at 6 months were 6.6% and 6.9%, respectively (P=0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> did not differ between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Increasing the dose of glargine without changing the total daily insulin dose resulted in significantly better glycemic control in type 2 diabetic patients on basal-prandial insulin therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conversion from bedtime <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> to morning glargine appears efficacious with no increase in frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
