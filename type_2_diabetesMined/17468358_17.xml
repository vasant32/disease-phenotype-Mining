<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined trends in the incidence rate of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among Pima Indians between 1965 and 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Incidence rates were computed independently in three 13-year time periods in Pima Indians aged &gt; or = 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> was defined by the presence of at least one of two criteria: 1) 2-h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration &gt; or = 200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/l) or 2) hypoglycemic treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 8,236 subjects without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at baseline, 1,005 incident cases occurred during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Age- and sex-adjusted incidence rates of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were 25.3 cases/1,000 patient-years (95% CI 22.5-28.0) in 1965-1977, 22.9 cases/1,000 patient years (20.0-25.8) in 1978-1990, and 23.5 cases/1,000 patient years (20.5-26.5) in 1991-2003 (P = 0.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence rate in subjects aged 5-14 years was 5.7 (1.9-17.4) times as high in the last as in the first period, but the rate declined in those aged 25-34 years (incidence rate ratio 0.6 [0.4-0.8]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sex-adjusted prevalence increased significantly over time only in those aged 5-24 years (P(trend) &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The overall incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among Pima Indians remained stable over the past four decades, with a significant rise occurring only in the youth </plain></SENT>
