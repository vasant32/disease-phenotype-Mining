<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (GLP-1) receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and have potentially beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk biomarkers; however, there is limited information to indicate whether these effects remain outside of clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Medical records from the General Electric Centricity research database were analyzed retrospectively to evaluate the relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and glycemic control and changes in blood pressure and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> initiating therapy with exenatide, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi>, or insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Baseline and follow-up (90-365 days after the index date) for weight, A1C, fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FBG), blood pressure, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>, and total cholesterol were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 6,280, 5,861, and 32,398 patients receiving exenatide, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi>, or insulin, respectively, were included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Exenatide-treated patients lost a mean +/- SD of 3.0 +/- 7.33 kg, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi>-treated patients lost 1.1 +/- 5.39 kg, and insulin-treated patients gained 0.6 +/- 9.49 kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a significant association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and a reduction in A1C and FBG with exenatide only and a reduction in blood pressure for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>Weight loss</z:hpo> was associated with some improvements in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, primarily in the GLP-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> group, with little association in the insulin group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Weight reduction with GLP-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> was associated with a shift toward a more favorable cardiovascular risk profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Outcome trials are needed to determine whether improvement in biomarkers translates into a reduction in cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
