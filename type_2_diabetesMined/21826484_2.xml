<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Heritability estimates for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> adjusted for sex, age and BMI are provided for different age groups of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and for 34 clinical and metabolic traits in 5,810 individuals from 942 families using a variance component model (SOLAR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, family means of these traits and their distribution across families are calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The strongest heritability for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was seen in patients with age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> 35-60 years (h (2) = 0.69) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, including patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> up to 75 years dropped the h (2) estimates to 0.31 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among quantitative traits, the highest h (2) estimates in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> individuals and in non-diabetic individuals were seen for lean body mass (h (2) = 0.53-0.65), <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> (0.52-0.61) and suppression of NEFA during OGTT (0.63-0.76) followed by measures of insulin secretion (insulinogenic index [IG(30)] = 0.41-0.50) and insulin action (insulin sensitivity index [ISI] = 0.37-0.40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, physical activity showed rather low heritability (0.16-0.18), whereas smoking showed strong heritability (0.57-0.59) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Family means of these traits differed two- to fivefold between families belonging to the lowest and highest quartile of the trait (p &lt; 0.00001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: To detect stronger genetic effects in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, it seems reasonable to restrict inclusion of patients to those with age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> 35-60 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sequencing of families with extreme quantitative traits could be an important next step in the dissection of the genetics of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
