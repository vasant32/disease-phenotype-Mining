<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to examine the effects of FTO variants on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Southeast Asian populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We examined associations between nine previously reported FTO single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and related traits in 4,298 participants (2,919 Chinese, 785 Malays, and 594 Asian Indians) from the 1998 Singapore National Health Survey (NHS98) and 2,996 Malays from the Singapore Malay Eye Study (SiMES) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> nine SNPs exhibited strong linkage disequilibrium (r(2) = 0.6-0.99), and minor alleles were associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in the same direction as previous studies with effect sizes ranging from 0.42 to 0.68 kg/m(2) (P &lt; 0.0001) in NHS98 Chinese, 0.65 to 0.91 kg/m(2) (P &lt; 0.02) in NHS98 Malays, and 0.52 to 0.64 kg/m(2) (P &lt; 0.0001) in SiMES Malays after adjustment for age, sex, smoking, alcohol consumption, and exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The variants were also associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, though not after adjustment for BMI (with the exception of the SiMES Malays: odds ratio 1.17-1.22; P &lt;/= 0.026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: FTO variants common among European populations are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in ethnic Chinese and Malays in Singapore </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data do not support the hypothesis that differences in allele frequency or genetic architecture underlie the lack of association observed in some populations of Asian ancestry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Examination of gene-environment interactions involving variants at this locus may provide further insights into the role of FTO in the pathogenesis of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
