<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were collected from 2006 to 2008 US National Health and Wellness Survey and the Ailment Panel of Lightspeed Online Research, an internet-based questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adults (≥ 18 years) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> taking ≥ 1 oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> agent (OAD), but not insulin, were included (n=2074) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analyses included logistic regression and generalized linear models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, patients who reported experiencing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> symptoms (n=286; 13.78%) were significantly more likely to have a lower HRQL on several parameters including: increased limitations on mobility (b=0.66, OR=1.93, p&lt;0.0001) and usual activities (b=0.58, OR=1.78, p&lt;0.0001), increased pain/discomfort (b=0.69, OR=2.00, p&lt;0.0001) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (b=0.84, OR=2.31, p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They also had a lower total treatment satisfaction score as measured by the DiabMedSat tool (b=-7.66, p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Self-reported rates of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related emergency room (b=0.98, p=0.004) and physician visits (b=0.30, p&lt;0.0001) were also higher among these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Among OAD-treated type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients, symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> tend to be correlated with significantly lower HRQL, lower treatment satisfaction and higher levels of healthcare resource utilization </plain></SENT>
