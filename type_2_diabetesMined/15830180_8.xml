<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and electrical spinal cord stimulation have been proposed as physical therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a controlled, randomised pilot trial to compare the effects of high-frequency external muscle stimulation (HF) with those of TENS in patients with symptomatic DSP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and DSP (n=41) were randomised to receive treatment with TENS or HF using strata for non-painful (n=20) and painful sensory symptoms (n=21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both lower extremities were treated for 30 min daily for three consecutive days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients' degree of symptoms and pain were graded daily on a scale of one to ten, before, during and 2 days after treatment termination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Responders were defined by the alleviation of one or more symptoms by at least three points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The two treatment groups were similar in terms of baseline characteristics, such as age, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, neurological symptoms scores and neurological disability scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The responder rate was significantly higher (p&lt;0.05) in the HF group (80%, 16 out of 20) than in the TENS group (33%, seven out of 21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analysis revealed that HF was more effective than TENS in relieving the symptoms of non-painful <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> (HF: 100%, seven out of seven; TENS: 44%, four out of nine; p&lt;0.05) and painful <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> (HF: 69%, nine out of 13; TENS: 25%, three out of 12; p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The responders did not differ in terms of the reduction in mean symptom intensity during the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: This pilot study shows, for the first time, that HF can ameliorate the discomfort and pain associated with DSP, and suggests that HF is more effective than TENS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>External muscle stimulation offers a new therapeutic option for DSP </plain></SENT>
