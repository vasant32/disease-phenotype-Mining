<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate prospectively whether intake of total or type of sugar is associated with the risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The contribution of sugar intake to the pathogenesis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> has not been settled in the context of primary prevention because of limited prospective data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The Women's Health Study is a randomized controlled trial of aspirin and vitamin E in the prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A validated semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire was completed by 39,345 women aged 45 years and older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The main outcome was the incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The predictor was sugar intake, including <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28757">fructose</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="17716">lactose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using Cox proportional hazard models, multivariate RRs of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for increasing quintiles of sugar intake compared with the lowest quintile were estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with the lowest quintile of sugar intake, the RRs and 95% CIs for the highest quintiles were 0.84 (0.67-1.04) for <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi>, 0.96 (0.78-1.19) for <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28757">fructose</z:chebi>, 1.04 (0.85-1.28) for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and 0.99 (0.80-1.22) for <z:chebi fb="8" ids="17716">lactose</z:chebi>, after adjustment for known risk factors for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similar findings of no association were obtained in subgroup analyses stratified by BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intake of <z:chebi fb="96" ids="16646">sugars</z:chebi> does not appear to play a deleterious role in primary prevention of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These prospective data support the recent American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association's guideline that a moderate amount of sugar can be incorporated in a healthy diet </plain></SENT>
