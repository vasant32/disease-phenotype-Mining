<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor-gamma2 (PPAR-gamma2) is a nuclear receptor that plays an important role in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism and insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to investigate the association of Pro12Ala polymorphism at the PPAR-gamma2 gene in Brazilian patients with type-2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2Dm) and controls (CG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Genomic DNA was obtained from 207 unrelated white people presenting with T2Dm and from 170 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anthropometric data included body mass index and waist to hip ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Biochemical parameters included fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, total cholesterol, high- and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> and insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Screening for mutations in the entire coding region of the PPAR-gamma gene was performed by means of polymerase chain reaction (PCR), single-strand conformational polymorphism and sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pro12Ala polymorphism was analysed by using PCR-RFLP (restriction fragment-length polymorphism) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One base substitution was identified - a C to G substitution in exon B of the PPAR-gamma2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the Ala12 allele in T2Dm (0.09) was similar to that found in CG (0.06, p = 0.185) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the T2Dm group, Ala12 allele was associated with lower fasting plasma insulin levels (p = 0.036) and higher insulin sensitivity (p = 0.049) by means of homeostasis model assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Among <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> people, there was no association between any of the T2Dm or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-related traits and the Pro12Ala polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study suggest that people with the Ala12 allele of the PPAR-gamma2 gene could be more sensitive to insulin than those carriers of the Pro12 allele among Brazilian Caucasians </plain></SENT>
