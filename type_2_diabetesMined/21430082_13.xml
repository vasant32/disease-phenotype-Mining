<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 6,537 of the 11,247 adults evaluated in 1999-2000 in the Australian <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> and Lifestyle (AusDiab) study, returned for oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) in 2004-2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied those without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who had complete data at baseline (n = 5,200; mean age 51 years; 55% were women; 92% were Europids) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum 25OHD and energy-adjusted calcium intake (food frequency questionnaire) were assessed at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression was used to evaluate associations between serum 25OHD and dietary calcium on 5-year incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (diagnosed by OGTT) and insulin sensitivity (homeostasis model assessment of insulin sensitivity [HOMA-S]), adjusted for multiple potential confounders, including fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the 5-year follow-up, 199 incident cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Those who developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had lower serum 25OHD (mean 58 vs. 65 nmol/L; P &lt; 0.001) and calcium intake (mean 881 vs. 923 mg/day; P = 0.03) compared with those who remained free of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Each 25 nmol/L increment in serum 25OHD was associated with a 24% reduced risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (odds ratio 0.76 [95% CI 0.63-0.92]) after adjusting for age, waist circumference, ethnicity, season, latitude, smoking, physical activity, family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, dietary <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, and FPG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Dietary calcium intake was not associated with reduced <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only serum 25OHD was positively and independently associated with HOMA-S at 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Higher serum 25OHD levels, but not higher dietary calcium, were associated with a significantly reduced risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Australian adult men and women </plain></SENT>
