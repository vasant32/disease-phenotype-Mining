<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ten-month-old male rats exposed to either prenatal nutrient restriction with ad libitum postnatal intake (IUGR), pre- and postnatal nutrient restriction (IPGR), or postnatal nutrient restriction limited to the suckling phase (50% from postnatal [PN]1 to PN21) (PNGR) were compared with age-matched controls (CON) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 10-month-old male IUGR group had a 1.5- to 2.0-fold increase in subcutaneous and visceral fat (P &lt; 0.0002) while remaining euglycemic, insulin sensitive, inactive, and exhibiting metabolic inflexibility (Vo(2)) versus CON </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The IPGR group remained lean, euglycemic, insulin sensitive, and active while maintaining metabolic flexibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The PNGR group was insulin sensitive, similar to IPGR, but less active while maintaining metabolic flexibility </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Postnatal nutrient restriction superimposed on IUGR was protective, restoring metabolic normalcy to a lean and active phenotype </plain></SENT>
