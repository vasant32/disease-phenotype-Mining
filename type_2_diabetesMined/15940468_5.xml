<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the relationship between NEFA dynamics, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta cell dysfunction</z:hpo> in women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878751" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">late pregnancy</z:e> and postpartum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 19 Caucasian women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> and 19 healthy pregnant women matched for BMI and age underwent an IVGTT in the third trimester and 4 months postpartum, deriving values for insulin sensitivity (SI), insulin secretion (AIRg) and disposition index (DI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NEFA levels were measured serially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In pregnancy, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> women had similar SI but reduced AIRg and DI compared with control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> group demonstrated significantly slower NEFA suppression, which was attributable to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> women who required insulin during pregnancy (n=7) and who had markedly reduced AIRg and K(NEFA) (NEFA disappearance constant) compared with their matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> subjects not requiring insulin (n=12) had similar NEFA suppression curves and AIRg to control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Postpartum, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> subjects demonstrated reduced SI and DI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The impaired suppression of NEFA persisted postpartum, but again only in the subgroup of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> subjects who had required insulin during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, K(NEFA) correlated with AIRg and DI in both states, but not with SI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Impaired NEFA suppression occurs in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> subjects both in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878751" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">late pregnancy</z:e> and postpartum in response to IVGTT-induced endogenous insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The impaired NEFA suppression is present in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> women with the most severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta cell dysfunction</z:hpo> (who had required insulin during pregnancy) and is related to their insulin secretory dysfunction rather than their reduced SI </plain></SENT>
