<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> is a serious complication of both type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and, unless arrested, leads to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Current diagnosis consists of urine assays of <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp>, which have inadequate specificity and sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used proteomic analyses to identify novel biomarkers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in urine from type 2 diabetic patients with demonstrated normo-, micro-, or macroalbuminuria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Samples were analyzed by fluorescence two-dimensional (2-D) differential in-gel electrophoresis (DIGE), and protein identification was performed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 2-D DIGE analysis of the urinary proteome in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> identified 195 protein spots representing 62 unique proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These proteins belonged to several functional groups, i.e., cell development, cell organization, defense response, metabolism, and signal transduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparisons between control and diabetic subjects with different stages of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo> revealed the differential expression of several proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Spot volume quantification identified 7 proteins that were progressively upregulated with increasing <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> and 4 proteins that exhibited progressive downregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The majority of these potential candidate biomarkers were <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate the ability of proteomic analyses to reveal potential biomarkers for diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in urine, an important step forward in advancing accurate diagnosis and our understanding of disease mechanisms </plain></SENT>
