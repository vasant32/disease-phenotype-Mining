<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The inhibition of gut and renal <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> cotransporters (SGLTs) has been proposed as a novel therapeutic approach to the treatment of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have identified dapagliflozin as a potent and selective inhibitor of the renal <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> cotransporter SGLT2 in vitro and characterized its in vitro and in vivo pharmacology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Cell-based assays measuring <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> analog uptake were used to assess dapagliflozin's ability to inhibit <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>-dependent and facilitative <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transport activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> and multi-dose studies in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and diabetic rats were performed to assess the ability of dapagliflozin to improve fed and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp study was performed to assess the ability of dapagliflozin to improve <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization after multi-dose treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Dapagliflozin potently and selectively inhibited human SGLT2 versus human SGLT1, the major cotransporter of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in the gut, and did not significantly inhibit facilitative <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transport in human adipocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vivo, dapagliflozin acutely induced renal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excretion in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and diabetic rats, <z:mp ids='MP_0005292'>improved glucose tolerance</z:mp> in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rats, and reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> in <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats after single oral doses ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Once-daily dapagliflozin treatment over 2 weeks significantly lowered fasting and fed <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels at doses ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 mg/kg and resulted in a significant increase in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization rate accompanied by a significant reduction in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that dapagliflozin has the potential to be an efficacious treatment for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
