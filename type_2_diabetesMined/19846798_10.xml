<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Although <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5001">fenofibrate</z:chebi> was associated with less progression of <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5001">Fenofibrate</z:chebi> Intervention and Event Lowering in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> (FIELD) study, it is unknown if it has any effect on renal function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We explored if there were changes in commonly available markers of renal function during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5001">fenofibrate</z:chebi> treatment in the FIELD Helsinki cohort excluding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> users </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: One hundred and seventy subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were randomly assigned to micronized <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5001">fenofibrate</z:chebi> (200 mg/day) or placebo for 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this substudy, we measured several markers of albumin excretion and renal function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After intensified treatment, blood pressure and fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> decreased in both groups while A1C remained at 7.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> increased with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5001">fenofibrate</z:chebi> while urine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> remained comparable between the groups, resulting in significant decreases in both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by the Modification of Diet in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Renal Disease</z:e> (MDRD)-4 and Cockroft-Gault equations in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5001">fenofibrate</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cystatin C increased during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5001">fenofibrate</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Urinary albumin-to-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio and diurnal urine protein remained unchanged, whereas overnight urinary albumin excretion rate showed minor decreases in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We report concomitant decreases in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance and eGFR by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5001">fenofibrate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These changes complicate the clinical surveillance during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5001">fenofibrate</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We could not demonstrate the beneficial effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5001">fenofibrate</z:chebi> on albumin excretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A novel finding is the increase of cystatin C in type 2 diabetic patients during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5001">fenofibrate</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The clinical relevance of the changes needs to be assessed in a long-term outcome study of renal function </plain></SENT>
