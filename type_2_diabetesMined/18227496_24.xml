<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> significantly affects the quality of life and reduces the average life expectancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effective treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> should address both the medical and the social burden of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> needs to be treated within the health care system as any other complex disease, with empathy and without prejudice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both health care providers and patients should know that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> treatment is a lifelong task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They should also set realistic goals before starting the treatment, whereas keeping in mind that even a modest <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> of 5-15% significantly reduces <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-related health risks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Essential treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> includes low-calorie low-fat diets, increased physical activity, and strategies contributing to the modification of lifestyle </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A short-term <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, up to 6 months, is usually achieved easily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the long-term weight management is often associated with a lack of compliance, failures, and a high dropout rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Regular physical activity, cognitive behavioral modification of lifestyle, and administration of anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> drugs improve <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> maintenance </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> treatment should be individually tailored and the following factors should be taken into account: sex, the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, individual health risks, psychobehavioral and metabolic characteristics, and the outcome of previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> attempts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In the future, an evaluation of hormonal and genetic determinants of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> could also contribute to a better choice of individual therapy for a particular <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>A multilevel <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> management network of mutually collaborating facilities should be established to provide individually tailored treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Centers of excellence in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> management represented by multidisciplinary teams should provide comprehensive programs for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> derived from evidence-based medicine </plain></SENT>
