<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Also, islets in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> often contain deposits of islet amyloid derived from islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (IAPP), a 37-amino acid protein cosecreted with insulin by beta-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several lines of evidence suggest that proteins with a capacity to develop amyloid fibrils may also form small toxic oligomers that can initiate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The amino acid sequence of IAPP in rats and mice is identical and differs from that in humans by substitution of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32874">proline residues</z:chebi> in the amyloidogenic sequence so that the protein no longer forms amyloid fibrils or is cytotoxic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we report a novel rat model for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>: rats transgenic for human IAPP (the HIP rat) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HIP rats develop <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> between 5 and 10 months of age, characterized by an approximately 60% deficit in beta-cell mass that is due to an increased frequency of beta-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HIP rats develop islet amyloid, but the extent of amyloid was not related to the frequency of beta-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> (r = 0.10, P = 0.65), whereas the fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was (r = 0.77, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequency of beta-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was related to the frequency of beta-cell replication (r = 0.97, P &lt; 0.001) in support of the hypothesis that replicating cells are more vulnerable to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> than nondividing cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The HIP rat provides additional evidence in support of the potential role of IAPP oligomer formation toward the increased frequency of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, a process that appears to be compounded by <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> toxicity when <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> supervenes </plain></SENT>
