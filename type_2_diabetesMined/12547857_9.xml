<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We studied outcome of pregnancy among immigrant women with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The women came from regions of the world with high incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prevalences, secular trends, and sociodemographic risk factors of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were also explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> births from 1988 to 1998 for mothers born in South Asia and North Africa (11,268) and Norway (601,785) were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of pregestational <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among the immigrants was 8.9/1,000 births, which was more than twice the rate among ethnic Norwegians (3.6/1,000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Time trends indicated increasing prevalences in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the immigrants, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was closely associated with maternal age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>Maternal diabetes</z:hpo> was associated with a significantly increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032962" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pregnancy complications</z:e> in both study groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increased risks were found for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birth weight</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001520'>macrosomia</z:hpo>, preterm birth, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">preeclampsia</z:e>, and cesarean sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among ethnic Norwegians, <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>maternal diabetes</z:hpo> conferred a significantly increased risk of infant perinatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (odds ratio 2.00, 95% CI 1,44-2.77) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the sample of immigrant women with predominantly type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>maternal diabetes</z:hpo> was not significantly associated with perinatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1705254" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital malformations</z:e> in the offspring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among immigrants from South Asia and North Africa represents a challenge for health care providers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>To prevent adverse pregnancy outcomes and later cardiovascular and renal morbidity among these groups, early diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, adequate metabolic control, and relevant preventive measures are warranted </plain></SENT>
