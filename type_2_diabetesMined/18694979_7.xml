<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 86 clinics participated, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> using electronic medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Quality indicators were identified, and software was developed, enabling the extraction of the information needed for quality-of-care profiling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 114,249 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were seen during 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A1C was measured at least once in 88.0% of the patients, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile in 64.6%, blood pressure in 77.2%, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> in 48.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, 43.1% of individuals had A1C &lt;or=7.0%, 36.6% had blood pressure &lt;or=130/85 mmHg, and 29.8% had <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> &lt;100 mg/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only 5.5% of the patients had achieved <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the favorable outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Wide between-center variation was documented for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> indicators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first step of a nationwide quality-improvement effort and documents the possibility of obtaining standardized information to be used for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care profiling and benchmarking activities </plain></SENT>
