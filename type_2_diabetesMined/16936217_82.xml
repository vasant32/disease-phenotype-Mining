<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genetic variants within TCF7L2 on chromosome 10q were recently reported to be associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Icelandic, Danish, and American (U.S.) samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We previously observed a modest logarithm of odds score of 0.61 on chromosome 10q, approximately 1 Mb from TCF7L2, in the Finland-United States Investigation of <z:mp ids='MP_0002057'>NIDDM</z:mp> Genetics study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We tested the five associated TCF7L2 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variants in a Finnish sample of 1,151 type 2 diabetic patients and 953 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We confirmed the association with the same risk allele (P value &lt;0.05) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five SNPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our strongest results were for rs12255372 (odds ratio [OR] 1.36 [95% CI 1.15-1.61], P = 0.00026) and rs7903146 (1.33 [1.14-1.56], P = 0.00042) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on the CEU HapMap data, we selected and tested 12 additional SNPs to tag SNPs in linkage disequilibrium with rs12255372 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of these SNPs showed stronger evidence of association than rs12255372 or rs7903146 (OR &lt; or =1.26, P &gt; or = 0.0054) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results strengthen the evidence that one or more variants in TCF7L2 are associated with increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
