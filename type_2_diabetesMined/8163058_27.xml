<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As such changes are already present at diagnosis in patients with Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, subjects at risk of developing the disease, who had elevated fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations below the diabetic range, were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The maximal microvascular hyperaemic response to local heating was determined in the feet of 11 subjects with fasting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> and 11 age- and sex-matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was reduced maximal hyperaemia in the subjects with fasting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> (1.01 [0.71-1.57]V, median and range), when compared to control subjects (1.41 [1.32-2.13]V, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is unlikely that this limited vasodilation is a result of the mild degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> observed in the subjects included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further studies are therefore required to address the possible mechanisms of limited microvascular reactivity in subjects at risk of developing Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
