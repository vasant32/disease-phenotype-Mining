<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A1chieve was a 24-week, international, prospective, observational, multi-centre, open-label study in individuals with T2D starting treatment with BIAsp30, insulin detemir or insulin aspart as part of routine clinical care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean baseline (SD) dose BHI was 0.56 (0.25) IU/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BIAsp30 was initiated at 0.57 (0.25) U/kg; the daily dose was 0.62 (0.28)U/kg by Week 24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Switching from BHI30 to BIAsp30 was associated with significant mean reduction in HbA1c of 1.7% [-18 mmol/mol] (1.6) from a baseline of 9.1% [76 mmol/mol] (p&lt;0.001); FPG and <z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi> were also significantly reduced (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0745153" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemic episodes</z:e> decreased from 0.69 events/patient/year at baseline to 0.03 events/patient/year at Week 24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Minor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> decreased from 5.31 to 2.04 events/patient/year from baseline to study-end </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five serious adverse drug reactions (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e>) were reported by five individuals (0.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean bodyweight increased by 0.1 (3.3)kg from baseline to 24 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Improved self-reported quality of life was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Switching from BHI30 to BIAsp30 in individuals with T2D is associated with improvement in glycaemic control and reduced rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e>, without tolerability or safety issues </plain></SENT>
