<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is associated with its beneficial effects on endothelial function and heart rate variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> is another area, where <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> withdrawal has proven to be of particular value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We postulated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27584,30834">aldosterone</z:chebi> blockade with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9241">spironolactone</z:chebi> might also have beneficial effects on the prognostic markers of endothelial function and heart rate variability in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We assessed endothelial function by forearm venous occlusion plethysmography in 42 patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> after 1 month of treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9241">spironolactone</z:chebi> or placebo allocated in a randomised double-blind trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 42 patients, 20 were on <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitor</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also assessed heart rate variability, HbA1c and plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> levels at the end of each treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared to placebo, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9241">spironolactone</z:chebi> decreased forearm blood flow response to <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> by 44.56+/-14.56% (p=0.003) in the group as a whole and by 57.61+/-15.56% (p&lt;0.001) in the 20 patients on ACE inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9241">Spironolactone</z:chebi> also worsened heart rate variability parameters, with root mean squared standard deviation decreased by 1.99+/-0.93 ms (p=0.03), low-frequency normalised power increased by 2.00+/-0.91 normalised units (nu) (p=0.03), high-frequency normalised power decreased by 1.98+/-0.94 nu (p=0.04) and the low frequency : high frequency ratio increased by 0.40+/-0.19 (p=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>HbA1c and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> increased during treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9241">spironolactone</z:chebi> by 0.26+/-0.07% (p=0.001) and 8.12+/-1.94 pg/ml (p=0.001) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9241">Spironolactone</z:chebi> worsened endothelial function and heart rate variability in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings are possibly due to the worsening of glycaemic control and increase in plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> that were seen with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9241">spironolactone</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus the prescription of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9241">spironolactone</z:chebi> to diabetic patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> does not seem to be justified </plain></SENT>
