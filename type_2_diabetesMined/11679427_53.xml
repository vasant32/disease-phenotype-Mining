<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether this is similar in first-degree relatives of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 21 first-degree relatives, 10 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and 10 control subjects (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance) were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During a hyperglycemic "clamp" (140 mg/dl for 120 min), synthetic human GIP (2 pmol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>kg(-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>min(-1)) was infused intravenously (30-90 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With exogenous GIP, patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> responded with a lower increment (Delta) in insulin (P = 0.0003) and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> concentrations (P &lt; 0.0001) than control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The GIP effects in first-degree relatives were diminished compared with control subjects (Delta insulin: P = 0.04; Delta C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>: P = 0.016) but significantly higher than in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P &lt; or = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The responses over the time course were below the 95% CI derived from control subjects in 7 (insulin) and 11 (C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>) of 21 first-degree relatives of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, a reduced insulinotropic activity of GIP is typical for a substantial subgroup of normoglycemic first-degree relatives of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, pointing to an early, possibly genetic defect </plain></SENT>
