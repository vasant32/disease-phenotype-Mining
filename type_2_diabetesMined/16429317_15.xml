<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesised that improving insulin sensitivity would improve fasting and postprandial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> metabolism in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To this aim we studied fasting and postprandial lipaemia in type 2 diabetic patients before and after sensitisation to insulin with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>, compared with that observed in patients on an insulin-providing regime </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a double-blind placebo-controlled protocol, 22 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were randomly allocated to receive either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (45 mg/day) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> (5 mg/day), for a 20-week period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fasting and postprandial <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism were investigated at baseline and at the end of the treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A group of non-diabetic subjects was also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> treatment, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> treatment decreased fasting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin levels and the homeostasis model assessment score of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Decreased fasting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> treatment was due to reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47776">VLDL triglyceride</z:chebi>, particularly <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">Lipoprotein</z:chebi> lipase activity was unchanged by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> treatment but hepatic lipase showed a significant decrease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">Pioglitazone</z:chebi> treatment lowered total postprandial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>, as well as chylomicron- and chylomicron-remnant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15040">retinyl palmitate</z:chebi> levels to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> disposal improved but remained abnormal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Insulin sensitisation with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> has major effects in restoring postprandial lipaemia to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, while also correcting fasting hypertriglyceridaemia; both factors may have consequences for atherogenic risk in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
