<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Data on the nationwide incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were obtained from four data sources: standardised reports from <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> nurses, the Finnish National Hospital Discharge Register, the Drug Reimbursement Register and the Drug Prescription Register </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The inclusion criterion was consistency in the diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> across at least two data sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The sex- and age-specific incidence was calculated for 5-year age groups, both for type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effects of age, sex and year of diagnosis were assessed by fitting the linear regression model to the incidence data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between 1992 and 1996 the age-adjusted incidence of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among 15-39 year olds was 15.9 per 100,000/year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence was highest among the 15-19 year olds and decreased with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conversely, the incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was very low among 15-19 year olds and increased with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The total age-adjusted incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among 15-39 year olds was 11.8 per 100,000/year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The average annual increase in the incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 7.9% (95% CI 3.7-12.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The age at which the Finnish population is at risk of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> extends into young adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The rapid increase in the incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the young adult population is a current public health problem </plain></SENT>
