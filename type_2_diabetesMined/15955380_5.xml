<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is now substantial evidence that T2DM can be prevented or delayed by lifestyle modification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A statistically significant reduction of relative risk of newly diagnosed T2DM was observed in large clinical trials with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> or orlistat in subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> as well as with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> in women with previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A relative risk reduction of newly diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was observed in prospective, double blind clinical studies evaluating the effect of different <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive drugs</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE-inhibitors</z:chebi>, angiotensin repector blockers, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38215">calcium channel blockers</z:chebi>) or that of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering agents (pravastatin) on the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301700" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular morbidity</z:e> and mortality in high risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In studies with postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy a relative risk reduction of newly developed T2DM was also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, T2DM should be considered as a preventable disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs with an indication of preventing T2DM are not registered in several countries at present, so that drug therapy should not be used as a routine for preventing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, patients with pre-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (impaired fasting glycaemia, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo>) should be given counseling on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> as well as instruction for increasing physical activity in order to prevent T2DM </plain></SENT>
