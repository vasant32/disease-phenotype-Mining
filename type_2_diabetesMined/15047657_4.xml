<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study, using a continuous 12-lead electrocardiogram, examined the possible association of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with both <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> intravenous thrombolysis effectiveness and long-term prognosis in this setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study included 726 consecutive subjects (214 type 2 diabetic subjects) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> who received intravenous thrombolysis in the first 6 h from index pain and were followed up for 3.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Type 2 diabetic subjects had significantly lower incidence of sustained &gt; or = 50% ST recovery than nondiabetic subjects (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the former required a significantly greater time interval through the achievement of this criterion than the latter (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In both type 2 diabetic (P &lt; 0.001) and nondiabetic subjects (P &lt; 0.001), those who had not attained &gt; or = 50% ST recovery were at significantly higher risk of cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> than subjects who had reached this criterion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The subjects who attained the above electrocardiographic criterion in &gt; or = 60 min after thrombolysis initiation were at significantly higher risk compared with those who achieved this criterion in &lt;60 min (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, this association was true only for type 2 diabetic subjects (P = 0.01) and not for nondiabetic subjects (P = 0.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is a strong predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> intravenous thrombolysis failure during <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This finding may significantly contribute to the worse prognosis for type 2 diabetic subjects compared with nondiabetic ones in this setting </plain></SENT>
