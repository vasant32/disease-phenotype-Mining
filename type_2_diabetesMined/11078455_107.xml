<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To investigate the role of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-2 in vivo, we generated IRS-2-deficient mice by gene targeting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although homozygous IRS-2-deficient mice (IRS-2-/- mice) had a body weight similar to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice, they progressively developed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at 10 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IRS-2-/- mice showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and a defect in the insulin-stimulated signaling pathway in liver but not in skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, the amount of beta-cells was reduced to 83% of that in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice, which was in marked contrast to the 85% increase in the amount of beta-cells in IRS-1-deficient mice (IRS-1-/- mice) to compensate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, IRS-2 plays a crucial role in the regulation of beta-cell mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, insulin secretion by the same number of cells in response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> measured ex vivo was significantly increased in IRS-2-/- mice compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice but was decreased in IRS-1-/- mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that IRS-1 and IRS-2 may play different roles in the regulation of beta-cell mass and the function of individual beta-cells </plain></SENT>
