<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: There were 408 patients randomized in this multicenter double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients who had HbA1c &gt; or = 7.0%, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) &gt; or = 140 mg/dl, and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> &gt; 1 ng/ml were randomized to receive placebo or 7.5, 15, 30, or 45 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> administered once a day for 26 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients treated with 15, 30, or 45 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> had significant mean decreases in HbA1c (range -1.00 to -1.60% difference from placebo) and FPG (-39.1 to -65.3 mg/dl difference from placebo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The decreases in FPG were observed as early as the second week of therapy; maximal decreases occurred after 10-14 weeks and were maintained until the end of therapy (week 26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the 15-, 30-, or 45-mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> groups, there were significant mean percent decreases in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, significant mean percent increases in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, and only small percent changes in total cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The subset of patients naive to therapy had greater improvements in HbA1c and FPG (difference from placebo of -2.55% and -79.9 mg/dl for the 45-mg group) compared with previously treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall adverse event profile of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> was similar to that of placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence of drug-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235378,C0348754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">hepatotoxicity</z:e> or drug-induced elevations of alanine aminotransferase levels in this study CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">Pioglitazone</z:chebi> monotherapy significantly improves HbA1c and FPG while producing beneficial effects on serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with no evidence of drug-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235378,C0348754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">hepatotoxicity</z:e> </plain></SENT>
