<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To examine whether the liver is exposed to higher levels of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi>, which may undergo metabolic degradation prior to measurement in the systemic circulation, we assessed concentrations of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> in the portal and peripheral circulation in morbidly <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Portal and peripheral blood samples were obtained simultaneously from six morbidly <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> humans with and without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during bariatric abdominal surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The samples were assessed for serum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> to determine whether an increase in the portal to peripheral circulation is found in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Insulin, which undergoes metabolic clearance in the liver, and thyroxin (free T(4)), which does not, were also assessed </plain></SENT>
