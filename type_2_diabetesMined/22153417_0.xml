<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A structured vignette survey was conducted in Australia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This included nine vignettes chosen at random from 128 developed around seven clinical variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Respondents were asked to recommend a change in treatment and make specific recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A random sample of general practitioners (GPs) were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two diabetologists involved in the development of national guidelines also participated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 125 (13.8%) GPs participated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Statistical analyses were used to generate outcome measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>GPs recommended a change in treatment for most (81.1%) cases; were less likely to prescribe a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> (68.5% GPs vs. 76.3% diabetologists), less likely to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (66.7% vs.89%) and less likely to refer for lifestyle modification (82.3% vs. 96.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significant disagreement occurred around prescribing or changing oral hypoglycaemics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No GP characteristics showed significant impact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The proportion of GPs who agreed with diabetiologists on dose and choice of drugs was 35.7% for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi>, 49.6% for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensives</z:chebi> and 39.6% for oral hypoglycaemics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There were significant differences between diabetologists and GPs on the management of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The survey suggests significant under-dosing by GPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These findings warrant further investigation </plain></SENT>
