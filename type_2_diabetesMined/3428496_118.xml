<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Concordance for Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was determined in 250 monozygotic and 264 dizygotic white male twin pairs who participated in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Twin Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These twins were born between 1917 and 1927 and were identified from military records without regard to disease status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined surviving members of the cohort twice--at mean ages of 47 and 57 years--and obtained 1-h post-load <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tests and medication histories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic criteria for Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> included a <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> value greater than or equal to 13.9 mmol/l or current use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> medication; possible Type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetic twins were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A strong genetic predisposition to Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was suggested by 3 lines of evidence from the second examination: (1) 58% of monozygotic co-twins of diabetic twins were themselves diabetic compared with an expected prevalence of 10%; (2) only 1 of 15 originally disease-discordant, monozygotic twin pairs remained discordant for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; and (3) 65% of non-diabetic monozygotic co-twins of diabetic twins had elevated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because concordance for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was less than 100% for twins aged 52-65 years and because twins varied in age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of disease, non-genetic factors may also influence <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the 19 monozygotic twins pairs discordant for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, diabetic twins did not differ from their non-diabetic co-twins in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, diet, alcohol consumption, or education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, compared with unrelated non-diabetic twins of the same ages, non-diabetic co-twins of diabetic twins gained more weight as adults (p less than 0.02) and had higher <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels (p less than 0.03) </plain></SENT>
