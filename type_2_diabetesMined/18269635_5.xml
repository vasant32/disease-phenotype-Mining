<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is now compelling evidence to suggest that abnormalities of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and one of its binding proteins, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1), occur in insulin-resistant states and may be significant factors in the pathophysiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We reviewed articles and relevant bibliographies following a systematic search of MEDLINE for English language articles between 1966 and the present, using an initial search strategy combining the MeSH terms: IGF, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our aim was first to review the role of IGF-I in vascular homeostasis and to explore the mechanisms by which it may exert its effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also present an overview of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> of the IGF-binding proteins, and finally, we sought to summarize the evidence to date describing the changes in the insulin/IGF-I/IGFBP-1 axis that occur in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>; in particular, we have focused on the potential vasculoprotective effects of both IGF-I and IGFBP-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that this system represents an interesting and novel therapeutic target in the prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
