<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Amylin gene mutations are known to predispose Chinese and Japanese subjects, but not Caucasian subjects, to Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>New Zealand Maori, who have a high prevalence of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, have genetic origins in South East Asia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Amylin gene mutations could therefore predispose New Zealand Maori to Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The amylin gene was screened for mutations in the proximal promoter region, exons 1 and 2, intron 1, and coding region of exon 3 by polymerase chain reaction amplification and direct sequencing of 131 Type 2 diabetic Maori patients and 258 non-diabetic Maori control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified three new amylin gene mutations: two mutations in the promoter region (-215T&gt;G and -132G&gt;A) and a missense mutation in exon 3 (Q10R) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The -215T&gt;G mutation was observed in 5.4% of Type 2 Maori diabetic patients and predisposed the carrier to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with a relative risk of 7.23 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The -215T&gt;G mutation was inherited with a previously described amylin promoter polymorphism (-230A&gt;C) in 3% of the Maori with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, which suggests linkage disequilibrium exists between these two mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The -230A&gt;C polymorphism on its own, however, was not associated with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Maori subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The -132G&gt;A and Q10R mutations were both observed in 0.76% of Type 2 diabetic patients and were absent in non-diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: The amylin gene mutations identified in this study are associated with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in 7% of Maori </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Amylin is likely to be an important susceptibility gene for Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Maori people </plain></SENT>
