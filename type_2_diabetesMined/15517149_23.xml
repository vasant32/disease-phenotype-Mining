<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several studies in humans have found associations between polymorphisms in the resistin gene and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, insulin sensitivity and blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An association between variation in the resistin gene and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> has been reported in some, but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to analyse variants of the resistin gene for association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and related traits in a Finnish sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 781 cases with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 187 spouse controls and 222 elderly controls of Finnish origin, we genotyped four previously identified non-coding single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs): -420C&gt;G from the promoter region, +156C&gt;T and +298G&gt;A from intron 2, and +1084G&gt;A from the 3' untranslated region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We then tested whether these SNPs were associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and related traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The SNPs were not significantly associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, SNPs -420C&gt;G, +156C&gt;T and +298G&gt;A and the common haplotype for these three markers were associated with increased values of weight-related traits and diastolic blood pressure in cases, lower weight in elderly control subjects, and lower insulin sensitivity and greater <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin response in spouses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the +1084G allele was associated with lower <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> in both cases and controls, higher systolic blood pressure and waist circumference in cases, and greater <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin response in spouse controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our results add to growing evidence that resistin is associated with variation in weight, fat distribution and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
