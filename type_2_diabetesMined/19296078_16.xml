<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to acquire new information about enzymes of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism, with an emphasis on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> enzymes, by comparing pancreatic islets of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients with those of non-diabetic controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Expression of genes encoding 13 metabolic enzymes was estimated with microarrays and activities of up to nine metabolic enzymes were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The activities of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> enzymes, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> phosphate dehydrogenase, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> carboxylase (PC) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15380">succinyl-CoA</z:chebi>:3-ketoacid-CoA transferase (SCOT) were decreased by 73%, 65% and 92%, respectively, in the diabetic compared with the non-diabetic islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ATP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50744">citrate</z:chebi> lyase, a cytosolic enzyme of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50744">citrate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> shuttle, was decreased 57% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Activities of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15539">propionyl-CoA</z:chebi> carboxylase, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="25523">NADP</z:chebi>-isocitrate dehydrogenase, cytosolic malic enzyme, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> aminotransferase and malate dehydrogenase were not significantly different from those of the control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The low activities of PC and SCOT were confirmed with western blots, which showed that their protein levels were low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The correlation of relative <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> signals with enzyme activities was good in four instances, moderate in four instances and poor in one instance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In diabetic islets, the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> signal of the islet cell-enriched transcription factor musculoaponeurotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100244'>fibrosarcoma</z:hpo> oncogene homologue A, which regulates expression of islet genes, including the PC gene, was decreased to 54% of the control level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PC activity and protein levels in the non-diabetic islets were significantly lower than in islets from non-diabetic rodents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Low levels of certain islet metabolic enzymes, especially <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> enzymes, are associated with human type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
