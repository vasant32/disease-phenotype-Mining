<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the efficacy and tolerability of vildagliptin as add-on therapy to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> in Chinese patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) inadequately controlled with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with T2DM (N = 438) with <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA1c) of 7.0-10.0% and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) &lt;15 mmol/l (&lt;270 mg/dl) were randomized (1 : 1 : 1) to vildagliptin 50 mg bid, vildagliptin 50 mg qd or placebo in addition to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The treatment groups were well balanced at baseline [mean HbA1c, 8.0%, FPG, 8.8 mmol/l (158 mg/dl); body mass index, 25.5 kg/m(2) ] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The adjusted mean change (AMΔ) in HbA1c at endpoint was -1.05 ± 0.08%, -0.92 ± 0.08% and -0.54 ± 0.08% in patients receiving vildagliptin 50 mg bid, 50 mg qd and placebo, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The between-treatment difference (vildagliptin 50 mg bid-placebo) was -0.51 ± 0.11%, p &lt; 0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A greater proportion of vildagliptin-treated patients met at least one responder criterion (82.1 and 70.7%) compared to placebo-treated patients (60.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The AMΔ at endpoint for FPG with vildagliptin 50 mg bid, -0.95 mmol/l (-17.1 mg/dl); 50 mg qd, -0.84 mmol/l (-15.1 mg/dl) was significantly different compared with the placebo -0.26 mmol/l (-4.68 mg/dl) (p ≤ 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adverse events (AEs) were reported as 34.2, 36.5 and 37.5% for patients receiving vildagliptin 50 mg bid, 50 mg qd or placebo, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two patients in the vildagliptin 50 mg qd and one in the placebo group reported serious AEs, which were not considered to be related to the study drug; one incidence of hypoglycaemic event was reported in the vildagliptin 50 mg bid group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Vildagliptin as add-on therapy to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> improved glycaemic control and was well tolerated in Chinese patients who were inadequately controlled by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> only </plain></SENT>
