<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although they differ in terms of their chemistry, they are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> small molecules which are orally available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There are some differences between them in terms of their absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination, as well as in their potency and duration of action, but their efficacy, both in terms of inhibiting plasma DPP-4 activity and as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> agents, appears to be similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They improve glycaemic control, reducing both fasting and postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels to lower HbA1c levels, without <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> and with an apparently benign adverse event profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At present, there seems to be little to distinguish between the different inhibitors in terms of their efficacy as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> agents and their safety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Long-term accumulated clinical experience will reveal whether compound-related characteristics lead to any clinically relevant differences </plain></SENT>
