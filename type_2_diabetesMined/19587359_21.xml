<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The regulation and biological function of FTO <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in target tissue is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the genetic and nongenetic regulation of FTO <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue and their influence on in vivo <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and fat metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The FTO rs9939609 polymorphism was genotyped in two twin cohorts: 1) 298 elderly twins aged 62-83 years with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance ranging from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 2) 196 young (25-32 years) and elderly (58-66 years) nondiabetic twins examined by a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp including indirect calorimetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FTO <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was determined in subcutaneous adipose tissue (n = 226) and skeletal muscle biopsies (n = 158) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Heritability of FTO expression in both tissues was low, and FTO expression was not influenced by FTO rs9939609 genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FTO <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in skeletal muscle was regulated by age and sex, whereas age and BMI were predictors of adipose tissue FTO <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FTO <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in adipose tissue was associated with an atherogenic <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In skeletal muscle, FTO <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was negatively associated to fat and positively to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> oxidation rates as well as positively correlated with expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation including PGC1alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The heritability of FTO expression in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle is low and not influenced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-associated FTO genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The age-dependent decline in FTO expression is associated with peripheral defects of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and fat metabolism </plain></SENT>
