<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 125 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and abnormal albumin excretion rate (AER) (range 20-5416 microg/min) were followed up for 4 years with repeated measurements of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA was extracted from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, and the PC-1 K121Q polymorphism was determined by the PCR AvaII restriction enzyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A subset of 64 patients underwent a percutaneous kidney biopsy at baseline, and glomerular structure was analyzed by electron microscopic morphometric analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At baseline, age (56 +/- 8 vs. 59 +/- 7 years), BMI (28.3 +/- 4.3 vs. 28.6 +/- 3.7 kg/m(2)), known duration of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (11.1 +/- 7 vs. 11.9 +/- 8 years), and HbA(1c) (8.6 +/- 1.8 vs. 8.4 +/- 1.7%) were similar in K121K (KK, n = 87, 73 men/14 women) and XQ (35 K121Q + 3 Q121Q, n = 38, 27 men/11 women) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Baseline GFR was 96 +/- 28 ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>min(-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>1.73 m(-2) and was related (P = 0.01-0.001) to age, known <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration, and systolic blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: XQ patients had lower GFR (P &lt; 0.05) than KK patients (88 +/- 30 vs. 100 +/- 26 ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>min(-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>1.73 m(-2)); this difference persisted also after factoring in age and known <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The rate of progression of DN was similar in KK and XQ patients: %deltaGFR was 4.1/year (median, range: 22.9-30.6) vs. 4.2/year (9.8-26.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Morphometric parameters of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100820'>glomerulopathy</z:hpo> were similar in the two genotype groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with <z:mp ids='MP_0001676'>abnormal AER</z:mp>, those carrying the Q PC-1 genotype have more severe DN but not a faster GFR decline than KK patients, thus suggesting faster DN development since <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosis in XQ patients </plain></SENT>
