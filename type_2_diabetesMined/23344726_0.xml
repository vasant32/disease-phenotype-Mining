<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relative contribution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> vs <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> to perturbations in this pathway is poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used phosphospecific antibodies against targets in the Akt signalling network to study insulin action in muscle from lean, overweight/<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and type 2 diabetic individuals before and during a hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation at Thr309 and Ser474 was highly correlated with whole-body insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, impaired phosphorylation of Akt substrate of 160Â kDa (AS160; also known as TBC1D4) was associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e>, but not insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neither insulin sensitivity nor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> was associated with defective insulin-dependent phosphorylation of forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In view of the resultant basal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020459" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperinsulinaemia</z:e>, we predicted that this selective response within the Akt pathway might lead to hyperactivation of those processes that were spared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the expression of genes targeted by FOXO was downregulated in insulin-resistant individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These results highlight non-linearity in Akt signalling and suggest that: (1) the pathway from Akt to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transport is complex; and (2) pathways, particularly FOXO, that are not insulin-resistant, are likely to be hyperactivated in response to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020459" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperinsulinaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This facet of Akt signalling may contribute to multiple features of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
