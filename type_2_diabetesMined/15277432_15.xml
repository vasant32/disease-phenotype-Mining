<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The incidence of pediatric type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> has recently seen an alarming increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To improve our understanding of pediatric type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and identify markers that discriminate these subjects from those with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we performed a multivariant analysis associating serum adiponectin and leptin levels with anthropometrical parameters and disease state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Samples from children and adolescents with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 41) and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 17) and from nondiabetic individuals of similar age from the general population (n = 43) were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An analysis included the parameters of matching for BMI and Tanner stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curves were established to assess these analytes' association with disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Contrary to studies of adult type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, adiponectin levels in our pediatric type 1 diabetic subjects (10.2 microg/ml [95% CI 8.6-11.7]) did not differ from those of healthy control subjects (10.6 microg/ml [9.2-12.0]; P = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Children with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (5.5 microg/ml [4.8-6.2]) had significantly lower adiponectin levels than both of those groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conversely, type 2 diabetic subjects showed marked elevations in serum leptin concentrations (24.3 ng/ml [17.1-31.5]) compared with healthy control subjects (2.7 ng/ml [1.3-4.1]; P &lt; 0.001) and type 1 diabetic subjects (5.1 ng/ml [3.5-6.7]; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Importantly, each of the properties ascribed to pediatric type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was present when the comparison was restricted to healthy children or type 1 diabetic patients whose BMI was &gt;85th percentile or who had Tanner stage 4 and 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The evaluation of adiponectin-to-leptin ratios revealed a striking difference between children with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (6.3 [3.8-8.8]) and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (0.3 [0.2-0.5]; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In pediatric <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, where diagnosis of disease is often difficult, these studies suggest that the adiponectin-to-leptin ratio may provide additional help in the discrimination between type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
