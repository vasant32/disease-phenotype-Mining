<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Interventions to prevent type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> should be directed toward individuals at increased risk for the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To identify such individuals without laboratory tests, we developed the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Risk Score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A random population sample of 35- to 64-year-old men and women with no <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drug treatment at baseline were followed for 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>New cases of drug-treated type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were ascertained from the National Drug Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression model coefficients were used to assign each variable category a score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Risk Score was composed as the sum of these individual scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The validity of the score was tested in an independent population survey performed in 1992 with prospective follow-up for 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Age, BMI, waist circumference, history of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive drug</z:chebi> treatment and high blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, physical activity, and daily consumption of fruits, berries, or vegetables were selected as categorical variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complete baseline risk data were found in 4435 subjects with 182 incident cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Risk Score value varied from 0 to 20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>To predict drug-treated <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the score value &gt;or=9 had sensitivity of 0.78 and 0.81, specificity of 0.77 and 0.76, and positive predictive value of 0.13 and 0.05 in the 1987 and 1992 cohorts, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Risk Score is a simple, fast, inexpensive, noninvasive, and reliable tool to identify individuals at high risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
