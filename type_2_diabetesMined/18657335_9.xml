<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The raising <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> epidemic is unfolding as an interaction between several environmental factors and a genetic predisposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the current study was to evaluate the role of the PPARgamma-Pro12Ala and ENPP1-K121Q polymorphisms on type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2D) risk in a case-control study in the Tunisian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To assess for any association of ENPP1-K121Q and PPARgamma-Pro12Ala polymorphisms with T2D risk, we analysed the genotypic and allelic distributions of each variant in the studied cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results support that the genetic variation at ENPP1-K121Q predisposes to T2D in the Tunisian population after adjustment on gender, age and BMI status (OR=1.55, 95%CI [1.11-2.16], p=0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conversely, the PPARgamma-Pro12Ala variant seems not to have a significant effect on T2D risk in our Tunisian cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the minor A-allele would convey protection against overweight in the Tunisian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In fact, the over weighted subjects showed a significantly lower frequency of A-allele than lean controls (OR=0.49, 95%CI [0.25-0.97], p=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our findings support the hypothesis that ENPP1-121Q is involved in the genetic susceptibility of T2D in the Tunisian population, while the PPARgamma-12Ala allele may confer protection against overweight </plain></SENT>
