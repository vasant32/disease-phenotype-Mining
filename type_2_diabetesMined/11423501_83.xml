<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine whether postmenopausal women with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> experienced a higher incidence of hip fracture than women without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A prospective cohort of 32,089 postmenopausal women residing in Iowa were surveyed by mail in 1986 and followed for 11 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> status and other potential risk factors were assessed by questionnaires at baseline; incidence of hip fracture was ascertained by follow-up questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 490 hip fractures were reported over 306,900 person-years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for age, smoking status, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> use, BMI, and waist-to-hip ratio, women with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 47) were 12.25 times (95% CI 5.05-29.73) more likely to report an incident hip fracture than women without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had a 1.70-fold higher risk (1.21-2.38) of incident hip fracture than women without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Longer duration of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was associated with higher incidence, as was use of insulin or oral <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> medications in women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, women who were initially free of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> but in whom <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> developed had a relative risk of hip fracture of 1.60 (1.14-2.25) compared with women who never had <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Postmenopausal women who have <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or in whom <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> develops are at higher risk for hip fracture than nondiabetic postmenopausal women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Strategies to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> and/or falling may be especially warranted in women with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
