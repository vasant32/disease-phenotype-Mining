<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To estimate the occurrence of early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> renal involvement in a nationwide population-based cohort of young adults with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Sweden and relate the findings to glycemic control, type of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, sex, smoking, and blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Incidence Study in Sweden aims to register <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> incident cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the age-group 15-34 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 1987-1988, 806 patients were reported and invited to participate in a follow-up study focusing on microvascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of them, 469 subjects participated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The assessment was based on questionnaires (n = 469), blood samples (n = 424), urine samples (n = 251) and, when appropriate, medical records (n = 186) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the follow-up time, median 9 years (range 6-12), 31 of 469 patients (6.6%) with incipient or overt diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> (i.e., micro- or macroalbuminuria) were found, 24 of 426 (5.6%) in type 1 and 7 of 43 (16%) in type 2 diabetic subjects (P = 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, 24 of 31 patients (77%) had <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> and 7 (23%) had macroalbuminuria, which mainly occurred in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a Cox regression analysis, high mean HbA(1c) during the follow-up period and <z:mp ids='MP_0002842'>high blood pressure</z:mp> at follow-up increased the risk of developing signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> (P = 0.020 and P = 0.003, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, those with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> tended to have an increased risk of renal involvement (P = 0.054) when adjusting for sex, tobacco use, glycemic control, and blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite modern treatment and self-monitoring of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, young adult patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may still develop renal involvement during the first 10 years of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Inadequate HbA(1c), <z:mp ids='MP_0002842'>high blood pressure</z:mp>, and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> appear to be risk markers for early occurrence of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
