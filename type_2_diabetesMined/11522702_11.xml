<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the associations in a large population-based sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 1,685 subjects (935 women and 750 men, aged 58.7 +/- 12.4 years) from a cohort population (n = 3,706) of the Funagata <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study were divided into three groups according to genotypes: Trp/Trp (n = 1,155), Trp/Arg (n = 486), and Arg/Arg (n = 44) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> tolerance was diagnosed according to the 1985 World Health Organization criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects who had a BMI &gt; or =30 kg/m(2) were considered <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Associations with the traits related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> were also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The chi(2) test and analysis of variance were used for the association studies and to assess the differences in the traits' values, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: More subjects with genotype Arg/Arg were <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and had <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (13.6% for each) than those with genotype Trp/Trp (3.29%, P &lt; 0.001; and 4.16%, P = 0.007, respectively) or genotype Trp/Arg (2.06%, P &lt; 0.001; and 5.97%, P = 0.051, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in the frequencies of occurrence of these conditions were observed between genotypes Trp/Arg and Trp/Trp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Traits related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, such as percent body fat (28.82 +/- 7.95 vs. 25.93 +/- 7.21, P = 0.038) and BMI (25.07 +/- 3.84 vs. 23.63 +/- 3.18, P = 0.018), were higher in the genotype Arg/Arg than in the genotype Trp/Trp groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Genotype Arg/Arg, but not Trp/Arg, of the beta(3)-adrenergic receptor was associated with both <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a large Japanese sample </plain></SENT>
