<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: High habitual coffee consumption has been associated with a lower risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but data on lower levels of consumption and on different types of coffee are sparse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study including 88,259 U.S. women of the Nurses' Health Study II aged 26-46 years without history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Consumption of coffee and other <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi>-containing foods and drinks was assessed in 1991, 1995, and 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We documented 1,263 incident cases of confirmed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> between 1991 and 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After adjustment for potential confounders, the relative risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 0.87 (95% CI 0.73-1.03) for one cup per day, 0.58 (0.49-0.68) for two to three cups per day, and 0.53 (0.41-0.68) for four or more cups per day compared with nondrinkers (P for trend &lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Associations were similar for caffeinated (0.87 [0.83-0.91] for a one-cup increment per day) and decaffeinated (0.81 [0.73-0.90]) coffee and for filtered (0.86 [0.82-0.90]) and instant (0.83 [0.74-0.93]) coffee </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Tea consumption was not substantially associated with risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (0.88 [0.64-1.23] for four or more versus no cups per day; P for trend = 0.81) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that moderate consumption of both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee may lower risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in younger and middle-aged women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Coffee constituents other than <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi> may affect the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
