<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to examine whether small <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> derived from the catalytic domain of GRK2 and -3 would ameliorate Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in three separate animal models of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> derived from a kinase-substrate interaction site in GRK2/3 were initially screened for their effect on in vitro melanogenesis, a GRK-mediated process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most effective <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> were administered intraperitoneally, utilising a variety of dosing regimens, to Psammomys obesus gerbils, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats, or db/db mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The metabolic effects of these <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> were assessed by measuring fasting and fed blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi>, KRX-683(107) and KRX-683(124), significantly reduced fed-state blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels in the diabetic Psammomys obesus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In animals treated with KRX-683(124) at a dose of 12.5 mg/kg weekly for 7 weeks, ten of eleven treated animals responded with mean blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> significantly lower than controls (4.7+/-0.4 vs 16.8+/-0.8 mmol/l, p&lt;/=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant reductions in blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> compared with controls were also seen in ZDF rats administered KRX-683(124) and in db/db mice, which had significantly reduced fasting and 2-hour postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels after the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Sequence-based <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> derived from GRK2/3 have an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> effect demonstrated in three different animal models of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By modulating GRK2/3 activity, these <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> enhance GPCR-initiated signal transduction, resulting in improved <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sequence-based <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> modulation of GRK could prove useful in the treatment of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
