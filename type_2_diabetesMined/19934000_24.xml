<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was undertaken to increase our understanding of the mechanisms by which this gene affects type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Eight subjects with risk-conferring TCF7L2 genotypes (TT or TC at rs7903146) and 10 matched subjects with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> genotype (CC) underwent 5-h oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT), isoglycemic intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion, and graded <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion (GGI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mathematical modeling was used to quantify insulin-secretory profiles during OGTT and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incretin effect was assessed from ratios of the insulin secretory rates (ISR) during oral and isoglycemic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dose-response curves relating insulin secretion to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations were derived from the GGI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: beta-cell responsivity to oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was 50% lower (47 +/- 4 vs. 95 +/- 15 x 10(9) min(-1); P = 0.01) in the group of subjects with risk-conferring TCF7L2 genotypes compared with control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incretin effect was also reduced by 30% (32 +/- 4 vs. 46 +/- 4%; P = 0.02) in the at-risk group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The lower incretin effect occurred despite similar <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent insulinotropic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (GIP) and glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> 1 (GLP-1) responses to oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The ISR response to intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> over a physiologic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration range (5-9 mmol/l) was similar between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The TCF7L2 variant rs7903146 appears to affect risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, at least in part, by modifying the effect of incretins on insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This is not due to reduced secretion of GLP-1 and GIP but rather due to the effect of TCF7L2 on the sensitivity of the beta-cell to incretins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Treatments that increase incretin sensitivity may decrease the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
