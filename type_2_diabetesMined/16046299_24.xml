<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is currently unclear how often genes that are mutated to cause rare, early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> monogenic forms of disease also harbor common variants that contribute to the more typical polygenic form of each disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The gene for MODY3 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, HNF1alpha, lies in a region that has shown linkage to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (12q24, NIDDM2), and previous association studies have suggested a weak trend toward association for common missense variants in HNF1alpha with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-related traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on genotyping of 79 common SNPs in the 118 kb spanning HNF1alpha, we selected 21 haplotype tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and genotyped them in &gt;4,000 diabetic patients and control subjects from Sweden, Finland, and Canada </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several SNPs from the coding region and 5' of the gene demonstrated nominal association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, with the most significant marker (rs1920792) having an odds ratio of 1.17 and a P value of 0.002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We then genotyped three SNPs with the strongest evidence for association to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (rs1920792, I27L, and A98V) in an additional 4,400 type 2 diabetic and control subjects from North America and Poland and compared our results with those of the original sample and of Weedon et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of the results were consistently observed across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples, with the possible exception of a modest association of the rare (3-5%) A98V variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that common variants in HNF1alpha either play no role in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, a very small role, or a role that cannot be consistently observed without consideration of as yet unmeasured genetic or environmental modifiers </plain></SENT>
