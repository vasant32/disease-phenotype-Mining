<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With the introduction of whole genome wide association studies (WGAS) in 2007, the picture has been dramatically changed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Today we know of about 20 genetic variants increasing the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2D) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most of them seem to influence the capacity of beta-cells to increase insulin secretion to meet the demands imposed by an increase in body weight and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This probably represents only the tip of the iceberg, and over the next few years refined tools will provide a more complete picture of the genetic complexity of T2D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This will not only include the current dissection of common variants increasing the susceptibility of the disease but also rare variants with stronger effects, copy number variations and epigenetic effects like DNA methylation and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> acetylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For the first time, we can anticipate with some confidence that the genetics of a complex disease like T2D really can be dissected </plain></SENT>
