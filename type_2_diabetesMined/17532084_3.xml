<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was predicted positively by waist girth (hazard ratio (HR) 1.08, 95% CI 1.04, 1.13), smoking (HR 2.05, 95% CI 1.23, 3.39) and eating processed meats&gt;4 times/month (HR 1.58, 95% CI 1.05, 2.40) and negatively by lower alcohol intake (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.49, 0.99), preferring wine (HR 0.13, 95% CI 0.02, 0.97) and eating bush meats&gt;4 times/month (HR 0.34, 95% CI 0.13, 0.90) </plain></SENT>
