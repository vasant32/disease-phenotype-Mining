<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Excess tissue iron levels are a risk factor for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but the mechanisms underlying the association are incompletely understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously published that mice and humans with a form of hereditary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0005638'>hemochromatosis</z:mp>, exhibit loss of β-cell mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This effect by itself is not sufficient, however, to fully explain the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk phenotype associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> forms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We therefore examined <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and fatty acid metabolism and hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production in vivo and in vitro in a mouse model of <z:mp ids='MP_0005638'>hemochromatosis</z:mp> in which the gene most often mutated in the human disease, HFE, has been deleted (Hfe⁻(/)⁻) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although Hfe⁻(/)⁻ mice exhibit increased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake in skeletal muscle, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> oxidation is decreased and the ratio of fatty acid to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> oxidation is increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On a high-fat diet, the Hfe⁻(/)⁻ mice exhibit increased fatty acid oxidation and are hypermetabolic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The decreased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> oxidation in skeletal muscle is due to decreased <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (PDH) enzyme activity related, in turn, to increased expression of PDH kinase 4 (pdk4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increased substrate recycling to liver contributes to elevated hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production in the Hfe⁻(/)⁻ mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Increased hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production and metabolic inflexibility, both of which are characteristics of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, may contribute to the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with excessive tissue iron </plain></SENT>
