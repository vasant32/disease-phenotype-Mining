<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Owing to its mechanism of action, dapagliflozin could potentially affect the renal tubular transportation of bone minerals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, markers of bone formation and resorption and bone mineral density (BMD) were evaluated in patients with T2DM after 50 weeks of dapagliflozin treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This international, multi-centre, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00855166) enrolled patients with T2DM (women 55-75 years and men 30-75 years; HbA1c 6.5-8.5%; BMI ≥ 25 kg/m(2) ; body weight ≤ 120 kg) whose T2DM was inadequately controlled on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One hundred and eighty-two patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive dapagliflozin 10 mg/day or placebo added to open-label <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> for a 24-week double-blind treatment period followed by a 78-week site- and patient-blinded extension period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At week 50, serum markers of bone formation (procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide; P1NP) and resorption (C-terminal cross-linking telopeptides of type I collagen; <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3498">CTX</z:chebi>), bone mineral density (BMD) as assessed by standardized Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) measurements and adverse events of fracture were evaluated as safety objectives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-five patients (90.7%) completed the first 50 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with placebo, no significant changes from baseline in P1NP, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3498">CTX</z:chebi> or BMD were identified over 50 weeks of dapagliflozin treatment, with no significant treatment-by-gender interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No fractures were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Dapagliflozin had no effect on markers of bone formation and resorption or BMD after 50 weeks of treatment in both male and post-menopausal female patients whose T2DM was inadequately controlled on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
