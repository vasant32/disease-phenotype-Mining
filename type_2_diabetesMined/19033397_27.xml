<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 11 previously reported single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the TCF7L2, CDKAL1, HHEX, IGF2BP2, CDKN2A/B, SLC30A8, and KCNJ11 genes were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Candidate SNPs were genotyped in 506 type 2 diabetic patients and 402 control subjects and meta-analyzed with six previous association studies in Japanese patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Associations with fasting plasma insulin levels were investigated in a general population sample (n = 1,963, 61 +/- 13 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In our case-control subjects, susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was replicated in TCF7L2 (rs12255372), CDKAL1 (rs7756992, rs7754840), HHEX (rs7923837), IGF2BP2 (rs4402960 and rs1470579), CDKN2A/B (rs10811661), and SLC30A8 (rs13266634) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition to these polymorphisms, meta-analysis confirmed the association of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility with KCNJ11 rs5219, TCF7L2 rs7903146, and HHEX rs1111875 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The TCF7L2 rs12255372 polymorphism showed the highest odds ratio (OR) for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (OR 1.714 [1.298-2.263]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Odds ratio of other polymorphisms ranged from 1.13 to 1.41 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The risk allele of CDKAL1 rs7756992 was significantly associated with lower insulin levels in type 2 diabetic patients after adjustment for other confounding factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility of seven candidate genes was confirmed in Japanese </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conservation of susceptible loci for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was independent of ethnic background </plain></SENT>
