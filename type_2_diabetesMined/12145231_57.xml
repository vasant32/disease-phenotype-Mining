<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sildenafil (Viagra) is an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE-5), which is used for management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000802'>erectile dysfunction</z:hpo> in a broad range of patients, including those with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Its effects on endothelial function in these patients have not been previously assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We assessed the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and prolonged effects of a low dose of sildenafil (25 mg) on FMD in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over trial in 16 patients (14 of whom completed the study) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000802'>erectile dysfunction</z:hpo> without overt clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In these patients, the mean +/- SD brachial artery diameter (BAD) measured by ultrasound was 4.33 +/- 0.6 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After inducing FMD, the BAD increased 8% to 4.66 +/- 0.6 mm (P = 0.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One hour after oral administration of sildenafil 25 mg, FMD increased the BAD significantly by 15% to 4.99 +/- 0.5 mm (P &lt; or = 0.01), whereas it did not change with placebo (4.6 +/- 0.6 mm, P = 0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After treatment with sildenafil 25 mg daily for 2 weeks and testing 24 h after the last dose, the mean FMD was 14% (P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the mean FMD with placebo was 9% (P = 0.45) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and prolonged sildenafil treatment has a favorable effect on brachial artery flow-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> that persists for at least 24 h after the last dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further investigation is needed to determine whether this prolonged effect has clinical implications in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
