<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether, over daytime, one or several hyperglycemic excursions exist that can be general failures in the glycemic control of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In 200 non-insulin-using patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, diurnal plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin profiles were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations were measured after an overnight fast (at 8:00 A.M. immediately before breakfast), during the postprandial period (at 11:00 A.M. and 2:00 P.M.), and during the postabsorptive period (at 5:00 P.M., extended postlunch time) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the population considered as a whole, prelunch <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations (12.0 mmol/l) were found to be significantly increased (P &lt; 0.0001) when compared with those observed at 8:00 A.M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(8.8 mmol/l), at 2:00 P.M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(10.5 mmol/l), and at 5:00 P.M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(8.6 mmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similar significant excursions (P &lt; 0.0001) in prelunch <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> were observed within subsets of patients selected from the following criteria: 1) body weight, 2) HbA(1c), 3) categories of treatment, and 4) residual beta-cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>From the calculation of areas under the daytime <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> curves, the relative contributions of postprandial and fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> to the total <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> increment were found to be similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excursions over morning periods seem to be a permanent failure in non-insulin-using patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, whatever the clinical (BMI), biological (HbA(1c)), therapeutic, and pathophysiological (residual beta-cell function) status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Midmorning <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> testing should be recommended for detecting such abnormalities and for correcting them with appropriate therapies </plain></SENT>
