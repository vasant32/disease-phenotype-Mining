<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To clarify the roles of them in developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we evaluated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> by HOMA-IR and insulin secretion by HOMA beta-cell in 453 Japanese subjects whose fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) and HbA(1c) levels were within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HOMA beta-cell was found to decrease in the over 30 years groups, while HOMA-IR increased with body mass index (BMI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To analyze the reserve capacity of insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity, the 67 of them, who underwent a standard oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test and were diagnosed with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (NGT), were divided into four degrees of BMI age-adjusted to 50 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were compared for insulinogenic index and ISI composite proposed by Matsuda and DeFronzo across the range of BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ISI composite was significantly less in the highest BMI group, while insulin secretion did not increase in the higher BMI groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The subjects with higher BMI had remarkably lower insulinogenic indices than those with lower BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that insulin secretory reserve is insufficient to compensate for increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in Japanese people with NGT at about 50 years of age </plain></SENT>
