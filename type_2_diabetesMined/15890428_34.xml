<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The objective of this national, cross-sectional study was to provide insight into the care and treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2DM) in the Canadian primary care setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Specifically, the study examines glycemic control, management and morbidity load among T2DM patients, and investigates the relationship of glycemic control and morbidity load with duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participating primary care physicians (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCPs</z:e>) (N=243) completed a chart audit for the first 10 patients with T2DM attending their clinics (2473 eligible patient records) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean A1C was 7.3% with 49% of patients not at target (A1C&gt;or=7.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Glycemic control eroded significantly with increasing duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in spite of increasing therapeutic intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>T2DM patients experienced a high morbidity load (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> 63%; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> 59%; macrovascular complications 28%; microvascular complications 38%) each of which increased significantly with duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For 79% of patients not at target, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCPs</z:e> identified lifestyle intervention as the strategy for achieving glycemic targets while more aggressive treatment plans were identified for only 56% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results underscore the complexity of primary care management of T2DM and suggest that current treatment approaches are not intensive enough for a large proportion of patients especially those with longer duration of disease </plain></SENT>
