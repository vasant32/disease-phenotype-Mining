<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 6 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were studied with 4-h isoglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamps (approximately 8 mmol/l and 500-600 pmol/l, respectively) before treatment (Prestudy), after 3 weeks of thalidomide (150 mg orally at bedtime), and after 3 weeks of placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thalidomide reduced insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake by 31% (from 27.7 to 19.2 pmol x kg(-1) x min(-1), P &lt; 0.05) compared with the prestudy and by 21% (from 24.2 to 19.2 pmol x kg(-1) x min(-1), P &lt; 0.05) compared with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thalidomide also reduced insulin-stimulated GS by 48% (from 14.1 to 8.2 micromol x kg(-1) x min(-1), P &lt; 0.05) compared with the prestudy and by 40% (from 13.6 to 8.2 micromol x kg(-1) x min(-1), P &lt; 0.5) compared with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thalidomide had no effect on rates of GLS, carbohydrate oxidation, nonoxidative GLS, lipolysis, FFA oxidation, and reesterification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that thalidomide increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by inhibiting insulin-stimulated GS and that patients taking thalidomide should be monitored for possible deterioration in their <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
