<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study population consisted of 309 siblings of diabetic (DM+) or nondiabetic (DM-) probands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Risk factors, including <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi>, blood pressure, and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance status, were measured at the baseline study and 8 years later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Siblings in the DM+ group had a significantly higher risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (odds ratio [OR] = 3.25; P = 0.002) than siblings in the DM- group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Altogether, factor analyses revealed four significant factors in both the DM+ and DM- groups (the percentage of cumulative variance explained 62-66%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these, factor 1 (percentage of variance, 27-29%) was characterized by high loadings for BMI, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> area, insulin area (the highest loading), and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> in both the DM+ and DM- groups; therefore, factor 1 can be interpreted as a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also, other factors were essentially similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>Hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> factor was similarly associated with the risk of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the DM+ group (OR = 4.33, 95% CI 2.29-8.19; P &lt; 0.001) and the DM- group (OR = 4.22, 95% CI 2.02-8.81; P &lt; 0.001) in logistic regression analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that a cluster of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> around <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> is an important predictor of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in 8-year follow-up independent of family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
