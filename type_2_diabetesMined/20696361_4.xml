<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of our study was to assess QoL in a clinical sample of patients with T2DM and its association with depressive symptoms and glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred outpatients from a sequential sample underwent clinical and psychiatric evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Problem Areas of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> scale (PAID) and the Beck <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Inventory (BDI) were used to assess, respectively, QoL and the presence of overall psychopathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The levels of glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA1c) were used as the main parameter of glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The perception degree of the QoL related with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was associated with the severity of depressive symptoms (r=0.503; p&lt;0.001), but not with HbA1c levels (p=0.117) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the severity of general psychopathology, evaluated through the BDI scores, predicted the metabolic control, measured by HbA1c levels, among the patients in our sample (r=0.233; p=0.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In our study, PAID was a valuable tool for the evaluation of QoL in T2DM and the screening of depressive symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, no correlation observed between PAID scores and HbA1c levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Self-perception evaluation of T2DM patient can help to identify susceptible subjects to current <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
