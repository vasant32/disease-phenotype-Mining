<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to evaluate the effects of DHEA administration on <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, pentosidine concentration, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF)-alpha/TNF-alpha receptor system activity in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty patients were enrolled in the study and randomly assigned to the DHEA (n = 10) or placebo (n = 10) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty healthy sex- and age-matched subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels served as control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DHEA was given as a single daily dose of 50 mg for 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>Oxidative stress</z:mp> parameters were significantly higher in diabetic patients versus control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pentosidine levels, as well as soluble TNF receptor (sTNF-R)I and sTNF-RII, were also higher in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After DHEA, plasma levels of reactive oxygen species and hydroxynonenal dropped by 53 and 47%, respectively, whereas the nonenzymatic <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> and vitamin E increased (+38 and +76%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The same changes in oxidative parameters were detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DHEA treatment also induced a marked decrease of pentosidine plasma concentration in diabetic patients (-50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the TNF-alpha/TNF-alpha receptor system was shown to be less activated after DHEA treatment, in both plasma and PBMCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Data indicate that DHEA treatment ameliorates the oxidative imbalance induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, downregulates the TNF-alpha/TNF-alpha receptor system, and prevents advanced glycation end product formation, suggesting a beneficial effect on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and/or progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> complications in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
