<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>At late fetal age (21.5 days postcoitum [dpc]), GK rats present a severely reduced beta-cell mass compared with Wistar rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This anomaly largely antedates the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> in GK rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, the beta-cell mass deficit could represent the primary defect leading to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the adult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this work was to investigate, in GK fetuses at the end of fetal age (21.5 dpc), whether impaired availability of growth factors such as insulin, growth hormone, and IGFs and their IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs) could be instrumental in this anomaly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although it confirms that GK fetuses are hypoinsulinemic despite enhanced plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level due to maternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, the present study shows for the first time that IGF-2 expression in the liver and pancreas and IGF-2 serum levels are decreased in GK fetuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum level as well as liver and pancreatic <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of IGFBP-2 were found to be <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in GK fetuses, whereas serum level and liver <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of IGFBP-1 were increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, we found that the maximal beta-cell mitogenic response to IGFs in vitro is kept intact, therefore suggesting that the direct biological action of IGFs on fetal GK beta-cells is not grossly impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, in GK fetuses at 21.5 dpc, the defective IGF-2 production appears to be an early landmark in the pathological sequence leading to retardation of beta-cell growth in the fetal GK rat </plain></SENT>
