<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To investigate the normalization of enhanced oxidative modification of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> such as increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="11230">lysophosphatidylcholine</z:chebi> (LPC) and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35923">hydroperoxide</z:chebi> (LPO) contents in diabetic subjects, we studied the effect of cholesterol-lowering treatment on those parameters in 24 hypercholesterolemic Type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Those patients were randomly assigned to two treatment groups, such as 12 patients treated with pravastatin 10 mg daily and 12 patients treated with probucol 500 mg daily for 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Characteristics of the patients including age, gender, body mass index (BMI), smoking habit, modality of diabetic treatment and the glycemic control state were comparable between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>LPC content in the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> fractions obtained from 24 patients with Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> was significantly higher than that of non-diabetic control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The abnormality was improved to the control level after a significant improvement of serum cholesterol levels following 8 week-treatments with either probucol or pravastatin without any change in glycemic control (P &lt; 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, increased LPO content in the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> fraction in those diabetics was also significantly (P &lt; 0.0025) improved by the probucol treatment and tended to be improved by pravastatin treatment (P = 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LPC contents in the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> fraction was positively correlated with LPO contents before cholesterol-lowering treatments (r = 0.41, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that cholesterol-lowering treatments effectively reduce oxidative modification of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> fraction containing intermediate density <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> (IDL) and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>) in hypercholesterolemic Type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
