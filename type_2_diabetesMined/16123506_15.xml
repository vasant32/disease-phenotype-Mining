<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review was to determine the benefits of nutritional support in patients with type 1 or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Studies utilizing an enteral nutritional support intervention (oral supplements or tube feeding) were identified using electronic databases and bibliography searches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Comparisons of interest were nutritional support versus routine care and standard versus <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-specific formulas (containing high proportions of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25413">monounsaturated fatty acids</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28757">fructose</z:chebi>, and fiber) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Outcomes of interest were measures of glycemia and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> status, medication requirements, nutritional status, quality of life, complications, and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Meta-analyses were performed where possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 23 studies (comprising 784 patients) of oral supplements (16 studies) and tube feeding (7 studies) were included in the review, and the majority compared <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-specific with standard formulas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with standard formulas, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-specific formulas significantly reduced postprandial rise in blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (by 1.03 mmol/l [95% CI 0.58-1.47]; six randomized controlled trials [RCTs]), peak blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration (by 1.59 mmol/l [86-2.32]; two RCTs), and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> area under curve (by 7.96 mmol.l(-1).min(-1) [2.25-13.66]; four RCTs, i.e., by 35%) with no significant effect on <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>, total cholesterol, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, individual studies reported a reduced requirement for insulin (26-71% lower) and fewer complications with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-specific compared with standard nutritional formulas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review shows that short- and long-term use of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-specific formulas as oral supplements and tube feeds are associated with improved glycemic control compared with standard formulas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>If such nutritional support is given long term, this may have implications for reducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> complications of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, such as cardiovascular events </plain></SENT>
