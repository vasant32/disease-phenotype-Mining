<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He was hospitalized to a private hospital and Penfil 30R was started </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, serum gamma-<z:chebi fb="11" ids="15996">GTP</z:chebi> and aminotransferases began to elevate after insulin treatment and exceeded 1000 IU/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Insulin was discontinued and serum gamma-<z:chebi fb="11" ids="15996">GTP</z:chebi> and aminotransferases returned close to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since his glycemic control became poor again, Penfil 30R was restarted and serum gamma-<z:chebi fb="11" ids="15996">GTP</z:chebi> and aminotransferases elevated again </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, insulin was discontinued and the patient was referred to the Third Department of Internal Medicine, Yamanashi Medical University Hospital because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001410'>liver dysfunction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>His plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> decreased by diet therapy, and improved further by the administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After obtaining informed consent, Humalin R was challenged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seven days after insulin injection, serum aminotransferases began to elevate again </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Lymphocyte stimulation test was negative against three preparations (Penfil R, Penfil N and Humalin R) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The present case suggests that human insulin itself can cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0001410'>liver dysfunction</z:hpo> and we need to pay more attention to liver function tests when we start insulin treatment </plain></SENT>
