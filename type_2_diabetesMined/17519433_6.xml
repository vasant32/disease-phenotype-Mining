<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We sought to study the frequency of beta-cell-specific autoantibody markers in women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> mellitus (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e>) and to follow these women to estimate the risk of later development of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Of 385 pregnant women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> during 1995-2005 in the district of Lund, 24 (6%) women were found positive for at least one of the following: islet cell antibody (ICA), GAD antibody (GADA), or tyrosine phosphatase antibody (IA-2A) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The women were followed and autoantibodies reanalyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Those who had not developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> did an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of known risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> were compared in women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> with and without pancreatic autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the autoantibody-positive women, 50% had developed type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with none among the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> control subjects (P = 0.001), 21% had impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> compared with 12.5% among control subjects (P = 0.3), and none had developed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with 12.5% among control subjects (P = 0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Autoantibody screening in pregnant women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> and follow-up after delivery should be considered for early recognition of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
