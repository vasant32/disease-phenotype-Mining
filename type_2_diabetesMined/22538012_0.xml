<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We used a mixed-methods approach to explore the relationships between participants' perceptions of family members' <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-care knowledge, family members' <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-specific supportive and nonsupportive behaviors, and participants' medication adherence and glycemic control (A1C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> participated in focus group sessions that discussed barriers and facilitators to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> management (n = 45) and/or completed surveys (n = 61) to collect demographic information, measures of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> medication adherence, perceptions of family members' <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-care knowledge, and perceptions of family members' <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-specific supportive and nonsupportive behaviors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most recent A1C was extracted from the medical record </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Perceiving family members were more knowledgeable about <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was associated with perceiving family members performed more <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-specific supportive behaviors, but was not associated with perceiving family members performed fewer nonsupportive behaviors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Perceiving family members performed more nonsupportive behaviors was associated with being less adherent to one's <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> medication regimen, and being less adherent was associated with worse glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In focus groups, participants discussed family member support and gave examples of family members who were informed about <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> but performed sabotaging or nonsupportive behaviors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Participant reports of family members' nonsupportive behaviors were associated with being less adherent to one's <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> medication regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Participants emphasized the importance of instrumental help for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-care behaviors and reported that nonsupportive family behaviors sabotaged their efforts to perform these behaviors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interventions should inform family members about <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and enhance their motivation and behavioral skills around not interfering with one's <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-care efforts </plain></SENT>
