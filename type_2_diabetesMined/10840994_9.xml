<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study was carried out in Tayside, Scotland, U.K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A validated population-based <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> register was used to identify patients with type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and a database of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> prescriptions dispensed in the community was used to investigate drug utilization in 1995 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In a population of 406,526, there were 974 (0.2%) with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 6,869 (1.7%) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean dispensed prescribing rates for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> drugs (excluding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> medication) were higher across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> age-groups for diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for age, patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were 2.07 times (95% CI 2.03-2.11) more likely and patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were 1.70 times (1.69-1.71) more likely to be dispensed a drug item than people without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This likelihood was increased in every drug category, even those not directly related to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and the proportion and cost of drug items dispensed to diabetic patients was therefore higher than expected given the prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Upon projecting these results to the U.K. population, it was discovered that nearly 8% of the U.K. drug budget (Pound Sterling 350 million) is accounted for by patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (90% of that by patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the increased usage and cost of prescription drugs in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> constituting a particular burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It was discovered that 1.4% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242510" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">drug usage</z:e> in the entire population can be accounted for by the increased prescribing rate of diabetic patients compared with that of nondiabetic patients </plain></SENT>
