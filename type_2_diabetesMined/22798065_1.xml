<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> are associated with increased risk of site-specific <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have investigated whether metabolic alterations at the level of adipose-derived differentiating cells may affect specific phenotypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Growth profiles of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> cell lines were evaluated in co-cultures with differentiated adipocytes or their precursor cells and upon treatment with adipocyte conditioned media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Production and release of cytokines and growth factors were assessed by real-time RT-PCR and multiplex-based ELISA assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Co-cultures with either differentiated mouse 3T3-L1 or human mammary adipocytes increased viability of MCF-7 cells to a greater extent, when compared with their undifferentiated precursors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adipocytes cultured in 25 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> were twofold more effective in promoting cell growth, compared with those grown in 5.5 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and activated mitogenic pathways in MCF-7 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Growth-promoting action was also enhanced when adipocytes were incubated in the presence of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30823">oleate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, 3T3-L1 and human adipocytes released higher amounts of keratinocyte-derived chemokine/IL-8, the protein 'regulated upon activation, normally T expressed, and secreted' (RANTES), and IGF-1, compared with their precursor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Their levels were reduced upon incubation with low <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and enhanced by fatty acids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, both undifferentiated cells and differentiated adipocytes from <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals displayed about twofold higher IGF-1 release and MCF-7 cell growth induction than lean individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Finally, inhibition of the IGF-1 pathway almost completely prevented the growth-promoting effect of adipocytes on <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: IGF-1 release by adipocytes is regulated by <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and fatty acids and may contribute to the control of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516170" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer cell growth</z:e> in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals </plain></SENT>
