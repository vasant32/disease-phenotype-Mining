<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, multinational non-inferiority study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomised 2 : 1 to pitavastatin 4 mg (n = 279) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> 20 mg (n = 139) daily for 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients completing the core study could continue on pitavastatin 4 mg (n = 141) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> 20 mg (n = 64) [40 mg (n = 7) if <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> targets not reached by week 8] for a further 44 weeks (extension study) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary efficacy variable was the change in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Reductions in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> were not significantly different at week 12 between the pitavastatin (-41%) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> (-43%) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Attainment of National Cholesterol Education Program and European <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Society targets for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> and non-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (non-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>) was similarly high for both treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Changes in secondary <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> variables (e.g. <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>) were similar between treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Post hoc analysis showed that adjusted mean treatment differences for pitavastatin vs. <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> were within the non-inferiority margin at weeks 16 (+0.11%; 95% confidence interval (CI), -5.23 to 5.44) and 44 (-0.02%; 95% CI, -5.46 to 5.41) of the extension study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both treatments were well tolerated; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> increased fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> from baseline (+7.2%; p &lt; 0.05), whereas pitavastatin had no significant effect (+2.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Reductions in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> and changes in other <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> were not significantly different in patients treated with pitavastatin 4 mg or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> 20 or 40 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Pitavastatin may, however, have a more favourable effect on the glycaemic status </plain></SENT>
