<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to elucidate the relationship by investigating the prevalence and predictors of impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (IFG) in HBV-infected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 204 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B surface antigen (HBsAg) seropositivity for ≥ 6 months were recruited in a cross-sectional study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with DM were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Information regarding age, gender, ethnicity, residence, family history of DM, alcohol use, and cigarette smoking were obtained using a structured questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile, liver enzymes and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> Be antigen (HBeAg) were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The participants had a mean age of 33.6 ± 8.4 years and included 123 (60.3%) females, 40 (19.6%) with HBeAg seropositivity, and 29 (14.2%) with family history of DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of IFG was 52 (25.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, the independent predictors of IFG were family history of DM (OR = 8.23, 95% CI = 2.78-24.31), male gender (OR = 2.83, 95% CI = 1.17-6.64), HBeAg seropositivity (OR = 4.97, 95% CI = 1.87-13.18) and elevated GGT (OR = 7.27, 95% C.I = 2.88-18.35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The prevalence of IFG among HBV-infected patients is high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Targeted screening and follow-up of HBV-infected patients for abnormalities of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism is recommended </plain></SENT>
