<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present meta-analysis was performed to assess the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> during treatment with insulin detemir (B29Lys(epsilon-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="25456">tetradecanoyl</z:chebi>),desB30 human insulin), another long-acting insulin analogue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This meta-analysis was performed in a population of 8,693 patients with type 1 or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, who were included in Novo Nordisk-sponsored, randomised and controlled <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> trials of at least 12 weeks in duration that compared insulin detemir with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin or insulin glargine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a blinded manner, the adverse events with suspected treatment-emergent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant tumours</z:e> were obtained from these studies under three system-organ classes: '<z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Neoplasms</z:hpo> benign, malignant and unspecified (including <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>)', '<z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Neoplasm</z:hpo>' and 'Surgical and medical procedures' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conditional ORs were estimated applying both the Mantel-Haenzel and Peto methods to ensure robustness of results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Separate analyses were performed for trials comparing insulin detemir with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin and insulin detemir with insulin glargine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the first analysis, 16 studies were included with a total of 3,983 patients treated with insulin detemir and 2,661 patients treated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the second analysis, five studies were included with a total of 1,219 patients treated with insulin detemir and 830 patients treated with insulin glargine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The estimated OR for a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> diagnosis between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin and insulin detemir was statistically significantly &gt;1, with the ratio favouring insulin detemir </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a more than twofold higher <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> occurrence in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin-treated population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For the insulin detemir comparison with insulin glargine, there was a non-significant difference in ORs in favour of insulin detemir </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In these randomised controlled <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> trials, patients treated with insulin detemir had a lower or similar occurrence of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> diagnosis compared with patients treated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin or insulin glargine, respectively </plain></SENT>
