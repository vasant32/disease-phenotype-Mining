<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of these studies was to identify and characterize novel nonpeptide <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> of the GLP-1 receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Screening using cells expressing the GLP-1 receptor and insulin secretion assays with rodent and human islets were used to identify novel molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (IVGTT) and hyperglycemic clamp characterized the insulinotropic effects of compounds in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Novel low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16898">pyrimidine</z:chebi>-based compounds that activate the GLP-1 receptor and stimulate <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent insulin secretion are described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These molecules induce GLP-1 receptor-mediated cAMP signaling in HEK293 cells expressing the GLP-1 receptor and increase insulin secretion from rodent islets in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The compounds activate GLP-1 receptor signaling, both alone or in an additive fashion when combined with the endogenous GLP-1 peptide; however, these <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> do not compete with radiolabeled GLP-1 in receptor-binding assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In vivo studies using the IVGTT and the hyperglycemic clamp in Sprague Dawley rats demonstrate <z:mp ids='MP_0003058'>increased insulin secretion</z:mp> in compound-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further, perifusion assays with human islets isolated from a donor with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> show near-normalization of insulin secretion upon compound treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These studies characterize the insulinotropic effects of an early-stage, small molecule GLP-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> and provide compelling evidence to support pharmaceutical optimization </plain></SENT>
