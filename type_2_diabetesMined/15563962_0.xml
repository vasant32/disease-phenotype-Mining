<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He developed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at age 31, without history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (weight was 52 kg and height 170 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>He had bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000029'>testicular atrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level was 160 mg/dl and HbA1c was 8% at age 38 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was hypertriglycemia (290-662 mg/dl) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no abnormal peaks of IRI or CPR in the serum fractionated by gel filtration (Biogel P 30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Molar ratio of p-CPR/s-IRI was 10.8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Islet cell antibody, anti-insulin binding antibody and anti-insulin receptor antibody were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>LSH and FSH were both elevated, and free <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> was decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TSH and Leptin levels were elevated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Other laboratory data were within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CT scan revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>fatty liver</z:hpo> and horse-shoe kidney </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These clinical pictures do not match the criteria to known syndromes associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although the single case report is insufficient to discuss the C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> mechanism of action, this case may give us a hint to understand an aspect of the pathophysiology of C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>'s bioactivity dysfunction </plain></SENT>
