<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This analysis aims to evaluate the association between adverse psychosocial factors and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a search of Medline, PsycINFO, Web of Science and PubMed up to July 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The studies included were prospective cohort studies investigating the association between adverse psychosocial factors and risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 22 relationships between psychosocial factors and disease-related factors (in 14 papers), of which 16 evaluated the associations of adverse psychosocial factors with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> control in diabetic populations and six evaluated the associations of adverse psychosocial factors with the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in populations without any diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall meta-analysis demonstrated that adverse psychosocial factors were significantly associated with poor <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> control (combined correlation coefficient, r = 0.096, p = 0.006), whereas adverse psychosocial factors were not associated with incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More notably, sensitivity analyses showed that low social support was more robustly associated with poor <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> control than stressful events per se or stress-prone personality or coping style, and that adverse psychosocial factors were associated with poor control of type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The current review revealed a detrimental association of psychosocial factors with the prognosis of both type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, any aetiological effect of adverse psychosocial factors remains elusive as a result of the small number of individuals enrolled in the cohorts studied </plain></SENT>
