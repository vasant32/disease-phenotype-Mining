<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently, the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene on chromosome 10q25.2 has been linked with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among Caucasians, with disease associations noted for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs12255372 and rs7903146 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate mechanisms by which TCF7L2 could contribute to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we examined the effects of these SNPs on clinical and metabolic traits affecting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis in 256 nondiabetic female subjects (138 European Americans and 118 African Americans) aged 7-57 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Outcomes included BMI, percent body fat, insulin sensitivity (S(i)), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (AIR(g)), and the disposition index (DI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Homozygosity for the minor allele (TT) of SNP rs12255372 occurred in 9% of individuals and was associated with a 31% reduction in DI values in a recessive model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The at-risk allele TT was also associated with lower AIR(g) adjusted for S(i) in both ethnic groups, whereas rs12255372 genotype was not associated with measures of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> or with S(i) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The T allele of rs12255372 was also associated with increased prevalence of impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Genotypes at rs7903146 were not associated with any metabolic trait </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lower S(i) and higher AIR(g) observed in the African-American compared with the European-American subgroup could not be explained by the TCF7L2 genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that the TCF7L2 gene is an important factor regulating insulin secretion, which could explain its association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
