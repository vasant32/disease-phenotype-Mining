<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>Microalbuminuria</z:mp> is associated with cardiovascular mortality, particularly among individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but the mechanisms underlying this association are not completely understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>Microalbuminuria</z:mp> is known to be associated with cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002459'>autonomic dysfunction</z:hpo> (C-AD), and C-AD in turn is associated with cardiovascular mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study, therefore, was to investigate whether C-AD can explain the relationship between <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> and cardiovascular mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 490 individuals from a population-based cohort of individuals aged 50-75 years who were followed for a median period of 13.6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>Microalbuminuria</z:mp> was defined as an albumin-to-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio &gt; or =2.0 mg/mmol in an early-morning spot-urine sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ten parameters reflecting different aspects of cardiovascular autonomic function were measured and compiled into a total score of C-AD (mean of separate z scores) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The association between C-AD and <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> was estimated by multiple linear regression, and relative risks (RRs) for cardiovascular mortality were estimated by Cox proportional hazards analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After adjustments for age, sex, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance status, and other risk factors, C-AD was associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> (beta = 0.16 [95% CI 0.01-0.33]), and both <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> (RR 2.09 [1.07-4.08]) and C-AD (1.74 [1.04-2.89]) were associated with cardiovascular mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These associations did not change after further mutual adjustment for C-AD (2.13 [1.09-4.17]) or <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> (1.76 [1.05-2.94]), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Both <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> and C-AD are independently associated with cardiovascular mortality, and the excess mortality attributable to <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> cannot be explained by C-AD </plain></SENT>
