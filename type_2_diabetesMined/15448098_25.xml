<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In animal models, interruption of the AGE-RAGE interaction reduces lesion size and plaque development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, limiting RAGE expression might be an intriguing concept to modulate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> (TZDs), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> agents clinically used to treat patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, might modulate endothelial RAGE expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Stimulation of human endothelial cells with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> decreased basal as well as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha-induced RAGE cell surface and total protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, TZDs reduced RAGE <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These effects on RAGE expression were caused by an inhibition of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation at the proximal NF-kappaB site of the RAGE promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The functional relevance of reduced RAGE expression was demonstrated by showing that pretreatment of endothelial cells with TZDs decreased AGE- as well as beta-amyloid-induced monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, TZDs reduce RAGE expression in human endothelial cells, thus limiting the cells' susceptibility toward proinflammatory AGE effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data provide new insight on how TZDs, in addition to their metabolic effects, might modulate the development of vascular dysfunction in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
