<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Physical activity and diet can attenuate systemic immune activation, but it is not known which individual components of a comprehensive lifestyle intervention are most effective in targeting subclinical <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used data from the baseline examination and the 1 year follow-up of a subsample of 406 of 522 participants of the Finnish <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Prevention Study (DPS) to estimate the effect of individual components of lifestyle intervention on C-reactive protein (CRP) and IL-6 levels, which represent the best characterised proinflammatory risk factors for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Changes in metabolic markers, dietary patterns and exercise were analysed to determine which were most strongly associated with the anti-inflammatory effect of lifestyle changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Lifestyle intervention reduced circulating levels of CRP (p &lt; 0.001) and IL-6 (p = 0.060) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increases in fibre intake and moderate to vigorous leisure time physical activity (LTPA), but not total LTPA, predicted decreases in CRP and/or IL-6 and remained associated even after adjustment for baseline BMI or changes in BMI during the first year of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Changes in carbohydrate or fat intake were either weakly or not linked to reductions in CRP and IL-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The present study assessed the individual effects of dietary and physical activity measures on low-grade <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in individuals at high cardiometabolic risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results underline the importance of moderate to vigorous LTPA and a diet rich in natural fibre, and this should be emphasised in lifestyle recommendations </plain></SENT>
