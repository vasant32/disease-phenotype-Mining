<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> is recommended as first-line treatment in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several agents can be used as add-on treatments in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most available clinical trials on the hypoglycemic efficacy of different drugs were performed either in monotherapy or in combination with agents other than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Aim of the present meta-analysis is to collect available information on the efficacy of different <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic drugs</z:chebi>, in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, in patients failing to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, or to other oral monotherapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An extensive Medline search, together with manual search of references from retrieved articles, was performed to identify randomized clinical trials comparing the efficacy on HbA1c of different agents, compared with placebo or with other active drugs, in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, in patients failing to oral hypoglycemic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HbA1c reduction at 16-36 months was considered for meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 27 clinical trials were retrieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Combining the results of different placebo-controlled trials, sulphonylureas, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> induced a reduction [95%CI] of HbA1c of 0.85 [0.78; 0.94], 0.61 [0.55; 0.67], 0.42 [0.40; 0.44]%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In direct comparisons, sulphonylureas induced a greater reduction of HbA1c (of 0.17 [0.16; 0.18]%) than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi>, and had a similar effect as insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: When combined with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, sulphonylureas and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors show a similar efficacy on HbA1c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The effects of drugs used as add-on to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy could be different from those observed in monotherapy </plain></SENT>
