<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previously, we identified a locus on 11p influencing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in families with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on mouse studies, we selected TUB as a functional candidate gene and performed association studies to determine whether this controls <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the genotypes of 13 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) around TUB in 492 unrelated type 2 diabetic patients with known BMI values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One SNP (rs1528133) was found to have a significant effect on BMI (1.54 kg/m(2), P = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This association was confirmed in a population enriched for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, using 750 individuals who were not selected for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two SNPs in linkage disequilibrium with rs1528133 and mapping to the 3' end of TUB, rs2272382, and rs2272383 also affected BMI by 1.3 kg/m2 (P = 0.016 and P = 0.010, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Combined analysis confirmed this association (P = 0.005 and P = 0.002, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, comparing 349 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects (BMI &gt;30 kg/m(2)) from the combined cohort with 289 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects (BMI &lt;25 kg/m(2)) revealed that the protective alleles have a lower frequency in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects (odds ratio 1.32 [95% CI 1.04-1.67], P = 0.022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Altogether, data from the tubby mouse as well as these data suggest that TUB could be an important factor in controlling the central regulation of body weight in humans </plain></SENT>
