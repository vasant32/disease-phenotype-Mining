<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Among 4,501 subjects from the French Data from an Epidemiological Study on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin Resistance</z:hpo> Syndrome (DESIR) cohort, 1,277 subjects (644 men and 633 women) were randomly selected for the analysis of iron biomarkers at baseline and at 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, to determine whether these parameters were relevant to pathological changes, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 231 subjects normoglycemic at baseline and hyperglycemic 3 years later were analyzed for iron biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, plasma ferritin concentrations were positively correlated with fasting insulin and fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in the 1,277 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although transferrin and ferritin were negatively correlated, transferrin was also positively correlated with fasting insulinemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Baseline ferritin concentration was an independent predictor of an increase in insulin concentration over a 3-year period (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further, baseline ferritin and transferrin were independently associated with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> over a 3-year period in the whole population (P &lt; 0.001 for both) and in each sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although negatively correlated, both transferrin and ferritin were positively associated with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of abnormalities in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in a prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results further support the hypothesis of a causative role of iron metabolism in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
