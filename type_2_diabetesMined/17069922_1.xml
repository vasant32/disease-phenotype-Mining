<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A rapid-acting insulin analog was administered at each mealtime to 40 Japanese patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> whose existing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> medication was discontinued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Approximately one-half (52.5%) of the patients achieved a minimum early morning FPG levels achievable (nadir FPG) of &lt;120mg/dL with mealtime dosing of a rapid-acting insulin analog alone; no basal insulin replacement was needed in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nadir FPG levels were independent of duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, baseline body mass index (BMI) or glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients who had been treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> needed basal insulin replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Low responses of insulin to glucagon and to arginine, and high response of glucagon to arginine may explain the failure to improve FPG levels with postprandial insulin replacement alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, approximately one-half of the patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> achieved appropriate control of FPG by rapid-acting insulin analog monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Basal insulin secretory defects in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may be estimated by the responses of insulin to glucagon and to arginine and the response of glucagon to arginine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study contributes to a better understanding of the pathophysiology contributing to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in the characteristics of insulin secretion in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
