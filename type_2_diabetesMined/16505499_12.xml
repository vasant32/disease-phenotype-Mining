<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the effect of <z:chebi fb="74" ids="28073">chromium</z:chebi> treatment on glycemic control in a Western population of insulin-dependent patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this 6-month double-blind study, patients with an HbA(1c) (A1C) &gt;8% and insulin requirements of &gt;50 units/day were randomly assigned to receive treatment with placebo or 500 or 1,000 mug <z:chebi fb="74" ids="28073">chromium</z:chebi> daily in the form of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50369">chromium picolinate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary efficacy parameter was a change in A1C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Secondary end points were changes in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile, BMI, blood pressure, and insulin requirements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In this per-protocol analysis (n = 46), the decrease in A1C was approximately equal across the three groups (0.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had a BMI &gt;25 kg/m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No differences were found in the secondary end points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found a weak relationship between an increasing serum <z:chebi fb="74" ids="28073">chromium</z:chebi> concentration and improvement of the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence that high-dose <z:chebi fb="74" ids="28073">chromium</z:chebi> treatment is effective in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> Western patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
