<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Data on the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>chronic renal failure</z:hpo> from population-based studies in Caucasian type 2 diabetic patients are lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To provide such data, a population-based cohort of type 2 diabetic patients was identified in Casale Monferrato, Italy, and prospectively examined from 1991 to 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: During the follow-up period, patients were regularly examined with centralized measurements of plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> and HbA(1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Independent predictors of progression to renal events were identified with multivariate Cox proportional hazards modeling, with sex, age, and individual follow-up time as confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We followed 1,408 of 1,540 (91.4%) patients (average follow-up time 6.7 years, range 0.011-11.1); 10 new cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e> and 72 of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>chronic renal failure</z:hpo> (plasma values of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> &gt;or=2.0 mg/dl) were identified, giving incidence rates/1,000 person-years of 1.04 (95% CI 0.56-1.94) and 7.63 (6.06-9.61), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cumulative risks for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>chronic renal failure</z:hpo> adjusted for competing mortality were 6.1 and 9.3% after 20 and 30 years from diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Incidence rates and cumulative risks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>chronic renal failure</z:hpo> defined by plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> values &gt;1.5 mg/dl increased to 13.1/1,000 person-years, 8.6 and 14.8%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In Cox regression analysis, predictors of progression (after adjustment for confounders) were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (P = 0.078), diastolic blood pressure (P = 0.034), BMI (P = 0.03), and albumin excretion rate (AER) (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence that the individual risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>chronic renal failure</z:hpo> is low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>AER and diastolic blood pressure are independent predictors of progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings underline the relevance of primary prevention to reduce the number of diabetic patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
