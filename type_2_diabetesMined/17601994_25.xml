<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Recently, variants in the TCF7L2 gene have been reported to be associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> across multiple Europid populations, but only one small sample of African-American type 2 diabetic patients has been examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to investigate the importance of TCF7L2 in a larger African-American case-control population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We investigated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in six known type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> genes in 577 African-American case subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> enriched for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> and 596 African-American control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we genotyped 70 ancestry-informative markers (AIMs) to apply adjustments for differences in ancestral proportions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The most significant associations were observed with TCF7L2 intron 3 SNPs rs7903146 (additive P = 4.10 x 10(-6), odds ratio [OR] 1.51; admixture-adjusted P(a) = 3.77 x 10(-6)) and rs7901695 (P = 0.001, OR 1.30; P(a) = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 2-SNP haplotype containing these SNPs was also associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P = 3 x 10(-5)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Modest associations were also seen with TCF7L2 intron 4 SNPs rs7895340, rs11196205, and rs12255372 (0.01 &lt; P &lt; 0.05; 0.03 &lt; P(a) &lt; 0.08), as well as with ATP-sensitive inwardly rectifying <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channel subunit Kir6.2 (KCNJ11) and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4-alpha (HNF4A) SNPs (0.01 &lt; P &lt; 0.05; 0.01 &lt; P(a) &lt; 0.41) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant associations were detected with genotyped calpain 10 (CAPN10), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG), and transcription factor 1 (TCF1) SNPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that variants in the TCF7L2 gene significantly contribute to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility in African-American populations </plain></SENT>
