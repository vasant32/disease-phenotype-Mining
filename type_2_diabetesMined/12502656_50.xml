<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We describe the direct medical costs, direct nonmedical costs, and indirect costs of the placebo, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, and intensive lifestyle interventions over the 3-year study period of the DPP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Resource use and cost are summarized from the perspective of a large health system and society </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Research costs are excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The direct medical cost of laboratory tests to identify one subject with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) was $139 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Over 3 years, the direct medical costs of the interventions were $79 per participant in the placebo group, $2,542 in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> group, and $2,780 in the lifestyle group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The direct medical costs of care outside the DPP were $272 less per participant in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> group and $432 less in the lifestyle group compared with the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Direct nonmedical costs were $9 less per participant in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> group and $1,445 greater in the lifestyle group compared with the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Indirect costs were $230 greater per participant in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> group and $174 less in the lifestyle group compared with the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>From the perspective of a health system, the cost of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> intervention relative to the placebo intervention was $2,191 per participant and the cost of the lifestyle intervention was $2,269 per participant over 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>From the perspective of society, the cost of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> intervention relative to the placebo intervention was $2,412 per participant and the cost of the lifestyle intervention was $3,540 per participant over 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and lifestyle interventions are associated with modest incremental costs compared with the placebo intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The evaluation of costs relative to health benefits will determine the value of these interventions to health systems and society </plain></SENT>
