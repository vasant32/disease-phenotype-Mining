<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we evaluated DM 2 women in order to compare and analyze the relationships between VT and LT intensities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifteen women with DM 2 without complications and comorbidities (50.7 +/- 8.0 years; 71.3 +/- 8.6 kg; 154 +/- 5 cm; 37.8 +/- 3.9% fat; 4.7 +/- 3.2 years of disease diagnose and 138 +/- 45 mg/dl fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>) were subjected to a graded treadmill test-initial velocity and increments of 1 km/h every 2 min until voluntary exhaustion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>VT was determined from V(E)/V(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>) and V(E)-V(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi>) ratios and LT was defined as the point at which a first increase in blood <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> occurs during incremental test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results showed no significant differences (p &gt; 0.05) and significant correlations between VT and LT expressed in velocity (4.7 +/- 0.7 versus 4.6 +/- 0.7 km/h, r = 0.62), absolute V(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>) (1.27 +/- 0.33 versus 1.24 +/- 0.28 l min(-1), r = 0.93); relative V(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>) (18.3 +/- 5.7 versus 17.6 +/- 4.6 ml kg(-1) min(-1), r = 0.84) and %V(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>(max)) (80 +/- 12 versus 78 +/- 10%, r = 0.82) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that both VT and LT can be used to access AT in DM 2 women during graded treadmill exercise </plain></SENT>
