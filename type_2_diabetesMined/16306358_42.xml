<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it has been difficult to investigate this in diseases such as type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> because of the inability to isolate primary renal cells from patients without a renal biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report here a method for the immunomagnetic isolation and novel primary culture of human exfoliated proximal tubular epithelial cells (HEPTECs) from fresh urine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary isolates are highly enriched and differentiated and express characteristic proximal tubular phenotypic markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They continue to express the proximal tubular markers CD13/aminopeptidase-N, <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> cotransporter (SGLT) 2, and alkaline phosphatase through up to six subsequent subcultures in a similar way to human proximal cells isolated from renal biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a hyperglycemic environment, HEPTECs isolated from patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> expressed significantly more SGLT2 and the facilitative <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transporter GLUT2 than cells from healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also demonstrated a markedly increased renal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake in HEPTECs isolated from patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate for the first time in a human cellular model that increased renal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transporter expression and activity is associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
