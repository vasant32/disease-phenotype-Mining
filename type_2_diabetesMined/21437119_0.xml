<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The pharmacological advantages of the rapid-acting analog, insulin aspart, over human insulin have contributed to the widespread prescription of the premix, biphasic insulin aspart 30/70 (BIAsp 30), in type 1 (T1DM) and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This article reviews the available literature on the pharmacology, efficacy and safety of BIAsp 30 in T1DM and T2DM from an online search of the PubMed database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Following injection, BIAsp 30 reaches higher plasma insulin levels more quickly than human premix or basal insulin, giving effective reduction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011998'>postprandial hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In T1DM patients, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that HbA(1c) reduction is similar, but postprandial glycemic control is better, with BIAsp 30 than with human insulin regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In T2DM patients, lowering of HbA(1c) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011998'>postprandial hyperglycemia</z:hpo> with BIAsp 30 compare favorably with optimized oral antidiabetes drug treatment, insulin glargine, and, in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients, human premix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An increase in minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> with BIAsp 30 relative to basal insulin has been reported in T2DM patients, but major and nocturnal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> rates are generally low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Findings from RCTs in T2DM patients are supported by large observational studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In summary, BIAsp 30 once to three times daily represents a simple and effective tool for the modern management of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
