<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assess the influence of dairy products on 9-year incident MetS and on impaired fasting glycemia and/or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (IFG/T2D) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Men and women who completed a food frequency questionnaire at baseline and after 3 years were studied (n = 3,435) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression models were used to study associations between the average year 0 and year 3 consumption of milk and dairy products, cheese, dietary calcium density, and incident MetS and IFG/T2D after adjusting for 1) sex, age, alcohol, smoking, physical activity, fat intake and 2) additionally for BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Associations between dairy products and continuous variables were studied by repeated-measures ANCOVA, using the same covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Dairy products other than cheese, and dietary calcium density, were inversely associated with incident MetS and IFG/T2D; cheese was negatively associated with incident MetS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three parameters were associated with lower diastolic blood pressure, and with a lower BMI gain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Higher cheese intake and calcium density were associated with a lower increase in waist circumference and lower <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Calcium density was also associated with a lower systolic blood pressure and a lower 9-year increase in plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A higher consumption of dairy products and calcium was associated with a lower 9-year incidence of MetS and IFG/T2D in a large cohort drawn from the general population </plain></SENT>
