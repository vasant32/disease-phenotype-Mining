<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>S100A8 and S100A9 were accumulated in <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>High serum levels of S100A8/A9 are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndrome and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, association between serum S100A8/A9 levels and vulnerable plaque remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated the relation between serum S100A8/A9 levels and relative plaque density (RPD) of the carotid artery determined by ultrasonography in T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study subjects were 72 consecutive T2DM outpatients (males/females=42/30), who underwent the carotid artery ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RPD in the carotid artery was calculated by the formula; RPD=[density of the carotid plaque/density of vessel lumen] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of adiponectin and S100A8/A9 were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median RPD was 2.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with low RPD (â‰¤2.1) were significantly more likely to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, and peripheral artery disease, and higher levels of S100A8/A9, S100A8/A9-to-adiponectin ratio, and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi>, compared to those with high RPD (&gt;2.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: T2DM patients with low RPD had higher prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> and higher serum S100A8/A9 levels, compared to those with high RPD </plain></SENT>
