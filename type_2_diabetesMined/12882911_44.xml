<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, although <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> B6 mice are more <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> intolerant, <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> AKR mice are more insulin resistant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To understand the basis for these strain differences, we characterized features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis in mice fed a high-fat diet for 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that despite <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo>, B6 mice have lower plasma insulin and are more insulin sensitive than AKR mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with adipose tissue of AKR mice, adipose tissue of B6 mice contained about threefold higher levels of total membrane-bound GLUT4 protein, whereas in skeletal muscle the levels were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Uptake of 2-[(14)C]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15866">deoxyglucose</z:chebi> in vivo was reduced by a high-fat diet in adipose tissue, but not in skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, no significant differences in uptake occurred between the strains, despite the differences in GLUT4; however, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> flux was calculated to be slightly higher in B6 mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Higher expression of PEPCK in the liver of B6 mice, under both standard-diet and high-fat-diet conditions, suggests a plausible mechanism for elevated glycemia in these mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, phenotypic variation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production in the B6 and AKR strains could provide a genetic system for the identification of genes controlling <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis </plain></SENT>
