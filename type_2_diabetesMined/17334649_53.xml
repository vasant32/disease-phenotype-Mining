<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most studies investigating this association have evaluated elderly individuals, after many years of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, who generally have poor glycaemic control and significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the current study was to investigate the early cognitive consequences and associated brain correlates of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: With regard to cognition and brain measures, we compared 23 age-, sex- and education-matched control subjects with 23 mostly middle-aged individuals with relatively well-controlled <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> of less than 10 years from the time of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found deficits in hippocampal-based memory performance and preservation of other cognitive domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Relative to control subjects, individuals with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had reductions in brain volumes that were restricted to the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was an inverse relationship between glycaemic control and hippocampal volume; in multivariate regression analysis, HbA(1c) was the only significant predictor of hippocampal volume, accounting for 33% of the observed variance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Other variables commonly associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, such as elevated BMI, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidaemia</z:e>, did not independently contribute to the variance in hippocampal volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These results suggest that the medial temporal lobe may be the first brain site affected by type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and that individuals in poorer metabolic control may be affected to a greater extent </plain></SENT>
