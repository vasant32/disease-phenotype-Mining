<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether parental family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> influences cardiovascular outcomes in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 1,294 type 2 diabetic patients (mean age 64.1 years, 51.2% female) recruited to a community-based cohort study from 1993 to 1996 and followed until mid-2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A data linkage system assessed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause and cardiac mortality, incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to determine the influence of maternal or paternal family history on these outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A maternal family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was reported by 20.4% of the cohort, 8.3% reported paternal family history, and 2.0% reported both parents affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Maternal and paternal family history was associated with earlier age of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, and maternal family history was associated with worse glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, maternal family history was significantly associated with reduced risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality and cardiac mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When analyzed by sex, maternal family history had no effect on male patients, whereas female patients with diabetic mothers had significantly reduced hazard ratios for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> causes (0.63 [95% CI 0.41-0.96]; P = 0.033), for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from cardiac causes (0.32 [0.14-0.72]; P = 0.006), and for first <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (0.45 [0.26-0.76]; P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Paternal family history status was not associated with these outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A maternal family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> confers relative protection against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> in female patients but not in male patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Paternal family history is associated with risks equivalent to those without a family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Some of the clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is related to maternal transmission effects with differential impact on male and female patients </plain></SENT>
