<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cross-sectional community-based study (1992-93) was carried out in Skara, Sweden, including 894 patients who consecutively underwent an annual follow-up at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> outpatient clinic in primary care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Controlled HT was defined as diastolic blood pressure (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi>) &lt; or =90 mmHg and systolic blood pressure (SBP) &lt; or =160 mmHg and was used as reference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Uncontrolled <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> was defined as <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> &gt;90 mmHg regardless of SBP level, and isolated uncontrolled SBP was defined as SBP &gt;160 mmHg and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> &lt; or =90 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Proportions were age-standardized using the Skara population as reference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of uncontrolled HT was 43% (isolated uncontrolled SBP 18% and uncontrolled <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> 25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both men and women with isolated uncontrolled SBP were older (73 years, CI: 70-75; and 73 years; CI: 72-75) than patients with controlled HT (64 years, CI: 63-66; and 65 years, CI: 64-66) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Men and women with known <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) less often had isolated uncontrolled SBP (OR: 0.4, CI: 0.2-0.9; and OR: 0.5, CI: 0.3-0.9), whereas men and women with known <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> more often had uncontrolled <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> (OR: 2.3, CI: 1.3-4.1; and OR: 3.3, CI: 1.9-5.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Men with known <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> less often had uncontrolled <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> (OR: 0.5, CI: 0.3-1.0, p = 0.04), and men with fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &gt;5.5 mmol/l more often had isolated uncontrolled SBP (OR: 1.9, CI: 1.0-3.5, p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In women, the following high risk factor levels were associated with uncontrolled <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi>: fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &gt;5.5 mmol/l (OR: 1.4, CI: 1.1-1.8), fasting <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> &gt; or =1.7 mmol/l (OR: 1.4, CI: 1.1-1.8), body mass index (BMI) &gt;30 kg/m2 (OR: 1.5, CI: 1.1-1.9), waist/hip ratio (WHR) &gt;0.85 cm/cm (OR: 1.7, CI: 1.3-2.2), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) &gt;third quartile) (OR: 1.4, CI: 1.1-1.9) and <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> (OR: 3.2, CI: 1.7-6.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Uncontrolled <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> is in both sexes related to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, whereas isolated uncontrolled SBP is related to older age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In women, uncontrolled <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi>, furthermore, is related to several other <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk factors of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients with uncontrolled <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> should be carefully evaluated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
