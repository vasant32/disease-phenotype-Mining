<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We assessed the effect upon A1C of recruitment to a clinical trial in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who had been screened and interviewed to determine eligibility but whose therapy was otherwise unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Eligible trials were selected from the global program of an insulin manufacturer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Included were studies in which patients were seen on a single screening visit, pharmaceutical therapy was not altered before randomization, and A1C was measured in a central laboratory at both screening and randomization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three trials involving patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 429) and three trials involving patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 611) were identified for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The main outcome measure was change in A1C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Separate regression equations on the change in A1C were fitted for type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and included effects of baseline A1C and the interval between the screening and randomization visits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A1C changed by -0.13% (range +0.09 to -0.26%) in those with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at a median of 28 days and by -0.16% (-0.14 to -0.27%) for those with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at a median of 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean change in A1C in those with an interval of &gt;or=28 days was -0.24% for those with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and -0.23% for those with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The reduction was proportional to initial A1C, with large decreases in those with the poorest initial control but no overall change in those at or below the 10th percentile of A1C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Recruitment to a clinical trial, independent of any therapeutic intervention, produces improvements in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control </plain></SENT>
