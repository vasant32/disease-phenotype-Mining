<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Random effects models for the primary meta-analysis and random effects meta-regression, subgroup and regression analyses were applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Random effects meta-analysis of GLP-1 responses in 22 trials during 29 different stimulation tests showed that patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 275) and controls without type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 279) exhibited similar responses of total GLP-1 (p = NS) as evaluated from peak plasma concentrations (weighted mean difference [95% CI] 1.09 pmol/l [-2.50, 4.67]), total AUC (tAUC) (159 pmol/l×min [-270, 589]), time-corrected tAUC (tAUC min(-1)) (0.99 pmol/l [-1.28, 3.27]), incremental AUC (iAUC) (-122 pmol/l×min [-410, 165]) and time-corrected iAUC (iAUC min(-1)) (-0.49 pmol/l [-2.16, 1.17]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fixed effects meta-analysis revealed higher peak plasma GLP-1 concentrations in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analysis showed increased responses after a liquid mixed meal test (peak, tAUC and tAUC min(-1)) and after a 50 g OGTT (AUC and tAUC min(-1)), and reduced responses after a solid mixed meal test (tAUC min(-1)) among patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Meta-regression analyses showed that HbA(1c) and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> predicted the outcomes iAUC and iAUC min(-1), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The present analysis suggests that patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, in general, do not exhibit reduced GLP-1 secretion in response to an OGTT or meal test, and that deteriorating glycaemic control may be associated with reduced GLP-1 secretion </plain></SENT>
