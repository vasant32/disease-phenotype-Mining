<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 597 patients treated in a randomized, open-label, 16-week parallel study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Variables evaluated: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1C (A1C), patient symptoms, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> rate (episodes/patient/30 days), and incidence (% patients experiencing &gt; or =1 episode) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For a subset of patients (N=120), fasting, 1-h, and 2-h postprandial plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG, 1-h ppPG, 2-h ppPG) in response to a standardized test meal (STM) and self-monitored blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (BG) profiles were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: improved A1C at endpoint for both groups, and A1C changes from baseline to endpoint were not significantly different between treatments (Mix25+M, -1.87+/-1.35% vs. G+M, -1.98+/-1.28%; p=0.288) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among patients completing STM; endpoint 2-h ppPG was significantly lower with Mix25+M (9.05+/-3.32 mmol/l vs. 12.31+/-3.65 mmol/l; p&lt;0.001), as was 2-h ppPG excursion (2-h ppPGex)(0.38+/-3.23 mmol/l vs. 2.88+/-1.98 mmol/l; p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Percentage of patients achieving postprandial BG targets (&lt;10 mmol/l) at endpoint was significantly greater with Mix25+M (80% vs. 48%; p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although, overall <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> rates were similar, percentage of patients experiencing and rate of nocturnal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> was less with Mix25+M (1% vs. 5%; p&lt;0.01, and 0.01 vs. 0.08 episodes/pt/30 d; p=0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients reported less <z:hpo ids='HP_0000103'>polyuria</z:hpo> with Mix25+M (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
