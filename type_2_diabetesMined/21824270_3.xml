<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The treatment is clinically efficient and safe, and associated with a low risk of adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It can be used both in early and late stages of the disease and both as monotherapy and add-on to other therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Current research on the future of incretin-based therapy focuses on optimizing its place in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treatment and examines its potential in type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, in subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> without type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and in cardiovascular and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0524851" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurodegenerative disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other studies aim at prolonging the duration of action of the GLP-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> to allow weekly administration, and to develop orally GLP-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, other investigators focus on stimulation of GLP-1 secretion by activating GLP-1-producing L-cells or using gene therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, also other gastro-entero-pancreatic bioactive <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> are potential targets for drug development as are synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> engineered as co-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> stimulating more than one receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We can therefore expect a dynamic development within this field in the coming years </plain></SENT>
