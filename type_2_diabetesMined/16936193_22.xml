<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is characterized by a deficit in beta-cell mass, and its incidence increases with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we analyzed beta-cell turnover in islets from 2- to 3- compared with 7- to 8-month-old rats and in human islets from 53 organ donors with ages ranging from 17 to 74 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In cultured islets from 2- to 3-month-old rats, the age at which rats are usually investigated, increasing <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> from 5.5 to 11.1 mmol/l decreased beta-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, which was augmented when <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was further increased to 33.3 mmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In parallel, beta-cell proliferation was increased by both 11.1 and 33.3 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> compared with 5.5 mmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in islets from 7- to 8-month-old rats and from adult humans, increasing <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations from 5.5 to 33.3 mmol/l induced a linear increase in beta-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and a decrease in proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, in cultivated human islets, age correlated positively with the sensitivity to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced beta-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and negatively to baseline proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In rat islets, constitutive expression of Fas ligand and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced Fas receptor expression were observed only in 7- to 8-month-old but not in 2- to 3-month-old islets, whereas no age-dependent changes in the Fas/Fas ligand system could be detected in human islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, pancreatic duodenal homeobox (PDX)-1 expression decreased with age in pancreatic tissue sections of rats and humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, older rat islets were more sensitive to the high-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-mediated decrease in PDX-1 expression than younger islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, differences in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> sensitivity between human and 2- to 3-month-old rat islets may be due to both differences in age and in the genetic background </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data provide a possible explanation for the increased incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at an older age and support the use of islets from older rats as a more appropriate model to study <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced beta-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
