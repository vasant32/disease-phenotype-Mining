<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Biomarkers could help to prioritise patients for genetic investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We recently demonstrated that high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels are lower in UK patients with hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha (HNF1A)-MODY than in other <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this large multi-centre study we aimed to assess the clinical validity of hsCRP as a diagnostic biomarker, examine the genotype-phenotype relationship and compare different hsCRP assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: High-sensitivity CRP levels were analysed in individuals with HNF1A-MODY (n = 457), glucokinase (GCK)-MODY (n = 404), hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4A)-MODY (n = 54) and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 582) from seven European centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three common assays for hsCRP analysis were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We excluded 121 participants (8.1%) with hsCRP values &gt;10 mg/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The discriminative power of hsCRP with respect to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> aetiology was assessed by receiver operating characteristic curve-derived C-statistic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> centres and irrespective of the assay method, meta-analysis confirmed significantly lower hsCRP levels in those with HNF1A-MODY than in those with other aetiologies (z score -21.8, p &lt; 5 × 10(-105)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>HNF1A-MODY cases with missense mutations had lower hsCRP levels than those with truncating mutations (0.03 vs 0.08 mg/l, p &lt; 5 × 10(-5)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>High-sensitivity CRP values between assays were strongly correlated (r (2) ≥ 0.91, p ≤ 1 × 10(-5)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Across the seven centres, the C-statistic for distinguishing HNF1A-MODY from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011462'>young adult-onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> ranged from 0.79 to 0.97, indicating high discriminative accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In the largest study to date, we have established that hsCRP is a clinically valid biomarker for HNF1A-MODY in European populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Given the modest costs and wide availability, hsCRP could translate rapidly into clinical practice, considerably improving diagnosis rates in monogenic <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
