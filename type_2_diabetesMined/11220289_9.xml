<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been known for years that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> frequently precedes the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> might not be a complication of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but rather the consequence of common genetic and environmental factors (the common soil' hypothesis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> syndrome (IRS) is a cluster of closely associated and interdependent abnormalities, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020459" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperinsulinaemia</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0311277" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">android fat distribution</z:e>, progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidaemia</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002155'>increased triglycerides</z:hpo>, decreased <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>, increased small dense <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>), increased prothrombotic and antifibrinolytic factors, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Many of these abnormalities are risk factors for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and most of them explain the predilection for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> to occur in conjunction with IRS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo> is a key feature of IRS, and has been suggested to be the common pathophysiological basis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The term '<z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>' denotes resistance to insulin-mediated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake into skeletal muscle, which can be measured by the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> clamp technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There are, however, other less understood sites of abnormal insulin action that may also be relevant in IRS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These include liver, adipose, and kidney tissue, and systems such as muscle perfusion, antilipolysis, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> lipase activity, and <z:chebi fb="36" ids="36916">cation</z:chebi> transport </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The development of clinical cardiovascular end-points in a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> is complex, as it includes the degree of the defect, its associated abnormalities, its consequences, and the ability to compensate for the underlying defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is therefore more appropriate to consider the different facets and risk factors of IRS in aggregate, rather than seeking 'independent' effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> per se has not yet been shown to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At the cellular level, excess insulin is involved in various elements of atherogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It interacts with cytokines and growth factors in a cross talk among vascular wall cells and a variety of mediators that play a role in the establishment of atheroma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Excess insulin also plays an important role in concert with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> when they exhibit an abnormal pattern and become modified by oxidation and glycation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It is therefore currently hoped that the introduction of a new class of insulin-sensitizing agents, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi>, may attenuate these processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> act through ligand activation of a nuclear transcription factor, the peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Although this receptor was initially linked to <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism, recent data suggest that PPARgamma is also involved in the differentiation of mononuclear phagocytes, their inflammatory reactions, and macrophage conversion to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003651'>foam cells</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Thus, PPARgamma ligands may also be important regulators of monocyte/ macrophage gene expression during atherogenesis </plain></SENT>
