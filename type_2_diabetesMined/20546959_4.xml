<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We searched publications up to 30 November 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seventeen studies were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two large prospective studies report a substantially lower risk (83% and 35%, respectively) of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in healthy people or in post-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> patients with the highest adherence to a Mediterranean diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five randomized controlled trials have evaluated the effects of a Mediterranean diet, as compared with other commonly used diets, on indices of glycaemic control in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Improvement of fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and HbA1c levels was greater with a Mediterranean diet and ranged from 7 to 40mg/dl for fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and from 0.1 to 0.6% for HbA1c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No trial reported worsening of glycaemic control with a Mediterranean diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two controlled trials in a secondary prevention setting demonstrated that post-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> patients, including diabetic patients, had cardiovascular benefits from a Mediterranean diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The evidence so far accumulated suggests that adopting a Mediterranean diet may help prevent type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and also improve glycaemic control and cardiovascular risk in persons with established <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
