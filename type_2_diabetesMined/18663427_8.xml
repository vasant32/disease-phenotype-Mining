<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to determine the effects of an exercise training intervention on insulin sensitivity in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Women offspring (n = 34) of type 2 diabetic patients (offspring age 35.6 +/- 7.0 years, BMI 28.1 +/- 5.1 kg/m(2)) and 36 matched female controls (age 33.6 +/- 6.1 years, BMI 27.3 +/- 4.7 kg/m(2)) participated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Body composition, fitness and metabolic measurements were made at baseline and after a controlled 7 week exercise intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, insulin sensitivity index (ISI) was 22% lower in offspring than controls (p &lt; 0.05), despite similar body fat and maximal oxygen uptake (.VO(2max)) values in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ISI increased by 23% (p &lt; 0.05) in offspring following the exercise intervention, compared with 7% (NS) in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increases in .VO(2max) were similar in both groups (controls 12%, offspring 15%, p &lt; 0.05 for both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasma leptin concentrations decreased significantly in the offspring (-24%, p &lt; 0.01) but not in controls (0%, NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Change in ISI correlated significantly with baseline ISI (r = -0.47, p &lt; 0.0005) and change in leptin (r = -0.43, p &lt; 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The latter relationship was not attenuated by adjustment for changes in body fat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Offspring, but not controls, significantly increased ISI in response to an exercise intervention, indicating that insulin sensitivity is more highly modulated by physical activity in daughters of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than in women with no family history of the disease </plain></SENT>
