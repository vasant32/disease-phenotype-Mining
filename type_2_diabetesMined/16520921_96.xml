<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> may occur as a consequence of having <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but may also be a risk factor for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examined the latter association by reviewing the literature and conducting a meta-analysis of longitudinal studies on this topic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Medline and PsycInfo were searched for articles published up to January 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> studies that examined the relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pooled relative risks were calculated using fixed and random effects models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To explore sources of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> between studies, subgroup analyses and meta-regression analyses were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine studies met our inclusion criteria for this meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The pooled relative risk was 1.26 (1.13-1.39) using the fixed effects model and 1.37 (1.14-1.63) using the random effects model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>Heterogeneity</z:hpo> between studies could not be explained by (1) whether studies controlled for undetected <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at baseline; (2) the method of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> assessment at follow-up; (3) the baseline overall risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the study population; and (4) follow-up duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Depressed adults have a 37% increased risk of developing type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this relationship are still unclear and warrant further research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A randomised controlled study is needed to test whether effective prevention or treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> can reduce the incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and its health consequences </plain></SENT>
