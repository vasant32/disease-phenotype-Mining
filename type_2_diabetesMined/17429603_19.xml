<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the role of two common variants in TCF7L2 in a large case-control study recruited from the Tayside region of Scotland, UK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We genotyped 6,516 participants for rs12255372 and rs7903146 and analysed the role in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility using binary logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Age, sex and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> status were examined as covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The distribution of the genotypes within different treatment groups of cases was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both variants were associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (p &lt; 10(-13)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The variants were present at very similar frequencies and were in strong linkage disequilibrium (R(2) = 0.88, D' = 0.89) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A gene dosage effect of the rare allele of both variants was observed, the heterozygote CT group of rs7903146 having an odds ratio of 1.36 (95% CI 1.2-1.5, p=1.54 x 10(-7)) for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the TT homozygote having a greater risk (OR = 2.03, 95% CI 1.7-2.5, p=1.40 x 10(-12)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An interaction with sex was observed, the males displaying a higher degree of genotype-associated risk compared with the females (p = 0.023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The T allele was associated with increased HbA(1c) levels in both cases and controls, and with <z:mp ids='MP_0006086'>decreased BMI</z:mp> and waist circumference in case but not controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The T allele was overrepresented in individuals requiring insulin treatment and underrepresented in the patients being managed by diet alone (p = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We have confirmed TCF7L2 to be a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> locus in a large case-control study in Tayside, UK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that variants of TCF7L2 may be associated with increased disease severity and therapeutic failure </plain></SENT>
