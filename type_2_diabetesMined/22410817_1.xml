<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare the incidences of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> and corresponding clinical circumstances in a German population between 2007-2010 and 1997-2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A screening for severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> was performed in the Lippe-Detmold area in Germany to sensitively detect severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This was defined as a symptomatic event requiring treatment with intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and being confirmed by a blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> measurement of &lt;50 mg/dL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> increased considerably from 264 events in 1997-2000 to 495 events in 2007-2010, which translated into an increase in frequency of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> emergency admissions from 0.68 to 0.83% (P = 0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was mostly related to intensification of antihyperglycemic therapy, particularly in the increasingly morbid group of hypoglycemic patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> indicated by lower HbA(1c), more comedication (3.3 vs. 7.7 drugs), and more concomitant diseases (3.6 vs. 4.4) (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P values &lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Within a 10-year period, there was an intensification of antihyperglycemic therapy in increasingly comorbid subjects, leading to a considerably higher incidence of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
