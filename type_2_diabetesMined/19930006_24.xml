<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: These were randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trials of 26 [Liraglutide Effect and Action in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp>-2 (LEAD-2)] and 52 weeks (LEAD-3) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomized to liraglutide 1.8, 1.2 or 0.6 mg/day, placebo or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> 4 mg/day, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> combined with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> 1.5-2 g/day in LEAD-2 and to liraglutide 1.8, 1.2 or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> 8 mg/day in LEAD-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LEAD-2/3: total lean body tissue, fat tissue and fat percentage were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LEAD-2: adipose tissue area and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>hepatic steatosis</z:hpo> were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: LEAD-2: fat percentage with liraglutide 1.2 and 1.8 mg/metformin was significantly reduced vs. <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (p &lt; 0.05) but not vs. placebo </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Except with liraglutide 0.6 mg/metformin, reductions were significantly different vs. changes seen with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> (p &lt; 0.05) but not with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Liver-to-spleen attenuation ratio increased with liraglutide 1.8 mg/metformin possibly indicating reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>hepatic steatosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Liraglutide (monotherapy or added to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>) significantly reduced fat mass and fat percentage vs. <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> in patients with T2D </plain></SENT>
