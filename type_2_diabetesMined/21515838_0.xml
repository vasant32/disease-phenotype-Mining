<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Recent reports showed that low-dose aspirin was ineffective in the primary prevention of cardiovascular events in diabetic patients overall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that low-dose aspirin would be beneficial in patients receiving insulin therapy, as a high-risk group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This study is a subanalysis of the Japanese Primary Prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> With Aspirin for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> (JPAD) trial-a randomized, controlled, open-label trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We randomly assigned 2,539 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and no previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> to the low-dose aspirin group (81 or 100 mg daily) or to the no-aspirin group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up period was 4.4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effect of low-dose aspirin on preventing atherosclerotic events in groups receiving different <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, 326 patients were treated with insulin, 1,750 with oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi> (OHAs), and 463 with diet alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The insulin group had the longest history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the worst glycemic control, and the highest prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025945" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic microangiopathies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The diet-alone group had the opposite characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence of atherosclerotic events was 26.6, 14.6, and 10.4 cases per 1,000 person-years in the insulin, OHA, and diet-alone groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the insulin and OHA groups, low-dose aspirin did not affect atherosclerotic events (insulin: hazard ratio [HR] 1.19 [95% CI 0.60-2.40]; OHA: HR 0.84 [0.57-1.24]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the diet-alone group, low-dose aspirin significantly reduced atherosclerotic events, despite the lowest event rates (HR 0.21 [0.05-0.64]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose aspirin reduced atherosclerotic events predominantly in the diet-alone group and not in the insulin or OHA groups </plain></SENT>
