<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: We compared the prevalence and treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> across Asian American subgroups (Asian Indian, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese) and Non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs) in a Northern California healthcare system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A three-year, cross-sectional sample of patient electronic health records was accessed to compare <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevalence in 21,816 Asian and 73,728 NHWs aged 35+ years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> was classified through <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9 codes, abnormal laboratory values, or use of oral anti-diabetic medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariate adjusted prevalence rates for each Asian subgroup, and adjusted odds ratios (OR) relative to NHWs, were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Age-adjusted prevalence ranged from 5.8% to 18.2% (women) and 8.1 to 25.3% (men) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Age-adjusted ORs of Asian subgroups ranged 1.11-3.94 (women) and 1.14-4.56 (men) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The odds of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were significantly higher in Asian Indians (women OR 3.44, men OR 3.54) and Filipinos (women OR 3.94, men OR 4.56), compared to NHWs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results for Asian Indians and Filipinos were similar with age-and-BMI adjustment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment rates across subgroups were 59.7-82.0% (women) and 62.9-79.4% (men) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>Heterogeneity</z:hpo> exists in the prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> across Asian subgroups, independent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> prevalence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Asian Indian and Filipino subgroups had particularly high prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> when compared to NHWs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Future studies should explore these clinically important differences among Asian subgroups </plain></SENT>
