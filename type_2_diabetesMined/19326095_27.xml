<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analysed a case-control study nested within the European Prospective Investigation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> (EPIC)-Norfolk cohort, including 293 incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> cases and 708 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We combined 16 published studies on CRP and incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a random-effect meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the EPIC-Norfolk cohort, serum CRP was associated with a higher risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after adjusting for age, sex, BMI, family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, smoking and physical activity (OR 1.49, comparing the extreme thirds of CRP distribution [95% CI 1.03-2.15], p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the association was completely attenuated after further adjustment for WHR, serum gamma-glutamyltransferase and serum adiponectin (OR 1.00; 95% CI 0.66-1.51, p = 1.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a meta-analysis of 16 published studies with 3,920 incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> cases and 24,914 controls, the RR was 1.72 (95% CI 1.54-1.92), comparing the extreme thirds of CRP distribution, with substantial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> between studies (I (2) = 52.8%, p = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Initial evidence of association between CRP and incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was confounded by central <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e>, markers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001410'>liver dysfunction</z:hpo> and adiponectin in the primary analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite an overall positive association in the meta-analysis, considerable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> existed between studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The degree of adjustment for central <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> and baseline glycaemia explained some of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> and suggests that CRP may not be an independent risk factor for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
