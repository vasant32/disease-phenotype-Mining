<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have developed a mouse model of LBW resulting from undernutrition during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Restriction of maternal food intake from day 12.5 to 18.5 of pregnancy results in a 23% decrease in birth weight (P &lt; 0.001), with normalization after birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, offspring of undernutrition pregnancies develop progressive, severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> by 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To identify early defects that are responsible for this phenotype, we analyzed mice of undernutrition pregnancies at age 2 months, before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fed insulin levels were 1.7-fold higher in mice of undernutrition pregnancies (P = 0.01 vs. controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, insulin sensitivity was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in mice of undernutrition pregnancies, with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> insulin tolerance, insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal, and isolated muscle and adipose <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although insulin clearance was mildly impaired in mice of undernutrition pregnancies, the major metabolic phenotype in young mice of undernutrition pregnancies was dysregulation of insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Despite <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> beta-cell mass, islets from normoglycemic mice of undernutrition pregnancies showed basal hypersecretion of insulin, complete lack of responsiveness to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and a 2.5-fold increase in hexokinase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these data suggest that, at least in mice, primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta-cell dysfunction</z:hpo> may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of LBW-associated type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
