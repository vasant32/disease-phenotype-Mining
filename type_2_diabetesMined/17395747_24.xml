<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> may play an important role in the destruction of pancreatic beta-cells, thus contributing to the development of type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the regulators of endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> is the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) homologous protein (Chop) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We presently studied the molecular regulation of Chop expression in insulin-producing cells (INS-1E) in response to three pro-apoptotic and endoplasmic reticulum stress-inducing agents, namely the cytokines interleukin-1beta + interferon-gamma, the free fatty acid <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi>, and the sarcoendoplasmic reticulum pump Ca(2+) ATPase blocker <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22450,38615">cyclopiazonic acid</z:chebi> (CPA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Detailed mutagenesis studies of the Chop promoter showed differential regulation of Chop transcription by CPA, cytokines, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Whereas <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi>- and cytokine-induced Chop expression was mediated via a C/EBP-activating transcription factor (ATF) composite and AP-1 binding sites, CPA induction required the C/EBP-ATF site and the endoplasmic reticulum stress response element </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cytokines, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi>, and CPA induced eIF2alpha phosphorylation in INS-1E cells leading to activation of the transcription factor ATF4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Chop transcription in response to cytokines and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> depends on the binding of ATF4 and AP-1 to the Chop promoter, but distinct AP-1 dimers were formed by cytokines and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest a differential response of beta-cells to diverse endoplasmic reticulum stress inducers, leading to a differential regulation of Chop transcription </plain></SENT>
