<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among Hispanic and Asian Americans is increasing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These groups are largely comprised of immigrants who may be undergoing behavioral and lifestyle changes associated with development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the association between acculturation and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a population sample of 708 Mexican-origin Hispanics, 547 non-Mexican-origin Hispanics, and 737 Chinese participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (MESA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> was defined as fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &gt;/=126 mg/dl and/or use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An acculturation score was calculated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants using nativity, years living in the U.S., and language spoken at home </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The score ranged from 0 to 5 (0 = least acculturated and 5 = most acculturated) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Relative risk regression was used to estimate the association between acculturation and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For non-Mexican-origin Hispanics, the prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was positively associated with acculturation score, after adjustment for sociodemographics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was significantly higher among the most acculturated versus the least acculturated non-Mexican-origin Hispanics (prevalence ratio 2.49 [95% CI 1.14-5.44]); the higher the acculturation score is, the higher the prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P for trend 0.059) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This relationship between acculturation and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was partly attenuated after adjustment for BMI or diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> prevalence was not related to acculturation among Chinese or Mexican-origin Hispanics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among non-Mexican-origin Hispanics in MESA, greater acculturation is associated with higher <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevalence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The relation is at least partly mediated by BMI and diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Acculturation is a factor that should be considered when predictors of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in racial/ethnic groups are examined </plain></SENT>
