<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The enzyme O-GlcNAc-selective N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-beta-d glucosaminidase (O-GlcNAcase) encoded by MGEA5 on 10q24.1-q24.3 reverses this modification by catalyzing the removal of O-GlcNAc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have previously reported the linkage of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and age at <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to an overlapping region on chromosome 10q in the San Antonio Family <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study (SAFADS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated menangioma-expressed antigen-5 (MGEA5) as a positional candidate gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), identified by sequencing 44 SAFADS subjects, were genotyped in 436 individuals from 27 families whose data were used in the original linkage report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Association tests indicated significant association of a novel SNP with the traits <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P = 0.0128, relative risk = 2.77) and age at <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (P = 0.0017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The associated SNP is located in intron 10, which contains an alternate stop codon and may lead to decreased expression of the 130-kDa isoform, the isoform predicted to contain the O-GlcNAcase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether this variant was responsible for the original linkage signal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The variance attributed to this SNP accounted for approximately 25% of the logarithm of odds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that this variant within the MGEA5 gene may increase <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk in Mexican Americans </plain></SENT>
