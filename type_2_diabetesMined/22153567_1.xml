<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A non-interventional, 6-month, observational study of 66,726 people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, both insulin users and non-insulin users, started on insulin detemir, insulin aspart or biphasic insulin aspart in 28 countries across four continents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Baseline HbA(1c) (±SD) was poor: 9.5 ± 1.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 6 months, improvement was -2.1 ± 1.7% in the entire cohort, and -2.2 ± 1.7% and -1.8 ± 1.7% for prior non-insulin users and insulin users </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three analogue therapies gave similar results, again independently of prior insulin use, but also from seven pre-specified country groupings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> did not increase in those new to insulin, and fell in those switching insulins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no change in body weight (-0.1 ± 3.7 kg), while <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile and systolic blood pressure (-6.3 ± 17.1 mmHg) were improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Beginning insulin analogue therapy in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and poor blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control is associated with marked improvements in diverse aspects of vascular risk factor profile without evidence of clinically significant safety or tolerability problems </plain></SENT>
