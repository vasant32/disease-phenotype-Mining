<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was undertaken in Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan, Wales </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A postal survey was mailed to a random sample of subjects identified as having <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data were collected on the symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> using the Neuropathic Total Symptom Score (self-administered) (NTSS-6-6A) and on quality of life using the Quality of Life in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Neuropathy</z:e> Instrument (QoL-DN), EueroQoL five dimensions (EQ5D) and Short Form 36 (SF36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other information, such as demographics and self-reported drug use, was also collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The anonymised data were linked to routine inpatient and outpatient healthcare data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Responses were received from 1,298 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For patients with a clinically confirmed diagnosis of DPN, the mean NTSS-6-SA score was 6.16 vs 3.19 in patients without DPN (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four categories of severity were defined, ranging from none to severe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> quality of life measures showed a deterioration between these groups: the EQ5D(index) fell from an average of 0.81 in those without symptoms to 0.25 in those with severe symptoms, the SF36 general health profile fell from 59.9 to 25.5 (p&lt;0.001) and the QoL-DN increased from 25.8 to 48.1 (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multivariate models also demonstrated that this relationship remained after controlling for other factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: This study demonstrated that severity of DPN symptoms was predictive of poor health-related utility and decreased quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it provides detailed utility data for economic evaluation of treatment of typical <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related morbidity states </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Reducing DPN morbidity should be a priority </plain></SENT>
