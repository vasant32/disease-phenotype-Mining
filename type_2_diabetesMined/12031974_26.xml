<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Here we describe a novel protein, which we have named Tanis, that is implicated in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In Psammomys obesus, a unique polygenic animal model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e>, Tanis is expressed in the liver in inverse proportion to circulating <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (P = 0.010) and insulin levels (P = 0.004) and in direct proportion with plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> concentrations (P = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hepatic Tanis gene expression was markedly increased (3.1-fold) after a 24-h fast in diabetic but not in nondiabetic P. obesus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> inhibited Tanis gene expression in cultured hepatocytes (P = 0.006) as well as in several other cell types (P = 0.001-0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, Tanis seems to be regulated by <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and is dysregulated in the diabetic state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Yeast-2 hybrid screening identified serum amyloid A (SAA), an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> protein, as an interacting protein of Tanis, and this was confirmed by Biacore experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SAA and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase proteins have been the focus of recent attention as risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, and we contend that Tanis and its interaction with SAA may provide a mechanistic link among type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
