<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although glycaemic control with ExQW versus liraglutide QD 1.8 mg has been directly compared, no studies have compared ExQW with liraglutide QD 1.2 mg or determined the probable relative efficacies of various injectable therapies for glycaemic control; therefore, a network meta-analysis was performed to address these questions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A systematic review identified randomized controlled trials of ≥24 weeks that compared ExQW, liraglutide QD (1.2 mg, 1.8 mg), insulin glargine, exenatide twice daily (ExBID), or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two studies evaluating 11 049 patients were included in the network meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean differences in HbA1c relative to placebo or each other and probability rankings were estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Estimated mean differences in HbA1c versus placebo were -1.15% (95% CrI: -1.31 to -1.00) for ExQW, -1.01% (95% CrI: -1.18 to -0.85) for liraglutide 1.2 mg, and -1.18% (95% CrI: -1.32 to -1.04) for liraglutide 1.8 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HbA1c differences for ExQW versus liraglutide 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg were -0.14% (95% CrI: -0.34 to 0.06) and 0.03% (95% CrI: -0.14 to 0.18), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The estimated mean difference in HbA1c between liraglutide 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg was 0.17% (95% CrI: 0.02-0.30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results were consistent when adjusted for background antihyperglycaemic medications and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This network meta-analysis did not identify meaningful differences in HbA1c lowering between ExQW and both liraglutide doses, suggesting that these GLP-1 RAs have similar glycaemic effects </plain></SENT>
