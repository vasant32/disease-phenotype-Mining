<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020459" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperinsulinaemia</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> are inherited and may precede the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine whether insulin receptor gene mutations, and specifically whether mutations of the beta-chain could account for the observed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, we studied members of 16 pedigrees ascertained for two or more Type 2 diabetic siblings and members of four additional pedigrees ascertained for a mixture of Type 1 and Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We previously demonstrated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> among unaffected members of these pedigrees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each pedigree was initially examined with insulin receptor restriction fragment length polymorphisms to determine whether any allele segregated with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in these pedigrees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 16 pedigrees ascertained for Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, at least one recombinant event between <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the insulin receptor locus was present in seven pedigrees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An additional two pedigrees showed no linkage if individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> were also considered affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one of the remaining pedigrees, apparent sharing of haplotypes may have resulted from insufficient polymorphism to distinguish <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> parental alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, exons 13-21 of each allele which appeared in a Type 2 diabetic individual were examined by single strand conformation polymorphisms to detect any mutations in this region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A total of five mutations were detected, but DNA sequence analysis showed each mutation to be silent and thus not likely to result in defective insulin receptor function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No mutation detected in this fashion was present on an allele which appeared to segregate with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
