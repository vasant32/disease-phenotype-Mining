<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a multicenter, factorial randomized trial of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8024">perindopril</z:chebi>-indapamide versus placebo (double-blind comparison) and intensive <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>-based regimen (target A1C &lt;or=6.5%) versus standard <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control (open comparison) in 11,140 participants with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who participated in the Action in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Vascular Disease</z:e>: Preterax and Diamicron <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE) trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Annual event rates and risks of major macrovascular and microvascular events considered jointly and separately, renal events, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> during an average 4.3 years of follow-up were assessed, using Cox proportional hazards models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no interaction between the effects of routine blood pressure lowering and intensive <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control for any of the prespecified clinical outcomes (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &gt; 0.1): the separate effects of the two interventions for the renal outcomes and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> appeared to be additive on the log scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with neither intervention, combination treatment reduced the risk of new or worsening <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> by 33% (95% CI 12-50%, P = 0.005), new <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of macroalbuminuria by 54% (35-68%, P &lt; 0.0001), and new <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> by 26% (17-34%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Combination treatment was associated with an 18% reduction in the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (1-32%, P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The effects of routine blood pressure lowering and intensive <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control were independent of one another </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When combined, they produced additional reductions in clinically relevant outcomes </plain></SENT>
