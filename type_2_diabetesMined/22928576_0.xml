<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The insulin receptor and insulin signalling proteins are present in the rodent and human β-cell and modulate cell growth and function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Insulin receptors and insulin signalling proteins in β-cells are critical for compensatory islet growth in response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rodents with tissue-specific knockout of the insulin receptor in the β-cell (βIRKO) show reduced first-phase <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and with aging develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, phenotypically similar to the process seen in human T2D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of multiple insulin signalling proteins is reduced in islets of patients with T2D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Insulin potentiates GSIS in isolated human β-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recent studies in humans in vivo show that pre-exposure to insulin increases GSIS, and this effect is diminished in persons with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> or T2D. β-Cell function correlates to whole-body insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Together, these findings suggest that pancreatic β-cell dysfunction could be caused by a defect in insulin signalling within β-cell, and β-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> may lead to a loss of β-cell function and/or mass, contributing to the pathophysiology of T2D </plain></SENT>
