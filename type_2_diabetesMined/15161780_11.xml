<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a before/after intervention study with concurrent controls in two rural regions in Alberta, Canada </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The intervention consisted of six monthly visits by a multidisciplinary health care team and was primarily directed at primary care providers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical and patient-reported outcomes were assessed after 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patient-reported outcomes included changes in health-related quality of life (Health Utilities Index Mark 3 [HUI3]), satisfaction with care, lifestyle (<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Lifestyle Form), and adherence to self-care activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of covariance was used to assess differences over time between the control and intervention regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 200 intervention and 172 control subjects were included in this analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for important clinical and demographic differences, a statistically significant and clinically important improvement in the overall HUI3 score was seen at the 6-month follow-up in the intervention region (0.06 [95% CI 0.02-0.10]) compared with the control region (0.01 [-0.04 to 0.04]) (P = 0.03 for the difference between groups) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Satisfaction with general medical care (P &lt; 0.001 between groups) and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care (P &lt; 0.001 between groups) increased among patients in the intervention region compared with the control region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Self-efficacy, attitudes, and beliefs about <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> control <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> increased in the intervention region when compared with the control region, but adherence to self-care activities did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A provider-level intervention directed at improving quality of clinical care for patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> also had a favorable impact on overall health-related quality of life, satisfaction with care, and other humanistic outcomes </plain></SENT>
