<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the long-term efficacy, safety, and tolerability of the alpha-glucosidase inhibitor miglitol in the treatment of African-American patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 345 African-American type 2 diabetic patients (mean age 55.6 years, BMI 31.9 kg/m2, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> 4.9 years, baseline HbA1C 8.7%) treated with either diet alone or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> were randomized to 1 year of double-blind treatment with either placebo (n = 117) or miglitol (n = 228) at doses of 50 or 100 mg t.i.d., titrated based on tolerability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary efficacy criterion was change from baseline in HbA1C at the 6-month visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Secondarily efficacy parameters included changes from baseline in plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and serum insulin (both fasting and 120 min after a standardized test meal), fasting <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, and urinary albumin-to-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Safety and tolerability evaluations were primarily based on reporting of adverse events and symptoms and on periodic laboratory analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Miglitol treatment was associated with a mean placebo-subtracted reduction in HbA1C from baseline of 1.19% at 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fasting and 120-min postprandial plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were reduced in parallel to HbA1C, in association with miglitol treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant reductions versus placebo in 120-min postprandial insulin levels, in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, and in fasting <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, were also seen in the miglitol group at individual study time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Softer, more frequent stools and flatulence were significantly more common in the miglitol group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000010'>Urinary tract infections</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000790'>hematuria</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019348" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes simplex infections</z:e> were significantly more common in the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Miglitol treatment appears to be at least as efficacious in the African-American type 2 population as in the U.S. type 2 population at large, with comparable tolerability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>alpha-Glucosidase treatment may be an important therapeutic option in these patients in view of their greater risk for microvascular complications and the accumulating body of evidence that better <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control reduces the risk of these complications </plain></SENT>
