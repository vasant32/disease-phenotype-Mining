<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The design was a head-to-head evaluation in a na√Øve population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Consented subjects received FPG and A1C tests and an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects were also measured by a noninvasive device that detects the fluorescence of skin advanced glycation end products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 351 subjects participated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Subjects with 2-h OGTT values &gt; or = 140 mg/dl defined the positive screening class </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 84 subjects (23.9% prevalence) screened positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The performances of the noninvasive device, FPG, and A1C were evaluated for sensitivity and specificity against this classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At the impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> threshold (FPG = 100 mg/dl), the FPG testing sensitivity was 58% and the specificity was 77.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At that same specificity, the sensitivity for A1C testing was 63.8%, while the noninvasive testing sensitivity was 74.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity advantage of the noninvasive device over both blood tests for detecting <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and precursors was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The noninvasive technology showed clinical performance advantages over both FPG and A1C testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity differential indicated that the noninvasive device is capable of identifying 28.8% more individuals in the OGTT-defined positive screening class than FPG testing and 17.1% more than A1C testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The combination of higher sensitivity and greater convenience--rapid results with no fasting or blood draws--makes the device well suited for opportunistic screening </plain></SENT>
