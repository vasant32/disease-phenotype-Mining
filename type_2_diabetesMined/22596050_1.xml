<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Evidence has accumulated that this risk is related to intrinsic differences in behavior of adipocytes in different fat depots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we demonstrate that adipocyte precursor cells (APCs) isolated from visceral and subcutaneous white adipose depots of mice have distinct patterns of gene expression, differentiation potential, and response to environmental and genetic influences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>APCs derived from subcutaneous fat differentiate well in the presence of classical induction cocktail, whereas those from visceral fat differentiate poorly but can be induced to differentiate by addition of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 or BMP-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This difference correlates with major differences in gene expression signature between subcutaneous and visceral APCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of APCs is higher in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-prone C57BL/6 mice than <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-resistant 129 mice, and the number in both depots is increased by up to 270% by exposure of mice to high-fat diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, APCs from visceral and subcutaneous depots are dynamic populations, which have intrinsic differences in gene expression, differentiation properties, and responses to environmental/genetic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Regulation of these populations may provide a new target for the treatment and prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and its metabolic complications </plain></SENT>
