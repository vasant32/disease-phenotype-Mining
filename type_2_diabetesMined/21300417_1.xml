<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 146 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 111 age- and gender-matched healthy controls subjects were consecutively recruited from Araraquara School of Dentistry to answer a structured questionnaire designed to collect demographic data as well as current and former history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical examination of the oral mucosa was carried out by a stomatologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A higher prevalence of oral mucosa alterations was found in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than in patients without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (p&lt;0.001), with significant difference to development conditions (p&lt;0.0001), potentially malignant disorders (p&lt;0.0001) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infections</z:e> (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the multiple logistic regression, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (odds ratio 9.9 IC 5.11-19.16) and smoking habit (odds ratio 3.17 IC 1.42-7.12) increased the odds of oral mucosa alterations significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> not only showed an increased prevalence of oral mucosa alterations but also a significant percentage of potentially malignant disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings elucidate the necessity of regular clinical examination to ensure early diagnosis and prompt management of oral mucosa lesions in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
