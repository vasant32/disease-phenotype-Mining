<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Previous animal studies suggest a functional relationship between metabolism, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and the amplitude of daily rhythms in white adipose tissue (WAT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, data interpretation is confounded by differences in genetic background and diet or limited sampling points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have taken the novel approach of analyzing serial human WAT biopsies across a 24-h cycle in controlled laboratory conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Lean (n = 8), overweight/<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (n = 11), or overweight/<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> type 2 diabetic (n = 8) volunteers followed a strict sleep-wake and dietary regimen for 1 week prior to the laboratory study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were then maintained in controlled light-dark conditions in a semirecumbent posture and fed hourly during wake periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subcutaneous WAT biopsies were collected every 6 h over 24 h, and gene expression was measured by quantitative PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Lean individuals exhibited significant (P &lt; 0.05) temporal changes of core clock (PER1, PER2, PER3, CRY2, BMAL1, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi>) and metabolic (REVERBα, RIP140, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15546">PGC1</z:chebi>α) genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The BMAL1 rhythm was in approximate antiphase with the other clock genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is noteworthy that there was no significant effect (P &gt; 0.05) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004324'>increased body weight</z:hpo> or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on rhythmic gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The robust nature of these rhythms and their relative phasing indicate that WAT now can be considered as a peripheral tissue suitable for the study of in vivo human rhythms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Comparison of data between subject groups clearly indicates that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are not related to the amplitude of rhythmic WAT gene expression in humans maintained under controlled conditions </plain></SENT>
