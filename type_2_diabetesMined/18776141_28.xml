<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Variants in ADIPOQ have been inconsistently associated with adiponectin levels or <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using comprehensive linkage disequilibrium mapping, we genotyped single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ADIPOQ to evaluate the association of common variants with adiponectin levels and risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Participants in the Framingham Offspring Study (n = 2,543, 53% women) were measured for glycemic phenotypes and incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> over 28 years of follow-up; adiponectin levels were quantified at exam 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We genotyped 22 tag SNPs that captured common (minor allele frequency &gt;0.05) variation at r(2) &gt; 0.8 across ADIPOQ plus 20 kb 5' and 10 kb 3' of the gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used linear mixed effects models to test additive associations of each SNP with adiponectin levels and glycemic phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hazard ratios (HRs) for incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were estimated using an adjusted Cox proportional hazards model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two promoter SNPs in strong linkage disequilibrium with each other (r(2) = 0.80) were associated with adiponectin levels (rs17300539; P(nominal) [P(n)] = 2.6 x 10(-8); P(empiric) [P(e)] = 0.0005 and rs822387; P(n) = 3.8 x 10(-5); P(e) = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) SNP (rs6773957) was associated with adiponectin levels (P(n) = 4.4 x 10(-4); P(e) = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A nonsynonymous coding SNP (rs17366743, Y111H) was confirmed to be associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence (HR 1.94 [95% CI 1.16-3.25] for the minor C allele; P(n) = 0.01) and with higher mean fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> over 28 years of follow-up (P(n) = 0.0004; P(e) = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No other significant associations were found with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> and metabolic phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Adiponectin levels are associated with SNPs in two different regulatory regions (5' promoter and 3'UTR), whereas <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence and time-averaged fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> are associated with a missense SNP of ADIPOQ </plain></SENT>
