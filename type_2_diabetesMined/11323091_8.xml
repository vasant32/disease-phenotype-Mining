<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Posturography (GRAVICHART), electrophysiological tests, and power spectrum analysis of heart rate fluctuations were performed in the following age-matched subjects: 123 type 2 diabetic patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo>, 32 type 2 diabetic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo>, and 55 healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> diabetic patients with a history of clinical neurological dysfunction were excluded from the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Significant correlations were found between parameters of GRAVICHART and some parameters of the electrophysiological tests as well as the parameters of heart rate variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The envelope area and the length per time were larger in type 2 diabetic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> than in patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> and the control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the GRAVICHART parameters between diabetic patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> and the healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Type 2 diabetic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> exhibited an inability to maintain an upright posture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The GRAVICHART can indicate the early stage of postural balance impairment </plain></SENT>
