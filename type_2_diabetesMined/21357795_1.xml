<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship of fasting indicators of insulin sensitivity with a more invasive measure of insulin sensitivity (frequently sampled intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test [FSIVGTT]) and the effect of Tanner stage and ethnicity on that relationship </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data were analyzed from 149 overweight girls (97 Hispanic and 52 African American) who were either in the early stages of maturation defined by Tanner stages 1 or 2 (52 Hispanic and 18 African American) or in the later stages of maturation defined by Tanner stages 4 and 5 (45 Hispanic and 34 African American) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fasting indicators of insulin sensitivity (IS) included fasting insulin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and the homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-IR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IS was derived from an FSIVGTT with minimal modeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In Tanner stages 1 and 2, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> fasting indicators were significantly associated with IS: (fasting insulin: r = -0.67, P &lt; 0.01; HOMA: r = -0.66, P &lt; 0.01) with no significant influence of ethnicity on these relationships </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In Tanner stages 4 and 5, however, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> fasting indicators were associated with IS in African American girls (fasting insulin: r = -0.55, P &lt; 0.01; HOMA: r = -0.47, P &lt; 0.01), but none of the indicators were significantly associated with IS in Hispanic girls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Fasting indicators were reflective of IS for girls in Tanner stages 1 and 2, regardless of ethnicity and may provide a clinical measure of future risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the latter stages of maturation, however, more invasive measures are warranted to adequately determine IS in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
