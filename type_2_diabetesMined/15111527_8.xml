<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Based on a hypothetical teleophthalmology system to evaluate diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a prison care setting, a Markov decision model was developed with probability and cost data derived primarily from published epidemiological and outcome studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 40-year-old African-American man with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was used as a reference case subject </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The number of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained was used as the clinical outcome, and the cost in U.S. dollars from the year 2003 was used as the economic outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Teleophthalmology and nonteleophthalmology strategies were compared using an expected QALYs calculation and two types of sensitivity analyses: probabilistic and traditional n-way sensitivity analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The teleophthalmology strategy dominates in the cost-effectiveness analysis for the reference case subject: 16,514/18.73 dollars QALYs for teleophthalmology and 17,590/18.58 dollars QALYs for nonteleophthalmology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ninety percent of the Monte Carlo simulations showed cost effectiveness (annual cost/QALYs &lt; or = 50,000 dollars) in the teleophthalmology strategy based on an assumed inmate population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Teleophthalmology is the better strategy if the number of diabetic inmates in the prison community is &gt;500 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our cost-effectiveness analysis demonstrates that teleophthalmology holds great promise to reduce the cost of inmate care and reduce <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo> caused by diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
