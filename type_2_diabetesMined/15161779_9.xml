<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A prospective follow-up study was carried out with 471 type 2 diabetic outpatients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Primary end points were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related, and cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Excess mortality in this cohort was evaluated by calculating standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) in relation to those of the Rio de Janeiro population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Predictors of mortality were assessed by Kaplan-Meier survival curves and by uni- and multivariate Cox survival analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 57 months (range 2-84 months), 121 (25.7%) patients died, 91 (75.2%) from <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related causes and 44 (36.4%) from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for age and sex, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause SMR was 3.36 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.81-4.02) and the cardiovascular SMR was 3.28 (CI 2.44-4.41) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the Cox multivariate analysis, the predictors of mortality were older age, increased 24-h <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo>, preexisting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e>, presence of frequent <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>ventricular premature contractions</z:mp> and prolonged maximum heart rate-corrected QT interval on baseline electrocardiogram, and decreased serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The use of beta-blockers was a protective factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In Kaplan-Meier curves, these variables were capable of distinguishing subgroups of patients with significantly different prognoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Brazilian type 2 diabetic patients had a more than threefold excess mortality than the general population, largely because of increased cardiovascular mortality risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Several clinical, laboratory, and electrocardiographic predictors of mortality were identified that could possibly be modified to decrease the mortality burden of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Brazil </plain></SENT>
