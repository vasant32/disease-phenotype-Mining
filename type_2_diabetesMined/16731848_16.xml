<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine the impact of twin and zygosity status as well as birth size on in vivo measures of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism, we examined 123 young (aged 22-31 years) and 103 elderly (aged 57-66 years) MZ and DZ twins and age-matched singleton control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants were born at term with available birth records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Peripheral and hepatic insulin action and intracellular <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> partitioning was determined by a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp using tritiated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> combined with indirect calorimetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In elderly subjects, zygosity status influenced nonoxidative <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism, while twin status per se was associated with elevated hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production during both steady-state periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Birth weight was associated with nonoxidative <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in a nongenetic manner within twins and with a high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and low <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> oxidation in singletons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In younger subjects, twin status influenced <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> oxidation rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate a complex age- or time-dependent relationship between independent markers of fetal environment and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis in twins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The documented differential programming effects associated with either <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birth weight</z:hpo> and twin or zygosity status <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> represent known defects of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
