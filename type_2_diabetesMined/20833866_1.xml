<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study among middle-aged adults without prior diagnosis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who completed a 2-h 75-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) and A1C measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 933 participants had a mean age of 54.2 years, and 73% were women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 425 (45.5%) subjects had impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo>, 145 (15.5%) had type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (by OGTT), and 83 (8.9%) had A1C ≥ 6.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity of A1C ≥ 6.5% to define <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (by OGTT) was 40.0 and 96.8% and 68.9 and 95.3%, respectively (by fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> only) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, (64.8%) of Filipino and Japanese subjects with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had isolated postchallenge <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIC</z:e> ≥ 6.5% sensitivity and specificity was 19.1 and 92.1%, respectively, to define isolated postchallenge <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> in the total sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A1C ≥ 6.5% had low sensitivity and may delay diagnosis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> without OGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This limitation is exacerbated by isolated postchallenge <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> in Asian Americans </plain></SENT>
