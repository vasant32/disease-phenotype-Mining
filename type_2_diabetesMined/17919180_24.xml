<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The attention of scientists therefore has to focus on improving our understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind these diseases and towards the design of new drug therapy strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pathophysiology of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is undoubtedly complex, oftentimes characterized by varying states of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and impaired beta-cell function; however, the identification of new pathways is constantly improving our understanding of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We and others have recently shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) can play a role in insulin secretion and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, in this review, we will discuss the potential role of miRNAs in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
