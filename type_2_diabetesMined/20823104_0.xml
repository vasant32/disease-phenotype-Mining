<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to determine the role of a downstream signal, soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), in the regulation of NHGU by NO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Studies were performed on 42-h-fasted conscious dogs fitted with vascular catheters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 0 min, somatostatin was given peripherally along with 4× basal insulin and basal glucagon intraportally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> was delivered at a variable rate via a leg vein to double the blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level and hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> load throughout the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>From 90 to 270 min, an intraportal infusion of the sGC inhibitor <z:chebi fb="8" ids="29300">1H-</z:chebi>[1,2,4] oxadiazolo[4,3-a] quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ) was given in -sGC (n = 10) and -sGC/+NO (n = 6), whereas saline was given in saline infusion (SAL) (n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The -sGC/+NO group also received intraportal SIN-1 (NO donor) to elevate hepatic NO from 180 to 270 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the presence of 4× basal insulin, basal glucagon, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> (2× basal ), inhibition of sGC in the liver enhanced NHGU (mg/kg/min; 210-270 min) by ∼55% (2.9 ± 0.2 in SAL vs. 4.6 ± 0.5 in -sGC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further elevating hepatic NO failed to reduce NHGU (4.5 ± 0.7 in -sGC/+NO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Net hepatic carbon retention (i.e., <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthesis; mg <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> equivalents/kg/min) increased to 3.8 ± 0.2 in -sGC and 3.8 ± 0.4 in -sGC/+NO vs. 2.4 ± 0.2 in SAL (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: NO regulates liver <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake through a sGC-dependent pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The latter could be a target for pharmacologic intervention to increase meal-associated hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake in individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
