<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This paper describes the baseline characteristics of the study population, their estimated risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> and the extent to which that risk is potentially modifiable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Stepwise screening strategies were performed using risk questionnaires and routine general practice data plus random blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, HbA(1c) and fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> measurement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> was diagnosed using the 1999 World Health Organization criteria and estimated 10 year <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> risk was calculated using the UK Prospective <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study risk engine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between April 2001 and December 2006, 3,057 people with screen-detected <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were recruited to the study (mean age 59.7 years, 58% men) after a stepwise screening programme involving 76,308 people screened in 334 general practices in three countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their median estimated 10 year risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> was 11% in women (interquartile range 7-16%) and 21% (15-30%) in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were differences in the distribution of risk factors by country, linked to differences in approaches to screening and the extent to which risk factors had already been detected and treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean HbA(1c) at recruitment was 7.0% (SD 1.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the people recruited, 73% had a blood pressure &gt; or =140/90 and of these 58% were not on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cholesterol levels were above 5.0 mmol/l in 70% of participants, 91% of whom were not being treated with <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: People with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> detected by screening and included in the ADDITION study have a raised and potentially modifiable risk of CHD </plain></SENT>
