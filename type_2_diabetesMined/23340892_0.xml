<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between visit-to-visit variability in SBP and change in urinary albumin excretion (UAE) or development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSWe measured SBP in 354 consecutive patients at every visit during 1 year and calculated the coefficient of variation of SBP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a follow-up study to assess change in UAE or development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp>, the mean interval of which was 3.76 ± 0.71 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Then, we evaluated relationships of variability of SBP to diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> using multiple regression analysis and multiple Cox regression model.RESULTSMultiple regression analysis demonstrated that coefficient of variation of SBP was independently associated with change in UAE (β = 0.1758; P = 0.0108) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adjusted Cox regression analyses demonstrated that coefficient of variation of SBP was associated with an increased hazard of development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp>; hazard ratio was 1.143 (95% confidence interval 1.008-1.302).CONCLUSIONSVisit-to-visit variability in SBP could be a novel risk factor for the development and progression of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
