<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Recent studies have demonstrated that the treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> reduces in-stent restenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to elucidate the mechanism of the efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> for preventing in-stent restenosis in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective, randomized trial involving 54 type 2 diabetic patients referred for coronary stenting who were randomly assigned to either the control or the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Quantitative coronary angiography was performed at study entry and at 6 months follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (eNOS), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha, interleukin-6, leptin, and adiponectin were measured at study entry and at 6 months follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 28 patients were randomly assigned to the control group, and 26 patients were assigned to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in glycemic control levels or in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels in the two groups at baseline or at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Insulin, homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, eNOS, and leptin at follow-up were significantly reduced in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> group compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The late <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> loss and in-stent restenosis were significantly less in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> group than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Leptin independently correlated with late <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> loss at multiple regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> in type 2 diabetic patients significantly reduced leptin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This decreased leptin improved <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and endothelial function with the reduction of insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The improved endothelial function affected the reduction of in-stent restenosis </plain></SENT>
