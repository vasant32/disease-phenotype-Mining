<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> are at increased risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> later in life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to investigate whether, like type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> has a genetic predisposition by studying five common polymorphisms in four candidate genes that have previously been associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 1,777 unrelated Scandinavian women (588 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> and 1,189 pregnant non-diabetic controls) for polymorphisms in the genes encoding <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> inwardly rectifying channel subfamily J, member 11 (KCNJ11 E23K), insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1 G972R), uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2 -866G--&gt;A) and calpain 10 (CAPN10 SNP43 and SNP44) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The EE, EK and KK genotype frequencies of the KCNJ11 E23K polymorphism differed significantly between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> and control women (31.5, 52.7 and 15.8% vs 37.3, 48.8 and 13.9%, respectively; p=0.050) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the frequency of the K allele was increased in women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> (odds ratio [OR]=1.17, 95% CI 1.02-1.35; p=0.027), and this effect was greater under a dominant model (KK/EK vs EE) (OR=1.3, 95% CI 1.05-1.60; p=0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the IRS1 G972R polymorphism showed that RR homozygosity was found exclusively in women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> (91.0, 8.3 and 0.7% vs 90.7, 9.3 and 0.0% for GG, GR and RR genotypes, respectively; p=0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The genotype and allele frequencies of the other polymorphisms studied were not statistically different between the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> and control women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The E23K polymorphism of KCNJ11 seems to predispose to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> in Scandinavian women </plain></SENT>
