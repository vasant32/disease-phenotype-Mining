<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Effects of GLP-1 on secretory mechanisms in type 2 diabetic patients and subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) known to have impaired pulsatile release of insulin have not yet been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight type 2 diabetic patients (64+/-9 years, BMI 28.9+/-7.2 kg/m2, HbA1c 7.7+/-1.3%) and eight subjects with IGT (63+/-10 years, BMI 31.7+/-6.4 kg/m2, HbA1c 5.7+/-0.4) were studied on separate occasions in the fasting state during the continued administration of exogenous GLP-1 (1.2 pmol x kg(-1) x min(-1), started at 10:00 P.M. the evening before) or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For comparison, eight healthy volunteers (62+/-7 years, BMI 27.7+/-4.8 kg/m2, HbA1c 5.4+/-0.5) were studied only with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood was sampled continuously over 60 min (roller-pump) in 1-min fractions for the measurement of plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pulsatile insulin secretion was characterized by deconvolution, autocorrelation, and spectral analysis and by estimating the degree of randomness (approximate entropy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In type 2 diabetic patients, exogenous GLP-1 at approximately 90 pmol/l improved plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations (6.4+/-2.1 mmol/l vs. placebo 9.8+/-4.1 mmol/l, P = 0.0005) and significantly increased mean insulin burst mass (by 68%, P = 0.007) and amplitude (by 59%, P = 0.006; deconvolution analysis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In IGT subjects, burst mass was increased by 45% (P = 0.019) and amplitude by 38% (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By deconvolution analysis, insulin secretory burst frequency was not affected by GLP-1 in either type 2 diabetic patients (P = 0.15) or IGT subjects (P = 0.76) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, by both autocorrelation and spectral analysis, GLP-1 prolonged the period (lag time) between subsequent maxima of insulin concentrations significantly from approximately 9 to approximately 13 min in both type 2 diabetic patients and IGT subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Under placebo conditions, parameters of pulsatile insulin secretion were similar in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, type 2 diabetic patients, and IGT subjects based on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> methodological approaches (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, intravenous GLP-1 reduces plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in type 2 diabetic patients and improves the oscillatory secretion pattern by amplifying insulin secretory burst mass, whereas the oscillatory period determined by autocorrelation and spectral analysis is significantly prolonged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This was not the case for the interpulse interval determined by deconvolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Together, these results suggest a normalization of the pulsatile pattern of insulin secretion by GLP-1, which supports the future therapeutic use of GLP-1-derived agents </plain></SENT>
