<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study assessed the efficacy and safety of liraglutide after 12 weeks of treatment in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial with an open-label comparator arm was conducted among 193 outpatients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 56.6 years and the mean HbA(1c) was 7.6% across the treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomly assigned to one of five fixed-dosage groups of liraglutide (0.045, 0.225, 0.45, 0.60, or 0.75 mg), placebo, or open-label <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi>, 1-4 mg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was HbA(1c) after 12 weeks; secondary end points were fasting serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, fasting C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, fasting glucagon, fasting insulin, beta-cell function, body weight, adverse events, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001988'>hypoglycemic episodes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 190 patients were included in the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HbA(1c) decreased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but the lowest liraglutide dosage group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the 0.75-mg liraglutide group, HbA(1c) decreased by 0.75 percentage points (P &lt; 0.0001) and fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> decreased by 1.8 mmol/l (P = 0.0003) compared with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Improvement in glycemic control was evident after 1 week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Body weight decreased by 1.2 kg in the 0.45-mg liraglutide group (P = 0.0184) compared with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The proinsulin-to-insulin ratio decreased in the 0.75-mg liraglutide group (-0.18; P = 0.0244) compared with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> had decreased HbA(1c) and fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, but slightly <z:hpo ids='HP_0004324'>increased body weight</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No safety issues were raised for liraglutide; observed adverse events were mild and transient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A once-daily dose of liraglutide provides efficacious glycemic control and is not associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Adverse events with the drug are mild and transient, and the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> is negligible </plain></SENT>
