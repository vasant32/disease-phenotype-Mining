<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine whether insulin-induced stimulation of splanchnic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake (SGU) is also impaired, we simultaneously measured leg <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake (LGU) and SGU in 14 nondiabetic subjects and 16 subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> using a combined organ catheterization-tracer infusion technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> was clamped at approximately 9.3 mmol/l, while insulin concentrations were maintained at approximately 72 pmol/l (low) and approximately 150 pmol/l (high) for 3 h each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Endogenous hormone secretion was inhibited with somatostatin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Total body <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disappearance was lower (P &lt; 0.01) and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production higher (P &lt; 0.01) during both insulin infusions in the diabetic compared with the nondiabetic subjects, indicating <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Splanchnic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production was higher (P &lt; 0.05) in the diabetic subjects during the low but not the high insulin infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SGU was slightly lower in the diabetic than in the nondiabetic subjects during the low insulin infusion and 50-60% lower (P &lt; 0.05) during the high insulin infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LGU (P &lt; 0.001), but not SGU, was inversely correlated with the degree of visceral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The contribution of the indirect pathway to hepatic <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthesis did not differ in the diabetic and nondiabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, both flux through the <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> pool (P &lt; 0.05) and the contribution of the direct pathway to <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthesis (P &lt; 0.01) were lower in the diabetic than in the nondiabetic subjects, indicating decreased uptake and/or phosphorylation of extracellular <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, glycogenolysis was equally suppressed in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In summary, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> impairs the ability of insulin to stimulate both MGU and SGU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The defect appears to reside at a proximal (e.g., glucokinase) metabolic step and is not related to the degree of visceral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that impaired hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake as well as MGU contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
