<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The relationship between parity and risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is controversial, and little information is available regarding associations between parity and measures of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and beta-cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to investigate the association between parity and risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> and related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disorders</z:e> using data from a population-based study in a Native Canadian community </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Female participants (n = 383, aged 12-79 years) provided fasting blood samples for the determination of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, and proinsulin concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 75-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test was administered, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> were diagnosed according to World Health Organization criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Waist circumference and percent body fat were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Information regarding occurrence of live births and previously diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was obtained from interviewer-administered questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Parity was associated with a significantly reduced risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (nulliparous vs. &gt;or=1 birth, odds ratio 0.43, 95% CI 0.19- 0.94, P &lt; 0.05) after adjustment for age and waist circumference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, nondiabetic nulliparous women had significantly elevated concentrations of fasting insulin and proinsulin relative to nondiabetic parous women (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) in analyses adjusted for age and waist circumference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results are consistent with those from other populations experiencing high rates of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and suggest the presence of a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-prone phenotype within the nulliparous subcohort of this population, which may contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000789'>infertility</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
