<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The presence of family support, using variables identified in earlier ethnographic research, was assessed via surveys in a convenience sample of 163 diabetic individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> outcome measures (HbA(1c), serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure measures) were extracted from participants' medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bivariate analyses and multiple logistic regressions were conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> measures of family support showed a relation with one or more indicators of metabolic control in bivariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analyses, respondents were more likely to be in the best tertile for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.05), cholesterol (P &lt; 0.05), and HbA(1c) (P &lt; 0.05) if another person cooked most of the meals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Respondents in families who bought/cooked "light" foods were more likely to be in the best tertile for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.005) and cholesterol levels (P &lt; 0.005), and those in families whose members ate "light" foods with them were more likely to be in the best tertile for <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three support variables were entered into a multivariate model, only the variable "other family members cook the majority of the meals" was significantly associated with being in the lowest <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> (P = 0.05), HbA(1c) (P &lt; 0.05), or cholesterol tertiles (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These relationships were most evident for women with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Active family nutritional support, as measured by culturally relevant categories, is significantly associated with control of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>, cholesterol, and HbA(1c) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The findings suggest that the family is a more useful unit of intervention for Diné individuals than for the individual alone when designing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care strategies </plain></SENT>
