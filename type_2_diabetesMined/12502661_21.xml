<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Subjects in whom youth-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult-onset</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was diagnosed in the longitudinal study of health in the Pima Indians of Arizona were followed for microvascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> was diagnosed in 178 subjects before 20 years of age (youth), in 1,359 subjects at 20-39 years of age (younger adults), and in 971 subjects at 40-59 years of age (older adults) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Incidence rates of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> diagnosed by direct ophthalmoscopy through <z:mp ids='MP_0002546'>dilated pupils</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> (protein-to-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio &gt; or =0.5 g/g) were calculated by age at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over 25 years, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> developed in 35 of the participants with youth-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; this incidence rate was not significantly different from that in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult-onset</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P = 0.77) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Incidence rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, however, were significantly lower for the youth-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> group (P = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adjusted for sex, glycemia, and blood pressure, risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> was lower in patients with youth-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than in those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult-onset</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (hazard rate ratio [HRR] 0.42, 95% CI 0.24-0.74, P = 0.003), but risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> was not different (HRR 1.2, 95% CI 0.77-1.3, P = 0.38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In Pima Indians, the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> as a function of duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is similar in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By contrast, the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> is lower in patients with youth-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
