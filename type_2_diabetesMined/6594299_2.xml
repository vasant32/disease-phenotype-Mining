<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An association was found between disease and BW62, a split antigen of B15, with corrected probability significant at the 5% level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of B13 and BW22 were also increased in diabetic patients but the differences were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although it has been postulated that Melanesian communities have protection against <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, they have a high frequency of BW62, which would imply, from the association found in this study, that susceptibility to Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> has yet to become manifest in them </plain></SENT>
