<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The relative contributions of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta-cell dysfunction</z:hpo> to the pathophysiology of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have been debated extensively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The concept that a feedback loop governs the interaction of the insulin-sensitive tissues and the beta cell as well as the elucidation of the hyperbolic relationship between insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion explains why insulin-resistant subjects exhibit markedly increased insulin responses while those who are insulin-sensitive have low responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Consideration of this hyperbolic relationship has helped identify the critical role of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta-cell dysfunction</z:hpo> in the development of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the demonstration of reduced beta-cell function in high risk subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, assessments in a number of ethnic groups emphasise that beta-cell function is a major determinant of oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance in subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005293'>reduced glucose tolerance</z:mp> and that in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> populations the progression from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> and subsequently to Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is associated with declining insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The genetic and molecular basis for these reductions in insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function are not fully understood but it does seem that body-fat distribution and especially intra-abdominal fat are major determinants of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> while reductions in beta-cell mass contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta-cell dysfunction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on our greater understanding of the relative roles of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta-cell dysfunction</z:hpo> in Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we can anticipate advances in the identification of genes contributing to the development of the disease as well as approaches to the treatment and prevention of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
