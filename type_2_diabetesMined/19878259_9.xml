<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After successful phase 2 studies, liraglutide was assessed in a series of phase 3 trials [(Liraglutide Effect and Action in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> (LEAD)] designed to demonstrate efficacy and safety across the continuum of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> antihyperglycaemic care, both as monotherapy and in combination with commonly used oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs (OADs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The LEAD programme also compared liraglutide with other OADs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As a monotherapy, liraglutide demonstrated significant improvements in glycaemic control in comparison with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When combined with one or two OADs, reductions in <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> were generally greater with liraglutide than with comparators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Throughout the trials, liraglutide was associated with weight reduction; in most instances, the reduction from baseline was significantly greater than that seen with comparators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Improvements in assessments of beta-cell function were consistently shown with liraglutide treatment across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, reductions in systolic blood pressure were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Liraglutide was associated with a low risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> and was generally well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The majority of adverse effects were gastrointestinal, the most frequent of which was <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
