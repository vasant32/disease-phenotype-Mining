<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study enrolled patients with inadequately controlled T2DM who were previously treated with one or two oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetics</z:chebi> or were drug na√ève </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After a 2 to 4-week washout and placebo run-in, 561 patients were randomized (2 : 2 : 2 : 1) to double-blind treatment with linagliptin 5 or 10 mg qd, voglibose 0.2 mg tid or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA1c) with linagliptin vs. placebo after 12 weeks and vs. voglibose after 26 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were well balanced across treatment groups (overall mean HbA1c was 8.01%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The adjusted mean (95% confidence interval) treatment differences at week 12 were -0.87% (-1.04, -0.70; p &lt; 0.0001) and -0.88% (-1.05, -0.71; p &lt; 0.0001) for linagliptin 5 and 10 mg vs. placebo and at week 26 were -0.32% (-0.49, -0.15; p = 0.0003) and -0.39% (-0.56, -0.21; p &lt; 0.0001) for linagliptin 5 and 10 mg vs. voglibose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At week 12, mean HbA1c was 7.58, 7.48 and 8.34% in patients receiving linagliptin 5 mg, linagliptin 10 mg and placebo, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At week 26, mean HbA1c was 7.63% with linagliptin 5 mg, 7.50% with linagliptin 10 mg and 7.91% with voglibose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Drug-related adverse event rates were comparable across treatment groups over 12 weeks (9.4% linagliptin 5 mg, 8.8% linagliptin 10 mg and 10.0% placebo) and 26 weeks (11.3% linagliptin 5 mg, 10.6% linagliptin 10 mg and 18.5% voglibose) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no documented cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Linagliptin showed superior <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering efficacy and comparable safety and tolerability to both placebo and voglibose in Japanese patients with T2DM </plain></SENT>
