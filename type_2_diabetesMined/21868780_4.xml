<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Emerging epidemiological evidence suggests that higher <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> intake may reduce <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to examine the association between <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> intake and risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by conducting a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a PubMed database search through January 2011 to identify prospective cohort studies of <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> intake and risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reference lists of retrieved articles were also reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A random-effects model was used to compute the summary risk estimates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Meta-analysis of 13 prospective cohort studies involving 536,318 participants and 24,516 cases detected a significant inverse association between <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> intake and risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (relative risk [RR] 0.78 [95% CI 0.73-0.84]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This association was not substantially modified by geographic region, follow-up length, sex, or family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significant inverse association was observed in overweight (BMI â‰¥25 kg/m(2)) but not in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-weight individuals (BMI &lt;25 kg/m(2)), although test for interaction was not statistically significant (P(interaction) = 0.13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the dose-response analysis, the summary RR of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for every 100 mg/day increment in <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> intake was 0.86 (95% CI 0.82-0.89) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity analyses restricted to studies with adjustment for cereal fiber intake yielded similar results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Little evidence of publication bias was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis provides further evidence supporting that <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> intake is significantly inversely associated with risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a dose-response manner </plain></SENT>
