<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> is an anti-diabetic drug used for the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and orphan nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP, also known as NR0B2), a transcriptional co-repressor, plays an important role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we demonstrate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>-mediated activation of <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (AMPK) increases SHP protein production and regulates IL-6-induced hepatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We investigated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>-mediated SHP production improved <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> through the regulation of an IL-6-dependent pathway (involving signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 [STAT3] and suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 [SOCS3]) in both Shp knockdown and Shp null mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IL-6-induced STAT3 transactivation and SOCS3 production were significantly repressed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, adenoviral constitutively active AMPK (Ad-CA-AMPK), and adenoviral SHP (Ad-SHP), but not in Shp knockdown, or with the adenoviral dominant negative form of AMPK (Ad-DN-AMPK) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and protein localisation studies showed that SHP inhibits DNA binding of STAT3 on the Socs3 gene promoter via interaction and colocalisation within the nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Upregulation of inflammatory genes and downregulation of hepatic insulin signalling by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> IL-6 treatment were observed in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice but not in Shp null mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> IL-6 exposure caused hepatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, leading to impaired insulin tolerance and elevated gluconeogenesis, and these phenomena were aggravated in Shp null mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our results demonstrate that SHP upregulation by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> may prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hepatic disorders</z:e> by regulating the IL-6-dependent pathway, and that this pathway can help to ameliorate the pathogenesis of cytokine-mediated metabolic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
