<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Serum 25(OH)D was determined using a chemiluminescence immunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity/resistance were measured using the Matsuda insulin sensitivity index for oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests (IS(OGTT)) and homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> HOMA-IR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>beta-Cell function was determined using both the insulinogenic index (IGI) divided by HOMA-IR (IGI/IR) and the insulin secretion sensitivity index-2 (ISSI-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS Linear regression analyses indicated independent associations of 25(OH)D with IS(OGTT) and HOMA-IR (beta = 0.004, P = 0.0003, and beta = -0.003, P = 0.0072, respectively) and with IGI/IR and ISSI-2 (beta = 0.004, P = 0.0286, and beta = 0.003, P = 0.0011, respectively) after adjusting for sociodemographics, physical activity, supplement use, parathyroid hormone, and BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">Vitamin D</z:chebi> may play a role in the pathogenesis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, as 25(OH)D concentration was independently associated with both insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function among individuals at risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
