<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The association to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis is less clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the relationship between HSD11B1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels in adipose tissue and in skeletal muscle and anthropometric and metabolic measurements in humans with and without impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twelve <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects with impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis (MetS+) and 12 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> controls (MetS-) received a Very Low Calorie Diet for 16 weeks and adipose tissue biopsies, blood samples and measurements were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a second cohort, skeletal muscle biopsies, blood samples and measurements were obtained from 18 subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2DM) and 17 subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (NGT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Gene expression was measured by DNA microarray in both studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HSD11B1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were reduced during diet, and anthropometric measurements and metabolic parameters were associated with HSD11B1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels in the MetS- group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, in the MetS+ group these associations were lost or in opposite direction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This difference was also observed in skeletal muscle between T2DM and NGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: HSD11B1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels are associated with metabolic parameters and anthropometric measurements in subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis but not in subjects with impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis </plain></SENT>
