<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, mTOR-raptor complex, also called mammalian target of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> complex 1 (mTORC1), generates an inhibitory feedback loop on insulin receptor substrate proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was suggested that nutrient overload leads to insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 resistance in peripheral insulin-responsive tissues and in the beta-cells through sustained activation of mTORC1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this review, we summarize the literature on the regulation and function of mTOR, its role in the organism's response to nutrients and its potential impact on lifespan, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and the metabolic adaptation to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also propose a hypothesis based on data in the literature as well as data generated in our laboratory, which assigns a central positive role to mTOR in the maintenance of beta-cell function and mass in the diabetic environment </plain></SENT>
