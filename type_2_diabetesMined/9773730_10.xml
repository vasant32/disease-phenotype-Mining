<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The main purpose of this work was to study the possible differences in insulin secretion in a large group of type 2 diabetic patients in relation to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and the presence of secondary failure after treatment with oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: There were 147 nonobese and 215 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> type 2 diabetic subjects, aged 35-80 years, investigated in a cross-sectional descriptive study Subjects were grouped according to whether glycemic control was good (mean blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &lt;8.5 mmol/l) or poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Beta-cell function was assessed by measuring meal-stimulated insulin and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> concentrations, as the mean of the three postprandial increments above the premeal value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Basal C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> concentrations were significantly higher in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> than nonobese patients of both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean of meal-stimulated C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> concentrations was also significantly higher in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> than nonobese patients with good glycemic control, but not in the secondary failure groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In nonobese and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients considered separately, a significant negative correlation between the mean of daily blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and meal-stimulated C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> was observed (r=-0.705 and r=-0.679, respectively, P &lt; 0.001) and the residual beta-cell function was significantly correlated with the known duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and metabolic control, but not with BMI, in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: On average, <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> diabetic subjects showed higher meal-stimulated C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> than nonobese subjects only in well-controlled groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In both <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and nonobese patients, an inverse association between meal-stimulated insulin secretion and duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients, as in nonobese patients, the lower beta-cell function seems likely to be the major pathogenetic factor in the appearance of secondary failure, while being overweight plays only a minor role, thus showing that type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is the same disease in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and nonobese patients </plain></SENT>
