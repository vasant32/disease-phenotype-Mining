<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Given the long-term health consequences and increasing incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, there is great interest to potentially prevent or delay its <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Primary prevention studies have demonstrated that intensive exercise and weight reduction, and to a lesser extent certain <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> agents, can reduce new <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in at-risk individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results from post hoc analyses and secondary end-point outcomes of large randomized controlled trials of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35554">cardiovascular drugs</z:chebi> suggest that these may also have beneficial effects, reducing the incidence of new <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in addition to their proven cardiovascular benefits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multiple meta-analyses confirm that drugs primarily acting on the renin-angiotensin system (<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>) reduce the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the populations studied, perhaps via improved insulin sensitivity and/or effects on pancreatic beta cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, results from the recent <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> REduction Approaches with Medication study specifically failed to show a significant reduction in the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8774">ramipril</z:chebi> in individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001952'>abnormal glucose tolerance</z:hpo> at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There is only limited evidence that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> improve <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, and although beta-blockers tend to have detrimental effects on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, newer agents with vasodilatory properties may confer benefits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With current guidelines, the use of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35554">cardiovascular drugs</z:chebi> modifying the <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> will increase in at-risk individuals, but at present, they cannot be recommended to prevent <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
