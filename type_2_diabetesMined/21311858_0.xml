<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The production of this phosphatase is enhanced in insulin-resistant states, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, where high levels of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6) are found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In these metabolic conditions, insulin action on <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> metabolism in skeletal muscle is greatly impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We addressed the role of PTP1B on <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> metabolism in basal and insulin-resistant conditions promoted by TNF-α </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied the effect of TNF-α in the presence and absence of insulin on <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> content and synthesis, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase (GS) and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> phosphorylase (GP) activities and on <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthesis and degradation signalling pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For this purpose we used immortalised cell lines isolated from skeletal muscle from mice lacking PTP1B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Absence of PTP1B caused activation of GS and GP with a net glycogenolytic effect, reflected in lower amounts of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> and activation of the glycogenolytic signalling pathway, with higher rates of phosphorylation of cyclic <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> monophosphate-dependent kinase (PKA), phosphorylase kinase (PhK) and GP phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, insulin action was strongly enhanced in Ptp1b (also known as Ptpn1)(-/-) cells in terms of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> content, synthesis, GS activation rates and GS Ser641 dephosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment with TNF-α augmented the activity ratios of both GS and GP, and impaired insulin stimulation of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthesis in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> myocytes, whereas Ptp1b (-/-) myocytes restored this inhibitory effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We report a glycogenolytic effect of TNF-α, as demonstrated by greater activation of the degradation signalling cascade PKA/PhK/GP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In our model, this effect is mediated by the activation of PKA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We provide new data about the role of PTP1B in <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> metabolism and confirm the beneficial effect that absence of the phosphatase confers against an insulin-resistant condition </plain></SENT>
