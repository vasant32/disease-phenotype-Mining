<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether assessment of barriers to self-care and strategies to cope with these barriers in older adults with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is superior to usual care with attention control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association guidelines recommend the assessment of age-specific barriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the effect of such strategy on outcomes is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We randomized 100 subjects aged ≥69 years with poorly controlled <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (A1C &gt;8%) in two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A geriatric <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> team assessed barriers and developed strategies to help patients cope with barriers for an intervention group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The control group received equal amounts of attention time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The active intervention was performed for the first 6 months, followed by a "no-contact" period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Outcome measures included A1C, Tinetti test, 6-min walk test (6MWT), self-care frequency, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related distress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS We assessed 100 patients (age 75 ± 5 years, duration 21 ± 13 years, 68% type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 89% on insulin) over 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After the active period, A1C decreased by -0.45% in the intervention group vs. -0.31% in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At 12 months, A1C decreased further in the intervention group by -0.21% vs. 0% in control group (linear mixed-model, P &lt; 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The intervention group showed additional benefits in scores on measures of self-care (Self-Care Inventory-R), gait and balance (Tinetti), and endurance (6MWT) compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp>-related distress improved in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS Only attention between clinic visits lowers <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related distress in older adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, communication with an educator cognizant of patients' barriers improves glycemic control and self-care frequency, maintains functionality, and lowers distress in this population </plain></SENT>
