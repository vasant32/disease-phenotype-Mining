<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Antioxidized <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> (anti-oxLDL) antibodies have recently been suggested to be protective against the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We measured the changes in anti-oxLDL antibody levels in the inverse situation of improvement in carbohydrate metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study was undertaken in 73 morbidly <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals, 21 of whom had type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, before and 7 months after they underwent bariatric surgery and in 11 healthy, nonobese individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Measurements were made of the area under the curve of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (AUC(Glu)) by an intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test and of oxidized <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> (oxLDL) and IgG and IgM anti-oxLDL antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The morbidly <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had significantly higher levels of oxLDL compared with the morbidly <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and the control subjects and significantly lower levels of IgM anti-oxLDL antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An inverse correlation was found between the levels of oxLDL and IgM anti-oxLDL antibodies (r = -0.352, P = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the levels of IgG and IgM anti-oxLDL antibodies rose after surgery, this increase was only significant in the diabetic patients, who experienced an improvement in their metabolic profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Different multiple linear regression models showed that the AUC(Glu) was the main factor explaining the behavior of the levels of oxLDL and anti-oxLDL antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found a close association between carbohydrate metabolism and IgM anti-oxLDL antibodies, which were significantly reduced in the morbidly <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The improvement in carbohydrate metabolism after bariatric surgery led to a significant increase in the levels of IgG and IgM anti-oxLDL antibodies </plain></SENT>
