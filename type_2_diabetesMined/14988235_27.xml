<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Glucokinase (GK) has a major role in the control of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis and is a strong potential target for the pharmacological treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report here the mechanism of action of two novel and potent direct activators of GK: 6-[(3-isobutoxy-5-isopropoxybenzoyl)amino]<z:chebi fb="5" ids="15940">nicotinic acid</z:chebi>(GKA1) and 5-([3-isopropoxy-5-[2-(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37992">3-thienyl</z:chebi>)<z:chebi fb="2" ids="42241">ethoxy</z:chebi>]<z:chebi fb="3" ids="22733">benzoyl</z:chebi>]amino)-1,3,4-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="39467">thiadiazole</z:chebi>-2-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33575">carboxylic acid</z:chebi>(GKA2), which increase the affinity of GK for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> by 4- and 11-fold, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>GKA1 increased the affinity of GK for the competitive inhibitor mannoheptulose but did not affect the affinity for the inhibitors <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15525">palmitoyl-CoA</z:chebi> and the endogenous 68-kDa regulator (GK regulatory protein [GKRP]), which bind to allosteric sites or to N-acetylglucosamine, which binds to the catalytic site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In hepatocytes, GKA1 and GKA2 stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> phosphorylation, glycolysis, and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthesis to a similar extent as sorbitol, a precursor of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28757">fructose</z:chebi> 1-phosphate, which indirectly activates GK through promoting its dissociation from GKRP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Consistent with their effects on isolated GK, these compounds also increased the affinity of hepatocyte metabolism for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>GKA1 and GKA2 caused translocation of GK from the nucleus to the cytoplasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This effect was additive with the effect of sorbitol and is best explained by a "<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-like" effect of the GK activators in translocating GK to the cytoplasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, GK activators are potential antihyperglycemic agents for the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> through the stimulation of hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism by a mechanism independent of GKRP </plain></SENT>
