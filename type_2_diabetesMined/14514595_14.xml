<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We have previously reported differences in the prevalence of beta-cell autoantibodies (AAs) in black and white children with insulin-treated <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, suggesting that the disease pathogenesis may be more <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> among racial groups than previously thought </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To further explore this issue, we compared clinical, biochemical, and autoimmune characteristics at disease diagnosis and follow-up treatment in an expanded number of black and white children with and without the presence of AAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study cohort of 130 black children and adolescents, aged &lt;19 years, diagnosed with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and treated with insulin at time of diagnosis (January 1979 to December 1998) were matched with an equal number of white children by age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, sex, and year of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The black children had a higher prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (43 vs. 11%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000956'>acanthosis nigricans</z:hpo> (21 vs. 1%) than white children and a lower prevalence of AAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with black children who had AAs, those with no AAs were older and had a higher prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000956'>acanthosis nigricans</z:hpo>, and parental <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, one of four of the black children with AAs was <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and/or had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000956'>acanthosis nigricans</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among white children, the absence of AAs was not associated with any differences in terms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000956'>acanthosis nigricans</z:hpo> compared with those with AAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similar to their black counterparts, white children without antibodies were older and had a higher prevalence of parental <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although treatment with an insulin sensitizer was used, insulin therapy was rarely discontinued on follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These pediatric subjects, irrespective of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo>, often showed characteristics associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These characteristics were more frequently displayed in black than in white children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that childhood <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may constitute a spectrum of pathogenic mechanisms that may overlap, including those typically associated with both type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This finding could have therapeutic implications </plain></SENT>
