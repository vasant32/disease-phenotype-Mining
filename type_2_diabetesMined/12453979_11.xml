<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether large arteries are resistant to insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Insulin normally acutely decreases central systolic pressure by decreasing wave reflection in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This effect occurs before any changes in peripheral vascular resistance or heart rate under normoglycemic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We determined whether the ability of insulin to decrease central aortic pressure is altered in uncomplicated type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study subjects consisted of 16 type 2 diabetic patients (age 54 +/- 2 years, BMI 29 +/- 1 kg/m(2)) and 19 matched nondiabetic individuals (51 +/- 2 years, 29 +/- 1 kg/m(2)) studied under normoglycemic-hyperinsulinemic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Central aortic pressure waveforms were synthesized from those recorded in the periphery using applanation tonometry and a validated reverse transfer function to construct the central aortic pressure waveform every 30 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This method allowed determination of aortic augmentation (the pressure difference between the first and second central systolic pressure waves) and the augmentation index (augmentation divided by pulse pressure) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Whole-body insulin sensitivity was 31% lower (P &lt; 0.05) in the type 2 diabetic patients than in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Basally, before the insulin infusion, augmentation averaged 8.9 +/- 1.3 and 11.1 +/- 1.2 mmHg (NS) and the augmentation index averaged 23.1 +/- 2.1 and 27.5 +/- 2.1% (NS) in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects and diabetic patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After 30 min of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo>, augmentation decreased significantly to 6.1 +/- 1.1 mmHg (P &lt; 0.001) in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects but remained unchanged at 9.1 +/- 1.1 mmHg (NS) in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At 30 min, the augmentation index had decreased significantly (30 +/- 7% decrease) to 17.9 +/- 2.6% in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects but remained at 24.4 +/- 2.4% in the diabetic patients (13 +/- 4% decrease, P &lt; 0.05 for change vs. <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Central systolic pressure decreased significantly by 30 min in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects but only after 120 min in the type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were no significant changes in heart rate, pulse pressure, or forearm blood flow during the first 120 min of the insulin infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> involves a delay in the ability of insulin to decrease central aortic pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This defect could predispose these patients to develop systolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
