<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: recent studies indicate that <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is an important risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in older patients, but the cause remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: to determine whether vascular or <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related risk factors predict the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in older subjects with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: 63 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> of mean age 75.3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Subjects were screened for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and informants who knew the subjects answered the Informant Questionnaire for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>Cognitive Decline</z:hpo> in the Elderly (IQCODE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Probable <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was diagnosed using highly specific criteria based on the combination of both tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Potential risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> obtained at the time of the cognitive test and annually from a median of 3.2 years previously were examined using univariate methods and simple general linear modelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: since there was a significant association between MMSE and English speaking ability, ten non-Anglo-Celt patients were excluded from the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Probable <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was diagnosed in six of the remaining 53 subjects (11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> was significantly and independently associated with higher diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure measurements over the 3 years before assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure declined over this time in the patients with probable <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and was similar to that in non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> subjects at the time of cognitive assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: these preliminary data suggest that the high rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> found in older people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may be explained by the high rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in this population </plain></SENT>
