<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 160 type 2 diabetic patients were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> (4 mg/day) for 12 weeks in addition to their previous medications, which were unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the PLIN locus were genotyped: PLIN 6209T&gt;C, PLIN 11482G&gt;A, PLIN 13041A&gt;G, and PLIN 14995A&gt;T </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and HbA(1c) levels decreased; mean body weight increased significantly after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the four SNPs tested, only the PLIN 11482G&gt;A polymorphism was associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, there was a significant difference in the increase in the body weight among the genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with the 11482A/A genotype showed less increase in body weight than those with other genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that genetic variations in the perilipin gene can affect <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> associated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> treatment in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
