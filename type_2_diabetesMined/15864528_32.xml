<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adiponectin is an abundant plasma adipokine that plays a physiological role in modulating <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism and exerts a potent anti-inflammatory activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesised that adiponectin levels decrease in response to <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and that this may promote the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression of adiponectin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in adipose tissue was assessed by Northern blotting, and in 3T3-L1 adipocytes exposed to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi> by real-time PCR </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Plasma concentrations of adiponectin and adipose tissue levels of adiponectin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were decreased in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">AngII</z:chebi>-infused rats, and this effect was prevented by cotreatment with tempol or <z:chebi fb="5" ids="30157">BH4 </z:chebi></plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Cotreatment of rats with tempol or <z:chebi fb="5" ids="30157">BH4</z:chebi> reversed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">AngII</z:chebi>-induced increases in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13392">NAD(P)H</z:chebi> oxidase subunit <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Since <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> were observed to prevent the actions of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">AngII</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi> on its own suppressed adiponectin expression, we conclude that adiponectin gene expression is negatively modulated by <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Plasma adiponectin levels may provide a useful indicator of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in vivo, and suppressed levels may contribute to the proinflammatory and metabolic derangements associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
