<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesised that gene expression would be discordantly regulated when comparing the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our secondary aim was to determine the effect of Interleukin-6 (IL6) infusion on circulating adipokines and on gene expression in human adipose tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To do this we used real-time RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Both diabetic and control subjects underwent basal skeletal muscle and subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A subset of these individuals underwent a 3-h infusion of recombinant human IL6 and had adipose tissue samples taken before and after infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> gene expression of suppressor of cytokine signalling (SOCS) 3, peroxisome proliferative activated receptor (PPAR) alpha/delta, PPAR gamma, coactivator 1, alpha (PPARGC1A), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi> palmitoyltransferase 1B and solute carrier family 2 (facilitated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transporter), member 4 (formerly known as <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transporter 4/GLUT4), was higher in adipose tissue, but lower in skeletal muscle of diabetic patients than in that of control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) gene was detected in the adipose tissue of some of the diabetic patients, but not in the control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The following genes were increased by infusion of recombinant human IL6 in both groups: SOCS1/3, resistin, adiponectin, <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase-alpha-1 and PPARA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha, adiponectin and resistin were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> unaffected by IL6 infusion, but plasma resistin was lower in the diabetic subjects than in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The observation that PPARGC1A and the PPARs were upregulated in the adipose tissue of type 2 diabetic patients, along with the finding that adipose tissue from some patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> can express UCP1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, suggests that in these patients white adipose tissue may move towards a brown <z:mp ids='MP_0005375'>adipose tissue phenotype</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
