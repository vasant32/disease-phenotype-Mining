<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to extend this investigation to an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> receptor blocker (ARB) administered orally in normotensive, asymptomatic type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients without <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fourteen type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each patient had myocardial perfusion measured by PET at three occasions: at baseline, following 3 weeks of treatment with 50mg/d and following another 3 weeks of treatment with 100mg/d of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Baseline myocardial perfusion was similar at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three sessions (0.89+/-0.05, 0.90+/-0.08 and 0.84+/-0.05mL/(ming) tissue, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Likewise, maximal hyperaemic perfusion after i.v. <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4653">dipyridamole</z:chebi> (0.56mg/kg bwt) was low but similar at the three sessions (2.01+/-0.14, 2.05+/-0.17 and 1.90+/-0.20mL/(ming) tissue, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Myocardial perfusion reserve, i.e. maximal hyperaemic flow relative to baseline flow, was also low, but similar before and after treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> (2.36+/-0.24, 2.44+/-0.24 and 2.62+/-0.42mL/(ming) tissue, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Oral treatment with an ARB did not normalize coronary vasomotor function in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
