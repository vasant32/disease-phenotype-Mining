<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Eight type 2 diabetic patients ingested 350 ml beef soup 30 min before a potato meal; 55 g whey was added to either the soup (whey preload) or potato (whey in meal) or no whey was given </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Gastric emptying was slowest after the whey preload (P &lt; 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incremental area under the blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> curve was less after the whey preload and whey in meal than after no whey (P &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent insulinotropic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi>, insulin, and cholecystokinin concentrations were higher on both whey days than after no whey, whereas glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> 1 was greatest after the whey preload (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Whey protein consumed before a carbohydrate meal can stimulate insulin and incretin hormone secretion and slow gastric emptying, leading to marked reduction in postprandial glycemia in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
