<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>Weight gain</z:mp> is often perceived as inevitable with insulin therapy, particularly as we strive for tight glycaemic control and are using increasingly proactive insulin titration regimes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The United Kingdom Prospective <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study documented that <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> occurs most rapidly soon after insulin therapy is first initiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The timing of this side effect is particularly undesirable, as <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> may interfere with patients' adjustment to insulin therapy and may undermine appropriate <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-management behaviours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Until recently, many patients had little alternative other than to accept unwanted <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> if they were to achieve sufficient glycaemic control to reduce risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> complications of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Insulin detemir is a novel basal insulin analogue that has consistently been shown in randomized, controlled trials to have a weight-sparing effect (i.e. <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0001262'>reduced weight</z:mp> gain compared with other insulins) in both type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Indeed, unlike neutral protamine Hagedorn (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e>) insulin, the weight-sparing effect of insulin detemir appears to be most prominent in people who are the most <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms behind the weight-sparing effect of insulin detemir are still being clarified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reduced risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> with insulin detemir, coupled with a more consistent and reliable delivery of the desired dose than is available with traditional basal insulin, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e>, has been proposed to minimize defensive snacking by patients, and help to limit <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, even if this was proven, it would be unlikely to fully explain the weight-sparing effect of insulin detemir </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two additional theories have been put forward </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One suggests that due to its novel method of prolonging action via acylation and albumin binding, insulin detemir may differentially influence hepatocytes more than peripheral tissues, thus effectively suppressing hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> output without promoting lipogenesis in the periphery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The second theory suggests that insulin detemir may be more effective than human insulin in communicating satiety signals within the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further clarification of these hypotheses is required </plain></SENT>
