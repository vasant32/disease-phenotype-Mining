<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis was performed using the 2007 California Health Interview Survey with adults in California </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic models were used to examine the associations between the multiple risk and outcome factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the participants, 6.9% of adults had diagnoses of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SPD was present in 7.0% of adults with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> but only in 3.5% of adults without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that participants with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were significantly more likely than those without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> to experience SPD (OR=1.81; 95% CI=[1.3-2.5], p=0.0002), adjusting for other factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, participants with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and SPD were more likely to report insufficient physical activity and more current cigarette smoking than participants without SPD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SPD among participants with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, however, did not significantly affect good <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that adults with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are more likely to experience SPD than adults without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further research is needed to explore the underlying mechanisms for this association among adults with both <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and SPD </plain></SENT>
