<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A questionnaire-based survey was carried out in 1000 (502 male) people with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> to establish whether there is an excess of maternal transmission and familial aggregation in a Sri Lankan population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> was 47+/-12 (+/-S.D.) years and duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 9+/-7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-seven percent reported parents with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 46.9% had no parents with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 16.1% did not know the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> status of at least one parent and there was no <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the probands, 59.4% had at least one affected relative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When both parents' <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> status was known and only one was affected, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was more common among mothers (n = 156) than fathers (n = 125) of probands (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A further 54 probands had both parents with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> and duration of the disease among probands with parental <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 43.1+/-(11.1) and 9.6+/-(6.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the previous generation, 21.2% of maternal grandmothers and 17.3% of maternal grandfathers in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>maternal diabetes</z:hpo> group and 4.8% of maternal grandmothers and 17% of maternal grandfathers in the paternal <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> group had <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> in siblings and children was more common in those with mothers who had <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (53.8% and 4.5%) when compared with those in whom fathers had <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (42.4% and 1.6%) (P &lt; 0.0001 and P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Familial aggregation and excess maternal transmission were observed in people with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Sri Lanka </plain></SENT>
