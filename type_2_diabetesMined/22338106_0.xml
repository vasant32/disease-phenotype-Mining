<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the association between male puberty and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277562" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adult disease</z:e> remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To clarify the link between puberty and adult health, we evaluated the relationship between pubertal timing and risk factors for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> in both males and females from a large, prospective, and randomly ascertained birth cohort from Northern Finland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Pubertal timing was estimated based on pubertal height growth in 5,058 subjects (2,417 males and 2,641 females), and the relationship between puberty and body weight, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> homeostasis, and blood pressure at age 31 years was evaluated with linear regression modeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Earlier pubertal timing associated with higher adult BMI, fasting insulin, diastolic blood pressure, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003233'>decreased HDL cholesterol</z:hpo> in both sexes (P &lt; 0.002) and with higher total serum cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> in males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The association with BMI and diastolic blood pressure remained statistically significant in both sexes, as did the association with insulin levels and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> concentrations in males after adjusting for covariates reflecting both fetal and childhood growth including childhood BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate independent association between earlier pubertal timing and adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e>-related derangements both in males and females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The connection emphasizes that the mechanisms advancing puberty may also contribute to adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
