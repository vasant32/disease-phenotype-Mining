<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mutations of the glucokinase gene have been implicated in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> in pedigrees with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004904'>maturity-onset diabetes of the young</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the contribution of the glucokinase gene to the aetiology of common Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> is uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have studied the role of the glucokinase gene in the pathogenesis of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in South Indians, using both population-association and linkage methodology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A pair of CA-repeat sequences (GCK(3') and GCK(5')) straddling the glucokinase gene were employed as markers, each subject being typed using the polymerase chain reaction and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparisons of allele frequencies at these markers were made between 168 Type 2 diabetic subjects and 70 racially-matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No differences in allele frequencies were apparent at the GCK(5') marker; however, there were significant differences in allele frequencies at the GCK(3') marker between the Type 2 diabetic subjects and control subjects (chi 2 = 11.6, df = 3, p = 0.009) with an increase of the z allele (78.0% vs 66.4%) and a decrease of the z + 2 allele (13.7% vs 25.0%) amongst the diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Linkage between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> and the glucokinase gene was studied in 53 nuclear pedigrees under a variety of genetic models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Linkage was excluded (lod score &lt; -2) at a recombination fraction of zero under five of the ten models used and highly unlikely (-2 &lt; lod score &lt; -1) under the others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The combination of positive association and negative linkage suggests that glucokinase acts as a minor gene influencing the development of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> within this population </plain></SENT>
