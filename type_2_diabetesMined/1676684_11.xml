<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is associated with the deposition of islet amyloid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The major formative <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi>, has recently been characterised and an abnormality of the structure or expression of this gene is a possible candidate for the inherited component of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A restriction fragment length polymorphism of the gene has been identified with Pvu II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To study the relationship between the islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> gene and Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, two distinct genetic approaches have been undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Firstly, non-linkage has been demonstrated in four pedigrees, with four normoglycaemic first degree relatives having an allele associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in other family members, and one affected relative not having the putatively associated allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The LOD score taking age-related penetrance into account was -1.68, making linkage unlikely (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Secondly, in a population-based restriction fragment length polymorphism survey, no linkage disequilibrium of the alleles was found between a population of unrelated Caucasian subjects with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A mutation in or near the islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> gene is thus unlikely to be a common cause of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
