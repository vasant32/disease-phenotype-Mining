<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is unclear whether this defect is primary or acquired secondary to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We determined the <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase (GS) activity; the content of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-6-phosphate, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi>; and the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transport in satellite cell cultures established from diabetic and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Myotubes were precultured in increasing insulin concentrations for 4 days and subsequently stimulated acutely by insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The present study shows that the basal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake as well as insulin-stimulated GS activity is reduced in satellite cell cultures established from patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, increasing insulin concentrations could compensate for the reduced GS activity to a certain extent, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> supraphysiological insulin concentrations induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in GS and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transport activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> comprises at least two important defects under physiological insulin concentrations: a reduced <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transport under basal conditions and a reduced GS activity under <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin stimulation, implicating a reduced <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake in the fasting state and a diminished insulin-mediated storage of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> as <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> after a meal </plain></SENT>
