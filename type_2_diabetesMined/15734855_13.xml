<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Women with isolated IR (low visceral AT and high IR) were characterized by significantly higher fasting and 2-h glycemia and higher fibrinogen, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> (apo)B concentrations than women with low visceral AT and low IR (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> profile and inflammatory markers were not significantly different between women with high visceral AT and low IR and women with low visceral AT and low IR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Women with high visceral AT and high IR had higher fasting and 2-h glycemia, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>-apoB levels; lower apoAI and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>(2) cholesterol levels; as well as higher C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 concentrations than women with low visceral AT and low IR (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, 15 of the 35 women (42.9%) in the high visceral AT and high IR group were newly diagnosed with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, whereas no women were diagnosed with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the group of women with low visceral AT and low IR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results show that although the presence of high IR in its isolated form is associated with some metabolic alterations, it is the combination of both high visceral AT and high IR that is the most detrimental for the metabolic health in postmenopausal women </plain></SENT>
