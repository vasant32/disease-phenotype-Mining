<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to determine whether IAF accumulation predicts the future development of MetS in non-diabetic Japanese-Americans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of 457 Japanese-American men and women (mean+/-SD: age 51.5 +/- 12.0 years, BMI 23.9 +/- 3.1 kg/m(2)) without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or MetS at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these, 408 completed a 5-year follow-up and 366 completed a 10-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BMI, waist circumference, IAF and subcutaneous fat (SCF) areas by computed tomography, blood pressure, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, triacylglycerol and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> were measured at baseline and at 5- and 10-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MetS was defined using National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Incidence of MetS was 15.3% at 5 years and 17.8% at 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A change of 1 SD in IAF area was associated with a 2.1-fold increase in the odds of MetS at 10 years (odds ratio = 2.08, 95% CI 1.41-3.07) after adjusting for age, sex, baseline IAF and the presence of each individual MetS criteria at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This association was independent of changes in fasting insulin and SCF areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We conclude that IAF accumulation over time independently predicts the development of MetS and thus may play an important role in the development of MetS in Japanese-Americans </plain></SENT>
