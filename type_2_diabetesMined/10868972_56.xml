<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Soluble forms of VCAM (sVCAM-1) may serve as monitors of increased expression of membrane-bound VCAM-1 and thus may reflect progressive formation of <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Levels of sVCAM-1 have been found to be increased among type 2 diabetic as compared with nondiabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To study the association of plasma sVCAM-1 concentration and risk of cardiovascular and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality among nondiabetic and diabetic subjects, we investigated an age-, sex-, and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-tolerance-stratified sample (n = 631) of a population-based cohort aged 50-75 years that was followed prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma levels of sVCAM-1 were determined in frozen -70 degrees C baseline samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 7.4 years (mean) of follow-up, 107 (17%) subjects had died (42 of cardiovascular causes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the entire group, increased sVCAM-1 levels were significantly associated with increased risk of cardiovascular mortality (relative risks [RRs] per 100 ng/ml sVCAM-1 increase, 1.10 [1.05-1.15] after adjustment for age, sex, and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance status) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This RR was somewhat diminished by further adjustment for the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>; levels of total, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi>; the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> (a putative marker of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e>); levels of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor (a marker of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e>) and C-reactive protein (a marker of low-grade <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>); and estimates of glomerular filtration rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the RR remained statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The RR among type 2 diabetic subjects was 1.13 (1.07-1.20) per 100 ng/ml sVCAM-1 increase after adjustment for age and sex, which was somewhat higher but not significantly different from the RR in nondiabetic subjects (P value for interaction term, 0.12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further adjustment for other risk factors gave similar results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, levels of sVCAM-1 are independently associated with the risk of cardiovascular mortality in type 2 diabetic subjects and therefore might be useful for identifying subjects at increased cardiovascular risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Increased plasma sVCAM-1 levels may reflect progressive formation of <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp>, or sVCAM-1 itself may have bioactive properties related to cardiovascular risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our data, however, argue against the hypotheses of sVCAM-1 levels simply being a marker of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e>, of low-grade <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, or of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>impaired renal function</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
