<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 117 subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and coexistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> between 40 and 70 years of age and with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> concentrations &lt; 150 micromol/l were recruited from two inner-city general <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> clinics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects underwent MRA of the renal arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a subgroup of 85 subjects, data concerning possible clinical and biochemical predictors of <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> were collected, and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3380">captopril</z:chebi> test was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For comparison of a continuous variable between subjects with a positive MRA and those with a negative MRA, the Mann-Whitney test was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For comparison of a discrete variable between subjects with a positive MRA and those with a negative MRA, Fisher's exact test was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> detected by using MRA in 117 hypertensive type 2 diabetic subjects was 17%; 19 subjects had unilateral <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>, and only 1 subject had bilateral <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A femoral bruit was significantly more common in subjects with a positive MRA versus subjects with a negative MRA (21 vs. 0%; Fisher's exact test P &lt; 0.005); however, other clinical features of atherosclerotic disease were not statistically associated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Greater duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> were features of subjects with <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3380">captopril</z:chebi> test was negative in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects, although the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> response to oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3380">captopril</z:chebi> was significantly greater in subjects with <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> detected by MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> is common in hypertensive type 2 diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The presence of a femoral bruit is a useful predictive clinical marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3380">captopril</z:chebi> test is not useful in predicting the hemodynamic significance of <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> in this patient group </plain></SENT>
