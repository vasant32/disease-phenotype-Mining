<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to determine whether there is a causal relation between intramuscular TG accumulation and insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in mice with muscle-specific overexpression of human <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> lipase (LPL) and control mice, muscle TG content was measured in combination with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake in vivo, under hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of LPL in muscle resulted in accumulation of TGs in skeletal muscle (85.5 +/- 33.3 vs. 25.7 +/- 23.1 micromol/g tissue in LPL and control mice, respectively; P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the hyperinsulinemic clamp study, there were no differences in plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, and FFA concentrations between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, whole-body, as well as skeletal muscle, insulin-mediated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake did not differ between LPL-overexpressing and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, whole-body <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> oxidation was decreased by approximately 60% (P &lt; 0.05), whereas nonoxidative <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal was increased by approximately 50% (P &lt; 0.05) in LPL-overexpressing versus control mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, overexpression of human LPL in muscle increases intramuscular TG accumulation, but does not affect whole-body or muscle-specific insulin-mediated uptake, findings that argue against a simple causal relation between intramuscular TG content and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
