<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> has been suggested to be detrimental to beta-cell function, causing reduced <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion and disproportionately elevated proinsulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the effect on several beta-cell functions of prolonged in vitro exposure of human pancreatic islet cultures to high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Islets exposed to high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels (33 mmol/l) for 4 and 9 days showed dramatic decreases in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced insulin release and in islet insulin content, with increased proportion of proinsulin-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> relative to insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> in insulin stores correlated with the reduction in insulin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels and human insulin promoter transcriptional activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also demonstrated that high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> dramatically lowered the binding activity of pancreatic duodenal homeobox 1 (the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-sensitive transcription factor), whereas the transcription factor rat insulin promoter element 3b1 activator was less influenced and insulin enhancer factor 1 remained unaffected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most of these beta-cell impairments were partially reversible when islets first incubated for 6 days in high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> were transferred to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (5.5 mmol/l) concentrations for 3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that cultured human islets are sensitive to the deleterious effect of high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations at multiple functional levels, and that such mechanisms may play an important role in the decreased insulin production and secretion of type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
