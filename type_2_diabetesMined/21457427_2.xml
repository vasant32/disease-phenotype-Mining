<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a retrospective analysis using a large US electronic medical record database, eligible patients included those with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and an HbA(1c) of ≥7.0% or at least two fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels of ≥126 mg/dl while on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy for at least 6 months within the period of 1 January 1997 to 31 December 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Time to treatment intensification was calculated as the time between index date (date on which HbA(1c) ≥ 7% after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy for at least 6 months) and first prescription for additional antihyperglycaemic agent during follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were required to have data for at least 12 months prior to and following the index date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A Cox proportional hazards model was employed to determine patient baseline characteristics associated with time to treatment intensification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 12 566 patients identified, mean age at index date was 63 years and 51% were female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean index HbA(1c) was 8.0% overall, with 66, 19 and 15% of patients having an index HbA(1c) of 7 to &lt;8%, 8 to &lt;9% and ≥9%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median time to treatment intensification was 14.0 months overall and 19.0, 8.7 and 4.5 months for patients with index HbA(1c) of 7 to &lt;8%, 8 to &lt;9% and ≥9%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Factors associated with treatment intensification included higher index HbA(1c) , younger age, higher Charlson co-morbidity index, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> daily dose ≥ 1500 mg and later index date (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In US clinical practice, median time to receive additional antihyperglycaemic medication is more than 1 year for patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who failed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy </plain></SENT>
