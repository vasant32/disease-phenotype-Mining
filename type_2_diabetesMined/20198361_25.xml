<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate the relationship between microRNA expression and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we compared global microRNA expression in insulin target tissues from three inbred rat strains that differ in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using microarrays, we measured the expression of 283 microRNAs in adipose, liver and muscle tissue from hyperglycaemic (Goto-Kakizaki), intermediate glycaemic (Wistar Kyoto) and normoglycaemic (Brown Norway) rats (n = 5 for each strain) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression was compared across strains and validated using quantitative RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, microRNA expression variation in adipose tissue was investigated in 3T3-L1 adipocytes exposed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0851834" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemic conditions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found 29 significantly differentiated microRNAs (p(adjusted) &lt; 0.05): nine in adipose tissue, 18 in liver and two in muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these, five microRNAs had expression patterns that correlated with the strain-specific glycaemic phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MiR-222 (p(adjusted) = 0.0005) and miR-27a (p(adjusted) = 0.006) were upregulated in adipose tissue; miR-195 (p(adjusted) = 0.006) and miR-103 (p(adjusted) = 0.04) were upregulated in liver; and miR-10b (p(adjusted) = 0.004) was downregulated in muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Exposure of 3T3-L1 adipocytes to increased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration upregulated the expression of miR-222 (p = 0.008), miR-27a (p = 0.02) and the previously reported miR-29a (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Predicted target genes of these differentially expressed microRNAs are involved in pathways relevant to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The expression patterns of miR-222, miR-27a, miR-195, miR-103 and miR-10b varied with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e>, suggesting a role for these microRNAs in the pathophysiology of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, as modelled by the Gyoto-Kakizaki rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We observed similar patterns of expression of miR-222, miR-27a and miR-29a in adipocytes as a response to <z:mp ids='MP_0005559'>increased glucose levels</z:mp>, which supports our hypothesis that altered expression of microRNAs accompanies primary events related to the pathogenesis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
