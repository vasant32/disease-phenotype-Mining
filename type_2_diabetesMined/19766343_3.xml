<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) is a growing worldwide problem with WHO estimates suggesting that 300 million people will be affected by 2025 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>T2DM could result in both microvascular and macrovascular complications but the presentation of these complications could vary globally and be influenced by diabetic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the prevalence of these complications by surveying 787 patients of south-Asian origin in diabetic clinics in the UK (n=351), Mauritius (n=173) and India (n=263) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found the prevalence of microvascular complications such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (India 16.3%; Mauritius 2.3%; UK 2.6%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> (India 20.5%; Mauritius 10.5%; UK 2.3%) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> (India 8.4%; Mauritius 1.2%; UK 5.1%) complications to be significantly higher in India compared to Mauritius and the UK (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, macrovascular complications such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> were significantly more prevalent in Mauritius and the UK compared to India (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The use of diabetic medication such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi>, Sulphonylureas and Insulin was significantly higher in the UK and Mauritius compared to India (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean HbA1c was significantly higher in India compared to the UK (India 8.68%; UK 8.30%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that microvascular complications are higher in India due to poorer diabetic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings could be explained by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> presentation of diabetic patients in India due to the lack of primary care initiatives to screen and monitor treatment of T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the poor diabetic control in India could reflect a dearth of clinical, evidence-based-knowledge regarding diabetic medication amongst Indian physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In view of the global increase in T2DM, this is a major concern for Indian healthcare </plain></SENT>
