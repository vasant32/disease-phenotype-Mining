<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study was performed on 27 patients with Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and 42 with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with complications were excluded from the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>36 non-diabetic volunteers, non-smokers who do not consume alcoholic beverage, were chosen from the medical staff as control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MGMT activity was measured by the transfer of radiolabeled methyl groups from a prepared methylguanine-DNA substrate to the enzyme fraction of leukocyte extract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Leukocyte MGMT activity was significantly reduced in both Type 1 and Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients as compared with control subjects (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The present study demonstrates decreased MGMT activity in leukocytes from patients with Type 1 and Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
