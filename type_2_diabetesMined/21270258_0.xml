<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to examine the role of the α isoform of PI4P5K in glucohomeostasis and insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The response of PI4P5Kα(-/-) mice to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> challenge and a type 2-like <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-inducing high-fat diet was examined in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated responses and PI4P5Kα(-/-) pancreatic islets and β-cells were characterized in culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We show that PI4P5Kα(-/-) mice exhibit increased first-phase insulin release and improved <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> clearance, and resist high-fat diet-induced development of type 2-like <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PI4P5Kα(-/-) pancreatic islets cultured in vitro exhibited decreased numbers of insulin granules docked at the plasma membrane and released less insulin under quiescent conditions, but then secreted similar amounts of insulin on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Stimulation-dependent PIP(2) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> occurred on the plasma membrane of the PI4P5Kα(-/-) pancreatic β-cells, accompanied by a near-total loss of cortical F-actin, which was already decreased in the PI4P5Kα(-/-) β-cells under resting conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that PI4P5Kα plays a complex role in restricting insulin release from pancreatic β-cells through helping to maintain plasma membrane PIP(2) levels and integrity of the actin cytoskeleton under both basal and stimulatory conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The increased first-phase <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated release of insulin observed on the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> diet may underlie the partial protection against the elevated serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> seen in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-like model systems </plain></SENT>
