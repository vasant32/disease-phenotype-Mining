<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In Europids who are diagnosed with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> before the age of 50 years, the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the offspring of the diabetic mothers is greatly increased compared with the risk in those born to diabetic fathers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesised that offspring born to mothers with young-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> would have been exposed to mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> in utero, so we studied the impact of this on their beta cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We measured beta cell function using early insulin response (EIR) after oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> using HOMA; and HbA(1c) in 568 non-diabetic adult offspring born to parents with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (mean age 55.8 years), split according to which parent was affected (in 327 it was the mother) and parental age of diagnosis: &lt;50 years (n=117) or &gt; or =50 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To reduce the impact of genetic susceptibility, the offspring of affected fathers were used as control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Offspring of mothers with young-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had lower EIR (log EIR 4.32, 95% CI [4.14-4.51] vs 4.63 [4.43-4.83] p=0.02) and higher HbA(1c) (4.89% [4.79-4.99] vs 4.68% [4.57-4.79] p=0.02) than the offspring of fathers with young-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity was similar in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in EIR or HbA(1c) between the offspring born to mothers and fathers who were diagnosed after the age of 50 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We conclude that the offspring of mothers with young-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have a reduction in beta cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This is consistent with exposure to mild maternal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> programming beta cell function </plain></SENT>
