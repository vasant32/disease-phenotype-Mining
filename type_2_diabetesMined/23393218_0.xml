<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While changes in GIP levels did not correlate with insulin, glucagon, and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, the increase in GLP-1 secretion was inversely related to the postsurgery decrease in insulin secretion (R(2) = 0.56; P = 0.012) but not to the <z:mp ids='MP_0002710'>increased glucagon secretion</z:mp>, which correlated inversely with the reduction of insulin (R(2) = 0.46; P = 0.03) and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (R(2) = 0.37; P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Given that the remaining pancreas presumably has preserved intraislet <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp>, insulin secretory capacity, and α- and β-cell interplay, our data suggest that the <z:mp ids='MP_0002710'>increased glucagon secretion</z:mp> is related to decreased systemic insulin.CONCLUSIONSPylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy was associated with a decrease in GIP and a remarkable increase in GLP-1 levels, which was not translated into <z:mp ids='MP_0003058'>increased insulin secretion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rather, the <z:mp ids='MP_0002727'>hypoinsulinemia</z:mp> may have caused an increase in glucagon secretion </plain></SENT>
