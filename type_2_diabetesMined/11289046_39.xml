<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During fasting, FFAs increased from 636 to 711 micromol/l in type 2 diabetic patients and from 462 to 573 micromol/l in control subjects (P &lt; 0.04), but GNG did not change in diabetic patients (6.9 vs. 6.5 micromol x kg(-1) x min(-1), P &gt; 0.05) or in control subjects (5.1 vs. 5.4 micromol x kg(-1) x min(-1), P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During fasting plus NA, FFAs decreased in diabetic patients and control subjects (from 593 to 193 and from 460 to 162 micromol/l, respectively); GNG decreased (from 6.1 to 4.2 and from 4.7 to 3.5 micromol x kg(-1) x min(-1)), whereas GL decreased in diabetic patients (from 5.3 to 4.4 micromol x kg(-1) x min(-1)) but increased in control subjects (from 5.4 to 7.2 micromol x kg(-1) min(-1)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the FFA rebound, FFAs increased in diabetic patients and control subjects (from 193 to 1,239 and from 162 to 1,491 micromol/l, respectively); GNG increased (from 4.2 to 5.4 and from 3.4 to 5.3 micromol x kg(-1) x min(-1) respectively), and GL decreased (from 4.4 to 3.4 and from 7.3 to 4.3 micromol x kg(-1) x min(-1), respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In summary, during an extended overnight fast, increasing plasma FFA levels stimulated GNG, whereas decreasing FFA levels inhibited GNG in both diabetic and control subjects; 20 h after the last meal, approximately one-third of GNG in both diabetic and control subjects was dependent on FFAs; and autoregulation of EGP by GL in response to decreasing GNG was impaired in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
