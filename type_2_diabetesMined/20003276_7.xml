<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHOD: Twenty inactive subjects (mean age 53.5 years) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Baseline HbA1c, blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, heart rate, and blood pressure were measured for each subject prior to the initiation of the exercise program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, subjects were matched to age, waist circumference and sex and assigned to either isocaloric resistance or treadmill exercise groups, which met 3 times per week for 10 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both groups showed a reduction in pre and post-exercise blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and HbA1c values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no change in resting blood pressure or heart rate in either group during the course of the 10 week intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The group receiving resistance exercises showed significant differences in the daily pre-exercise plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> readings between the beginning and end of the exercise protocol (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were significant improvements in the mean HbA1c reading pre and post training in both groups (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the greater reduction was noted in the resistance exercise group, and at 10 weeks their HbA1c levels were significantly lower than the group that received treadmill exercises (p &lt; 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Ten weeks of resistance exercises were associated with a significantly better glycemic control in adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared to treadmill exercise </plain></SENT>
