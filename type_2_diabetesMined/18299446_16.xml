<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Health literacy (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>), the capacity of individuals to access, understand, and use health information to make informed and appropriate health-related decisions, has been recognized as an important concept in patient education and disease management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examined the psychometric properties of newly developed scales for measuring three different levels of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> (i.e., functional, communicative, and critical) in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The reliability and validity of the three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> scales were evaluated in a sample of 138 outpatients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, knowledge of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, information-seeking behaviors, and self-efficacy were assessed for each patient through a self-report questionnaire and review of electronic medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Scale items were constructed to directly reflect the definition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Internal consistency of functional, communicative, and critical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> scales was adequately high (alpha = 0.84, alpha = 0.77, and alpha = 0.65, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three interpretable factors were identified in exploratory factor analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Correlations between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> scales and other measures supported the construct validity of the scales </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> scales were only moderately correlated with each other, suggesting that each represents a different domain of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> abilities and skills </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our newly developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> scales are reliable and valid measures of three types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Exploring a patient's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> levels may provide a better understanding of the patient's potential barriers to self-management of disease and health-promoting behaviors </plain></SENT>
