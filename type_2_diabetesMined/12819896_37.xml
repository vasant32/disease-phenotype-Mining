<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, most prevalence-studies are uncontrolled and could also be inaccurate from selection-bias, as they are conducted in specialized treatment settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the prevalence and risk factors of co-morbid <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in a community-based sample of older adults, comparing Type 2 diabetic patients with healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A large (n=3107) community-based study in Dutch adults (55-85 years of age) was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pervasive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> was defined as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e>-D score greater than 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was obtained from self-reports and data from general practitioners </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A number of 216 patients (7%) were identified as having Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of pervasive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> was increased in people with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and co-morbid <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disease (20%) but not in patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> only (8%), compared with the healthy control subjects (9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Regression analyses in diabetic patients yielded that being single, being female, having functional limitations, receiving instrumental support and having an external locus of control were associated with higher levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The Results suggest that the prevalence of pervasive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> is increased in patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and co-morbid disease(s), but not in patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Functional limitations that often accompany co-morbid <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disease could play an essential role in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings can enable clinicians and researchers to identify high-risk groups and set up prevention and treatment programs </plain></SENT>
