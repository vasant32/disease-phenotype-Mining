<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Recent data suggested that <z:chebi fb="25" ids="50112">sex hormone</z:chebi>-binding globulin (SHBG) levels decrease when fat accumulates in the liver and that circulating SHBG may be causally involved in the pathogenesis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated mechanisms by which high SHBG may prevent development to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Before and during a 9-month lifestyle intervention, total body and visceral fat were precisely measured by magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) tomography and liver fat was measured by (1)H-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> spectroscopy in 225 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity was estimated from a 75-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (IS(OGTT)) and measured by a euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp (IS(clamp), n = 172) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Insulin secretion was measured during the OGTT and an ivGTT (n = 172) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SHBG levels correlated positively with insulin sensitivity (IS(OGTT), P = 0.037; IS(clamp), P = 0.057), independently of age, sex, and total body fat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate model, these relationships were also significant after additional adjustment for levels of the adipokine adiponectin and the hepatokine fetuin-A (IS(OGTT), P = 0.0096; IS(clamp), P = 0.029) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adjustment of circulating SHBG for liver fat abolished the relationships of SHBG with insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, circulating SHBG correlated negatively with fasting glycemia, before (r = -0.17, P = 0.009) and after (r = -0.14, P = 0.04) adjustment for liver fat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No correlation of circulating SHBG with adjusted insulin secretion was observed (OGTT, P = 0.16; ivGTT, P = 0.35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The SNP rs1799941 in SHBG was associated with circulating SHBG (P â‰¤ 0.025) but not with metabolic characteristics (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &gt; 0.18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Possible mechanisms by which high circulating SHBG prevents the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> involve regulation of fasting glycemia but not alteration of insulin secretory function </plain></SENT>
