<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma2 (PPARG2) Pro12Ala polymorphism has been associated with a higher BMI and a lower risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The association between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> and PPARG variants can be influenced by environmental factors such as early growth, dietary fat, and (as recently shown) breast-feeding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objectives of this study were to assess 1) the influence of the PPARG2 Pro12Ala polymorphism on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> markers in adolescents and 2) a possible modulating effect of breast-feeding on these associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data on breast-feeding duration, BMI, and genotypes for the Pro12Ala polymorphism were available for 945 adolescents (mean age 14.7 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The breast-feeding duration was obtained from parental records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We measured weight, height, waist circumference, and six skinfold thicknesses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No significant associations between the Pro12Ala polymorphism and any of the above-mentioned anthropometric parameters were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were significant interactions between the PPARG2 Pro12Ala polymorphism and breast-feeding with regard to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> measurements (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> adjusted P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Indeed, in children who had not been breast-fed, Ala12 allele carriers had higher <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> parameters (e.g., Delta BMI +1.88 kg/m(2), adjusted for age, sex, and center, P = 0.007) than Pro12Pro adolescents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in breast-fed subjects, there was no significant difference between Ala12 allele carriers and Pro12Pro children in terms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> measurements, whatever the duration of breast-feeding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Breast-feeding appears to counter the deleterious effect of the PPARG2 Pro12Ala polymorphism on anthropometric parameters in adolescents </plain></SENT>
