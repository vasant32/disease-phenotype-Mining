<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The association between changes in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> concentrations over time and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed whether two <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> determinations obtained 5 years apart can predict incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">Triglyceride</z:chebi> levels at baseline (time 1) and 5 years later (time 2), followed by subsequent follow-up of 5.5 years, were measured in 13,953 apparently healthy men (age 26-45 years) with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> &lt;300 mg/dl (&lt;3.39 mmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During 76,742 person-years, 322 cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A multivariate model adjusted for age, BMI, total cholesterol-to-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> ratio, family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, blood pressure, physical activity, and smoking status revealed a continuous independent rise in incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with increasing time 1 triglyceride levels (P(trend) &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Men in the lowest tertile of time 1 triglyceride levels who progressed to the highest tertile over follow-up (low-high) exhibited a hazard ratio (HR) of 12.62 (95% CI 3.52-31.34) compared with those remaining in the lowest tertile at both time points (reference group: low-low) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Whereas men who were at the top <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> level tertile throughout follow-up (high-high) had a HR for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> of 7.08 (2.52-14.45), those whose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> level decreased to the lowest tertile (high-low) exhibited a HR of 1.97 (0.67-6.13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Alterations in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels during follow-up were associated with changes in BMI, physical activity, and eating breakfast habit (P &lt; 0.05), but remained an independent modifier of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk even after adjustment for such changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Two measurements of fasting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels obtained 5 years apart can assist in identifying apparently healthy young men at increased risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, independent of traditional risk factors and of associated changes in BMI and lifestyle parameters </plain></SENT>
