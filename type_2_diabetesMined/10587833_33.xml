<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study sample comprised healthy women (aged 30-65 years) in Sweden who were representative of the general population in a metropolitan area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Socioeconomic position was measured by educational level (mandatory [&lt; or = 9 years], high school, or college/university) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> was defined as the presence of two or more of the following components: 1) fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level &gt; or = 7.0 mmol/l; 2) arterial blood pressure &gt; or = 160/90 mmHg; 3) fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> &gt; or = 1.7 mmol/l and/or <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> &lt; 1.0 mmol/l; and 4) central <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (waist-to-hip ratio &gt; 0.85 and/or BMI &gt; 30 kg/m2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After adjustment for age, the risk ratio for the presence of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> comparing the lowest (&lt; or = 9 years) with the highest (college/university) education was 2.7 (95% CI 1.1-6.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This association persisted after controlling for menopausal status, family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and behavioral risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Low education is associated with increased risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> in middle-aged women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings show that not only are women with low socioeconomic position at increased risk for individual risk factors that are associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, they are also at increased risk for the metabolic clustering of risk factors </plain></SENT>
