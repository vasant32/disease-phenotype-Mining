<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A major unanswered question concerns the potential ability of DPP-4 inhibition to have beneficial disease-modifying effects, specifically to attenuate loss of pancreatic beta-cell mass and function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigated the effects of a potent and selective DPP-4 inhibitor, an analog of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> (des-fluoro-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi>), on glycemic control and pancreatic beta-cell mass and function in a mouse model with defects in insulin sensitivity and secretion, namely high-fat diet (HFD) <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> (STZ)-induced diabetic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Significant and dose-dependent correction of postprandial and fasting <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, HbA(1c), and plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> and free fatty acid levels were observed in HFD/STZ mice following 2-3 months of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment with des-fluoro-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> dose dependently increased the number of insulin-positive beta-cells in islets, leading to the normalization of beta-cell mass and beta-cell-to-alpha-cell ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, treatment of mice with des-fluoro-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi>, but not glipizide, significantly increased islet insulin content and improved <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion in isolated islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that DPP-4 inhibitors may offer long-lasting efficacy in the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by modifying the courses of the disease </plain></SENT>
