<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, the shorter, class I alleles are associated with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, whereas the longer, class III alleles are associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000147'>polycystic ovary</z:hpo> syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCOS</z:e>), and size at birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Parent-of-origin effects have been reported for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCOS</z:e>, thus implicating a role for <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> in these phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In mice, Ins2 is imprinted and paternally expressed in the yolk sac </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In humans, evidence for the imprinting of INS is circumstantial, with occasional monoallelic expression in the thymus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we found evidence for the imprinted paternal expression of INS in the human yolk sac </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two other imprinted genes from the same cluster are also expressed monoallelically in the human yolk sac </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IGF2 was expressed solely from the paternal allele, and H19 was expressed solely from the maternal allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest not only further functional roles for the human yolk sac in early fetal growth, but also evidence for a potential causal link between the control of insulin expression during development and insulin/growth-related diseases in later life </plain></SENT>
