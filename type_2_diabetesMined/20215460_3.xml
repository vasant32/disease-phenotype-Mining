<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the relationship between long-term trends in fitness and the incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A cohort of 4,187 Japanese men free of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> completed annual health checkups and fitness tests for estimated maximal oxygen uptake at least four times over 7 years (1979-1985) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We modeled the trend in fitness over 7 years for each man using simple linear regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Men were then divided into quartiles based on the regression coefficient (slope) from the model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up period (1985-1999), 274 men developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were obtained using the Cox proportional hazards model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Men in the lowest quartile of the distribution decreased in fitness over the 7 years (median slope -1.25 ml/kg/min), whereas men in the highest quartile increased in fitness (median slope 1.33 ml/kg/min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With adjustment for age, initial fitness level, BMI, systolic blood pressure, cigarette smoking, alcohol intake, and a family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and use of the lowest quartile, the HRs (95% CI) for the second through fourth quartiles were 0.64 (0.46-0.89), 0.40 (0.27-0.58), and 0.33 (0.21-0.50), respectively (P(trend) &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the long-term trend in fitness is a strong predictor of the incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Japanese men </plain></SENT>
