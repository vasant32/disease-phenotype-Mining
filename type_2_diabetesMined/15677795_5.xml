<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the hypothesis that bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD) will be lower in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) versus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (NGT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Total body BMC and BMD of 184 overweight Latino children (106 boys, 78 girls, 11.9 +/- 1.7 years) with a family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> tolerance was assessed by 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> after an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Area under the insulin curve (AUC) assessed the cumulative insulin response to oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> insulin response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (AIR) was determined by an intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Partial correlations revealed an inverse relationship between BMC and AIR (r = -0.29, P = 0.00), AUC (r = -0.28, P = 0.00), fasting insulin (r = -0.16, P = 0.04), and 2-h insulin (r = -0.16, P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in BMC or BMD between children with IGT (n = 46) or NGT (n = 138) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Stepwise multiple linear regression revealed that 89% of the variance in BMC is attributed to lean mass (87%), age (1%), and AIR (1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>BMD was explained by lean mass (69%), Tanner stage (3%), and AUC (2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest that in overweight children, lean mass is the primary predictor of BMC and BMD, whereas age, Tanner stage, and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and cumulative insulin responses to oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> make subtle independent contributions to the total variances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, poor glycemic control does not seem to be detrimental to bone mass of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pre-diabetic</z:e> children </plain></SENT>
