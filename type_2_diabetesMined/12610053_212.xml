<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The discrepancies between the data published previously might be caused by the interference of several factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To test the effect of overall glycemic control itself, we analyzed the diurnal glycemic profiles of type 2 diabetic patients investigated at different levels of HbA(1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In 290 non-insulin- and non-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi>-using patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (PG) concentrations were determined at fasting (8:00 A.M.) and during postprandial and postabsorptive periods (at 11:00 A.M., 2:00 P.M., and 5:00 P.M.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The areas under the curve above fasting PG concentrations (AUC(1)) and &gt;6.1 mmol/l (AUC(2)) were calculated for further evaluation of the relative contributions of postprandial (AUC(1)/AUC(2), %) and fasting [(AUC(2) - AUC(1))/AUC(2), %] PG increments to the overall diurnal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The data were compared over quintiles of HbA(1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The relative contribution of postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> decreased progressively from the lowest (69.7%) to the highest quintile of HbA(1c) (30.5%, P &lt; 0.001), whereas the relative contribution of fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> increased gradually with increasing levels of HbA(1c): 30.3% in the lowest vs. 69.5% in the highest quintile (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The relative contribution of postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excursions is predominant in fairly controlled patients, whereas the contribution of fasting <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> increases gradually with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> worsening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results could therefore provide a unifying explanation for the discrepancies as observed in previous studies </plain></SENT>
