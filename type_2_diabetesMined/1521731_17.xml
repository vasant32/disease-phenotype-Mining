<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have recently examined the exons encoding the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase domain and GLUT 4 in 30 subjects with Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> using a molecular scanning approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The variant sequences Val-Met985 and Lys-Glu1068 of the insulin receptor and Val-Ile383 of GLUT 4 were each separately found in three different diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a study of a Welsh population, the GLUT 4(383) variant was found in three of 160 diabetic and none of the 80 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, the same group of Welsh Type 2 diabetic and control subjects was analysed using allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridisation, single nucleotide primer extension and allele-specific restriction digestion to ascertain the frequency of the two insulin receptor mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Val-Met985 mutation was found in none of the 160 Welsh Caucasian Type 2 diabetic subjects and two of 80 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Lys-Glu1068 mutation removes a Sty 1 site and digestion of amplified exon 18 with Sty 1 confirmed the presence of the mutation in the heterozygous state in the original subject </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of the Welsh diabetic or control subjects had the Glu1068 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The discovery of a very common silent polymorphism at codon 130 of GLUT 4 allowed examination of the association of this locus with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> using allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridisation in a subset of the Welsh subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
