<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The association between quantity of fruit and vegetable (F&amp;V) intake and risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2D) is not clear, and the relationship with variety of intake is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The current study examined the association of both quantity and variety of F&amp;V intake and risk of T2D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We examined the 11-year incidence of T2D in relation to quantity and variety of fruit, vegetables, and combined F&amp;V intake in a case-cohort study of 3,704 participants (n = 653 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> cases) nested within the European Prospective Investigation into <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> and Nutrition-Norfolk study, who completed 7-day prospective food diaries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Variety of intake was derived from the total number of different items consumed in a 1-week period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariable, Prentice-weighted Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A greater quantity of combined F&amp;V intake was associated with 21% lower hazard of T2D (HR 0.79 [95% CI 0.62-1.00]) comparing extreme tertiles, in adjusted analyses including variety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Separately, quantity of vegetable intake (0.76 [0.60-0.97]), but not fruit, was inversely associated with T2D in adjusted analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Greater variety in fruit (0.70 [0.53-0.91]), vegetable (0.77 [0.61-0.98]), and combined F&amp;V (0.61 [0.48-0.78]) intake was associated with a lower hazard of T2D, independent of known confounders and quantity of intake comparing extreme tertiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that a diet characterized by a greater quantity of vegetables and a greater variety of both F&amp;V intake is associated with a reduced risk of T2D </plain></SENT>
