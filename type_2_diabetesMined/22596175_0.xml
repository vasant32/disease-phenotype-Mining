<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Elevated plasma interleukin-18 (IL-18) has been linked to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM) and its complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, so far this association has been shown only in predominantly white populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined IL-18 levels and their association with incident DM in a racially <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a nested case-cohort design representing a 9-year follow-up of 9,740 middle-aged, initially healthy, nondiabetic white and African American participants of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Risk in Communities Study, we selected and measured analytes on race-stratified (50% white, 50% African American) random samples of both cases of incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 548) and eligible members of the full cohort (n = 536) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS Baseline IL-18 levels were significantly higher in white participants compared with African American participants (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although white participants in the fourth (versus first) quartile of IL-18 levels had a significant hazard ratio (HR) for developing DM (HR: 2.1, 95% CI: 1.3-3.4), after adjustment for age, sex, and study center, no difference was seen among African Americans (HR: 1.0, 95% CI: 0.6-1.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Unlike those in African Americans, IL-18 levels in whites had a significant correlation with age (P &lt; 0.01); anthropometric characteristics such as waist circumference (P &lt; 0.001), height (P = 0.04), waist-to-hip ratio (P &lt; 0.001), and BMI (P &lt; 0.01); and total (P &lt; 0.001) and high-molecular-weight (P &lt; 0.001) adiponectin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There are racial differences in levels of IL-18 and the association of IL-18 with risk factors and incident type 2 DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, there seems to be a complex interplay of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> in the development of DM </plain></SENT>
