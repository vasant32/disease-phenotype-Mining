<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Serum EC-SOD concentrations were determined in 222 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 75 healthy control subjects by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects had the EC-SOD domain genotyped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The serum EC-SOD concentrations showed a distinct bimodal distribution in both patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects with the high-level phenotype carried the Arg213Gly mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequency of this variant was similar in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Within the group of subjects with the common EC-SOD phenotype, the serum EC-SOD concentration (mean +/- SE) was significantly higher in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (99.3 +/- 1.3 ng/ml) compared with the control subjects (68.4 +/- 2.3 ng/ml, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Stepwise multiple regression analysis of the data from the diabetic common phenotype group showed a significant relationship between serum EC-SOD concentration and duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (F = 5.31), carotid artery intimal-media thickness (F = 8.24), and severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> (F = 16.05) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (F = 4.43) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We observed a strong relationship between the serum concentration of EC-SOD and the severity of both micro- and macrovascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that serum EC-SOD concentration levels may be a marker of vascular injury, possibly reflecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>-induced oxidative injury to the vascular endothelium and decreased binding of EC-SOD to the vascular wall </plain></SENT>
