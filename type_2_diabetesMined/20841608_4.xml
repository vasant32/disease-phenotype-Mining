<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the current study was to determine whether double-stranded adeno-associated virus (dsAAV)-mediated in vivo expression of β-cell growth factors, glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) and the NK1 fragment of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF/NK1) in β-cells, improves pathology in the db/db mouse model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS; The glucoregulatory actions of GLP-1 and full-length HGF are well characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we test the ability of HGF/NK1 to induce proliferation of exogenous islets and MIN6 β-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, we target both GLP-1 and HGF/NK1 to endogenous β-cells using dsAAV vectors containing the mouse insulin-II promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We compare the abilities of these gene products to induce islet proliferation in vitro and in vivo and characterize their abilities to regulate <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after AAV-mediated delivery to endogenous islets of db/db mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Recombinant HGF/NK1 induces proliferation of isolated islets, and dsAAV-mediated expression of both GLP-1 and HGF/NK1 induces significant β-cell proliferation in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, both GLP-1 and HGF/NK1 expressed from dsAAV vectors enhance β-cell mass and insulin secretion in vivo and significantly delay the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> in db/db mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A single treatment with dsAAV vectors expressing GLP-1 or HGF/NK1 enhances islet growth and significantly improves pathology in a mouse model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This represents the first example of a successful use of HGF/NK1 for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> therapy, providing support for direct AAV-mediated in vivo delivery of β-cell growth factors as a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
