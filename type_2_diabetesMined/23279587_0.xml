<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We recruited and tested 10 individuals with T2D by collecting a fasting blood sample immediately prior to, a whole-body moderate-high intensity resistance exercise session, and 24, 48 and 72 h afterwards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No changes to estimates of insulin sensitivity (HOMA2), <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> or insulin were observed using a repeated measures analysis of variance (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Further, there were no changes observed to markers of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> at 24 h following the resistance exercise session (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that insulin sensitivity is not acutely modified, positively or negatively, at 24, 48 or 72 h after a bout of resistance exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nor are markers of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> altered during this time frame in a way that could cause transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
