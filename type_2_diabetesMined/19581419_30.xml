<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have reported that beta-cell mitochondria exist as discrete organelles that exhibit <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> bioenergetic capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To date, networking activity, and its role in mediating beta-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and function, remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this article, we investigate beta-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> fusion and fission in detail and report alterations in response to various combinations of nutrients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using matrix-targeted photoactivatable green fluorescent protein, mitochondria were tagged and tracked in beta-cells within intact islets, as isolated cells and as cell lines, revealing frequent fusion and fission events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Manipulations of key <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dynamics proteins OPA1, DRP1, and Fis1 were tested for their role in beta-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The combined effects of free fatty acid and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> on beta-cell survival, function, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> were explored with relation to alterations in fusion and fission capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: beta-Cell mitochondria are constantly involved in fusion and fission activity that underlies the overall <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of the organelle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We find that networking activity among mitochondria is capable of distributing a localized green fluorescent protein signal throughout an isolated beta-cell, a beta-cell within an islet, and an INS1 cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Under noxious conditions, we find that beta-cell mitochondria become fragmented and lose their ability to undergo fusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, manipulations that shift the dynamic balance to favor fusion are able to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> fragmentation, maintain <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dynamics, and prevent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that alterations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> fusion and fission play a critical role in nutrient-induced beta-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and may be involved in the pathophysiology of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
