<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at baseline is a risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We prospectively followed 51,552 Finnish men and women 25-74 years of age without a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>History of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and other study parameters were determined at baseline using standardized measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ascertainment of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> status was based on the nationwide Social Insurance Institution's drug register data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hazard ratios of incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> associated with the history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During a mean follow-up period of 18.0 years, 324 men and 309 women developed incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Age- and study year-adjusted hazard ratios of incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> among subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, compared with those without it, were 1.80 (95% CI 1.03-3.15) in men, 1.93 (1.05-3.53) in women, and 1.85 (1.23-2.80) in men and women combined (adjusted also for sex) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further adjustment for BMI, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, education, leisure-time physical activity, smoking, alcohol drinking, and coffee and tea consumption affected the results only slightly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The multivariate adjusted association between type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> was also confirmed in stratified subgroup analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is associated with an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Surveillance bias might account for higher rates in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mechanism behind this association between <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> is not known </plain></SENT>
