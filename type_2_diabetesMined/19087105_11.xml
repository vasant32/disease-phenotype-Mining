<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: TULIP [Testing the Usefulness of gLargine when Initiated Promptly in type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM)] was a 9-month, 12-visit, open-label, multinational, multicentre, randomized study to evaluate starting glargine or intensifying LM in T2DM patients aged 40-75 years, body mass index (BMI) 24-35 kg/m2 and A1c 7-8%, treated with maximum doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and sulphonylurea for &gt; or = 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Glargine was injected once daily (evening) and titrated to fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> 0.7-1.0 g/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the LM arm, dietary and physical activity counselling recommended stable weight for people with BMI &lt; 27 kg/m2 or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> of 3 kg for patients with BMI &gt; or = 27 kg/m2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 215 patients were randomized to glargine (n = 106) or LM (n = 109) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary objective was patients achieving A1c &lt; 7% at endpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Secondary endpoints included changes in A1c, in fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG), body weight and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two hundred and eleven (52.6% male) patients were randomized and treated; mean (+/- s.d.) age 60.7 +/- 7.9 years, weight 84.5 +/- 13.1 kg, BMI 29.9 +/- 3.5 kg/m2 and A1c 7.6 +/- 0.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>More patients reached A1c &lt; 7% (66 vs. 38%; p &lt; 0.0001) or &lt; 6.5% (34 vs. 11%; p = 0.0001) with glargine vs. LM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The change in FPG from baseline to study endpoint was significantly greater in the glargine vs. the LM arm (-0.50 +/- 0.47 vs. -0.05 +/- 0.39 g/l respectively; p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Compared with the glargine group, the LM group showed a decrease in weight (+0.9 +/- 2.9 vs. -2.5 +/- 3.2 kg; p &lt; 0.0001), as well as the expected lower symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> (55.3 vs. 25.0%; p &lt; 0.0001) and nocturnal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> (20.4 vs. 5.6%; p = 0.0016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No significant changes were observed from baseline to study endpoint in any of the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> parameters tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with T2DM with A1c 7-8%, who were previously treated by conventional LM and OAD therapy, adding glargine resulted in greater improvements in glycaemic control vs. intensifying LM </plain></SENT>
