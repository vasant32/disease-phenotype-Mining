<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the effects of different environments on these diseases in Pima Indians in Mexico and the U.S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Adult Pima-Indian and non-Pima populations in the Sierra Madre mountains of Mexico were examined using oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests and assessments for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, physical activity, and other risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results were compared with those from Pima Indians in Arizona </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both Pima populations were typed for DNA polymorphisms to establish their genetic similarity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The age- and sex-adjusted prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the Mexican Pima Indians (6.9%) was less than one-fifth that in the U.S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pima Indians (38%) and similar to that of non-Pima Mexicans (2.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> was similar in the Mexican Pima Indians (7% in men and 20% in women) and non-Pima Mexicans (9% in men and 27% in women) but was much lower than in the U.S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pima Indians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Levels of physical activity were much higher in both Mexican groups than in the U.S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pima Indians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The two Pima groups share considerable genetic similarity relative to other Native Americans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The much lower prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in the Pima Indians in Mexico than in the U.S. indicates that even in populations genetically prone to these conditions, their development is determined mostly by environmental circumstances, thereby suggesting that type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is largely preventable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This study provides compelling evidence that changes in lifestyle associated with Westernization play a major role in the global epidemic of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
