<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We searched EMBASE and Medline through March 2006 and examined reference lists of retrieved articles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We excluded studies that did not assess physical activity of moderate intensity independent of activities of vigorous intensity (more than six times the resting metabolic rate) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Information on study design, participant characteristics, assessment of physical activity, and outcomes and estimates of associations were extracted independently by two investigators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We calculated summary relative risks (RRs) using a random-effects model for the highest versus the lowest reported duration of activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 10 prospective cohort studies of physical activity of moderate intensity and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, including a total of 301,221 participants and 9,367 incident cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five of these studies specifically investigated the role of walking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The summary RR of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 0.69 (95% CI 0.58-0.83) for regular participation in physical activity of moderate intensity as compared with being sedentary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the RR was 0.70 (0.58-0.84) for regular walking (typically &gt; or = 2.5 h/week brisk walking) as compared with almost no walking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The associations remained significant after adjustment for BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Similar associations were observed in men and women and in the U.S. and Europe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that adherence to recommendations to participate in physical activities of moderate intensity such as brisk walking can substantially reduce the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
