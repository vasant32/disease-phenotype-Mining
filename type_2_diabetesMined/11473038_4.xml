<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> drugs are widely used for the treatment of this disease, their effect on insulin release patterns is not well established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to assess the impact of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> treatment and 5 weeks of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi>) treatment on insulin secretory dynamics in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To this end, 10 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (age 53 +/- 2 years, BMI 27.5 +/- 1.1 kg/m(2), fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> 9.8 +/- 0.8 mmol/l, HbA(1c) 7.5 +/- 0.3%) were studied in a double-blind placebo-controlled prospective crossover design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients received 40-80 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi>/placebo twice daily for 5 weeks with a 6-week washout period intervening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Insulin pulsatility was assessed by 1-min interval blood sampling for 75 min 1) under baseline conditions (baseline), 2) 3 h after the first dose (80 mg) of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>) with the plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration clamped at the baseline value, 3) after 5 weeks of treatment (5 weeks), and 4) after 5 weeks of treatment with the plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration clamped during the sampling at the value of the baseline assessment (5 weeks-elevated) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum insulin concentration time series were analyzed by deconvolution, approximate entropy (ApEn), and spectral and autocorrelation methods to quantitate pulsatility and regularity </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The frequency and regularity of insulin pulses were not modified significantly by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>There was, however, a correlation between individual values for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> improvement of regularity, as measured by ApEn, and the decrease in fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> during short-term (5-week) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi> treatment (r = 0.74, P = 0.014, and r = 0.77, P = 0.009, for fine and coarse ApEn, respectively) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The data suggest a possible relationship between the improvement in short-term glycemic control and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> improvement of regularity of the in vivo insulin release process </plain></SENT>
