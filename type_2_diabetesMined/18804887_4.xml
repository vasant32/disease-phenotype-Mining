<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A randomised controlled trial (RCT) was conducted, testing the system against standard support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using 3 centres, 89 patients participated in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Outcome measures included glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA(1c)), body mass index (BMI) and a variety of quantitative psychological and educational measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Assessment was made at 6 months ("short-term") and 12 months ("long-term") post-intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The educational programme was associated with benefits in HbA(1c) levels (p=0.005), illness attitudes (p=0.04), and perceived treatment effectiveness (p=0.03) at 6 months follow-up compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 12 months however, only illness attitudes (p=0.01), and self-monitoring (p=0.002) showed benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A combined outcome measure showed positive benefit for the educational programme both at 6 months (p=0.001) and 12 months (p=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This structured educational programme, aimed at encouraging self-help, was associated with only limited benefits in glycaemic control, but there were significant educational and psychological benefits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> education should be regarded as having broad patient-based positive outcomes, and should not be expected to have lasting benefits on glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
