<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was investigate this possible relationship using data from the manufacturer's (sanofi-aventis) pharmacovigilance database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analysed the manufacturer's (sanofi-aventis) pharmacovigilance database for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> randomised clinical trials (RCTs; Phase 2-4) comparing insulin glargine with any comparator in type 1 or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> serious adverse events coded under the System Organ Class of '<z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, benign, malignant and unspecified' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment-emergent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> judged to be malignant were included in this analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The database included 31 studies, 12 in type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 19 in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty compared insulin glargine with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin, 29 were parallel-group studies and two had a crossover design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Studies were generally of 6 months' duration, except for trial reference number 4016 (n = 1,017), which had a duration of 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, 10,880 people were included in the analysis (insulin glargine, 5,657; comparator, 5,223) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Forty-five people (0.8%) vs 46 people (0.9%) reported 52 and 48 cases of malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in the insulin glargine and comparator groups, respectively (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.60-1.36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Skin (12 people with 16 events vs six people with seven events, RR 1.85, 95% CI 0.69-4.92), colon and rectum (six vs ten people, RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.20-1.52), breast (four vs six people, RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.17-2.18) and gastrointestinal tract (six vs four people, RR 1.38, 95% CI 0.39-4.90) were the most commonly reported sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In these 31 RCTs, insulin glargine was not associated with an increased incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>, compared with the comparator group </plain></SENT>
