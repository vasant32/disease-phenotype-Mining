<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To use genome-wide fixed marker arrays and improved analytical tools to detect genetic associations with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a carefully phenotyped human sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 1,087 Framingham Heart Study (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FHS</z:e>) family members were genotyped on the Affymetrix 100K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array and examined for association with incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and six <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related quantitative traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Quality control filters yielded 66,543 SNPs for association testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used two complementary SNP selection strategies (a "lowest P value" strategy and a "multiple related trait" strategy) to prioritize 763 SNPs for replication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We genotyped a subset of 150 SNPs in a nonoverlapping sample of 1,465 FHS unrelated subjects and examined <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 763 SNPs for in silico replication in three other 100K and one 500K genome-wide association (GWA) datasets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We replicated associations of 13 SNPs with one or more traits in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FHS</z:e> unrelated sample (16 expected under the null); none of them showed convincing in silico replication in 100K scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seventy-eight SNPs were nominally associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in one other 100K GWA scan, and two (rs2863389 and rs7935082) in more than one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five SNPs showed promising associations with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related traits in 500K GWA data; one of them (rs952635) replicated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FHS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five previously reported associations were confirmed in our initial dataset </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FHS</z:e> 100K GWA resource is useful for follow-up of genetic associations with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related quantitative traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Discovery of new <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> genes will require larger samples and a denser array combined with well-powered replication strategies </plain></SENT>
