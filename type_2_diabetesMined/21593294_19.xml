<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted an observational analysis of participants in the Look AHEAD (Action For Health in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp>) study (n=5,145, 40.5% male, 37% from ethnic/racial minorities) and examined the association between the magnitude of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and changes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk factors at 1 year and the odds of meeting predefined criteria for clinically significant improvements in risk factors in individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The magnitude of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> at 1 year was strongly (P&lt;0.0001) associated with improvements in glycemia, blood pressure, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> but not with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (P=0.79) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared with weight-stable participants, those who lost 5 to &lt;10% ([means±SD] 7.25±2.1 kg) of their body weight had increased odds of achieving a 0.5% point reduction in HbA1c (odds ratio 3.52 [95% CI 2.81-4.40]), a 5-mmHg decrease in diastolic blood pressure (1.48 [1.20-1.82]), a 5-mmHg decrease in systolic blood pressure (1.56 [1.27-1.91]), a 5 mg/dL increase in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (1.69 [1.37-2.07]), and a 40 mg/dL decrease in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (2.20 [1.71-2.83]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The odds of clinically significant improvements in most risk factors were even greater in those who lost 10-15% of their body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Modest weight losses of 5 to &lt;10% were associated with significant improvements in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk factors at 1 year, but larger weight losses had greater benefits </plain></SENT>
