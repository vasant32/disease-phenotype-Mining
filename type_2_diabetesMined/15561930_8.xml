<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Interleukin (IL)-1beta is a proinflammatory cytokine that is involved in type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> development and impairs beta-cell survival and function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because effective insulin signaling is required for the optimal beta-cell function, we assessed the effect of IL-1beta on the insulin pathway in a rat pancreatic beta-cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We show that IL-1beta decreases insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor (IR) and insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins as well as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activation, and that this action is not due to the IL-1beta-dependent nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) production in RINm5F cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We next analyzed if suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)-3, which can be induced by multiple cytokines and which we identified as an insulin action inhibitor, was implicated in the IL-1beta inhibitory effect on insulin signaling in these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We show that IL-1beta increases SOCS-3 expression and induces SOCS-3/IR complex formation in RINm5F cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we find that ectopically expressed SOCS-3 associates with the IR and reduces insulin-dependent IR autophosphorylation and IRS/PI3K pathway in a way comparable to IL-1beta treatment in RINm5F cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We propose that IL-1beta decreases insulin action in beta-cells through the induction of SOCS-3 expression, and that this effect potentially alters insulin-induced beta-cell survival </plain></SENT>
