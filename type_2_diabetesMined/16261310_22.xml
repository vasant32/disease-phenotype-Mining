<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated whether ethnic differences in subclinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, coronary and carotid artery calcified plaque and carotid artery intima-medial thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) were present in members of The <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Heart Study families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In a bi-racial cohort of 1,180 individuals from families enriched for members with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we calculated coronary and carotid artery calcified plaque using fast-gated helical computed tomography, and measured carotid artery <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> and clinical risk factor profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Generalised estimating equations were used to test for an association between measures of subclinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> and ethnicity and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After adjustment for age, ethnicity and kidney function, African-Americans had significantly lower amounts of coronary artery calcified plaque (mean+/-SE) (866+/-158 vs 1,915+/-135, respectively; p=0.0466) and carotid artery calcified plaque (179+/-51 vs 355+/-27, respectively; p=0.0240) relative to whites, despite having increased carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> (0.71+/-0.01 vs 0.67+/-0.004 cm, respectively; p=0.0007), and higher blood pressure, <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> and HbA1c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sex-specific analyses revealed that African-American men had significantly lower coronary and carotid artery calcified atheroma than white men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In women, ethnic differences in calcified carotid artery plaque, but not coronary artery plaque, were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In families enriched for members with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, African-American men had markedly lower levels of coronary and carotid artery calcified plaque than white men, despite increased carotid artery <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> and conventional risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that susceptibility to subclinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> differs markedly according to ethnicity and sex </plain></SENT>
