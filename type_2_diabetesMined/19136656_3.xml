<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> results from a combination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948379" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">impaired insulin secretion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To directly address the effects of hepatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in adult animals, we developed an inducible liver-specific insulin receptor knockout mouse (iLIRKO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using this approach, we were able to induce variable insulin receptor (IR) deficiency in a tissue-specific manner (liver mosaicism) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: iLIRKO mice presented progressive hepatic and extrahepatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001410'>liver dysfunction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Initially, iLIRKO mice displayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> and increased beta-cell mass, the extent of which was proportional to the deletion of hepatic IR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our studies of iLIRKO suggest a cause-and-effect relationship between progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and the fold increase of plasma insulin levels and beta-cell mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ultimately, the beta-cells failed to secrete sufficient insulin, leading to uncontrolled <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We observed that hepatic IGF-1 expression was enhanced in iLIRKO mice, resulting in an increase of circulating IGF-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Concurrently, the IR-A isoform was upregulated in hyperplastic beta-cells of iLIRKO mice and IGF-1-induced proliferation was higher than in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In mouse beta-cell lines, IR-A, but not IR-B, conferred a proliferative capacity in response to insulin or IGF-1, providing a potential explanation for the beta-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> induced by liver <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in iLIRKO mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our studies of iLIRKO mice suggest a liver-pancreas <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> axis in which IGF-1 functions as a liver-derived growth factor to promote compensatory <z:mp ids='MP_0005491'>pancreatic islet hyperplasia</z:mp> through IR-A </plain></SENT>
