<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that at birth, the beta-cell mass of the GK rat is severely reduced compared with that of the Wistar rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, beta-cell deficit could be the primary defect leading to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To identify the abnormality at the origin of the beta-cell mass deficit, we compared the fetal development of GK and Wistar rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our study reveals that during early development (embryonic day 12-14 [E12-14]), GK fetuses present a delayed global growth that progressively recovers: at birth, no size or weight difference persists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, from E18 onward, the weight and DNA content of the pancreas and liver are reduced by 30% in the GK fetuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cell proliferation is reduced in the GK pancreas from E16 to E20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Whereas apoptotic cells are scarce in the Wistar fetal pancreas, a wave of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> from E16 to E18 was detected in the GK pancreas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analysis of pancreas differentiation revealed that from E12 to E14, there are no significant differences in the number of alpha- and beta-cells between the GK and Wistar pancreas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, by E16, the average number of beta-cells in the GK pancreas represents only 50% that of the Wistar pancreas, and this difference persists until birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The number of alpha-cells was reduced by 25% from E18 to E21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>To determine whether the defect in GK pancreas development depends on intrinsic pancreatic factors or on <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> extrapancreatic factors, we performed in vitro cultures of E12 pancreatic rudiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The cultures show that in vitro, the growth and <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> differentiation of the GK and Wistar pancreatic rudiments are identical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Thus, impaired development of the GK pancreas probably results from insufficiency of extrapancreatic factor(s) necessary for the growth and survival of fetal pancreatic cells </plain></SENT>
