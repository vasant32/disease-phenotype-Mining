<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: This study was to test the hypothesis that enhanced <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> is induced in monocytes with over-activated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase during the development of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Levels of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> were analyzed in 73 diabetic patients and 36 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">Superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and protein carbonylation were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase was examined and p47phox translocation was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: With the abnormality of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism, diabetic patients showed a higher <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> state indicated by decreased SOD activity but elevated <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> and protein carbonylation level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Monocytes in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> also showed elevated ROS generation and protein carbonylation level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase was highly activated in monocytes represented by p22phox up-regulation and p47phox translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant positive bivariate correlation was found between <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> level as well as p22phox expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In vitro experiments also indicated that <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> could stimulate ROS generation in a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we carried out same measurement in 40 diabetic patients with anti-diabetic intervention and obtained the reinforced results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>Hyperglycemia</z:hpo> is the main factor which induces <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> mainly by activation of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase in monocytes of diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
