<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We evaluated insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion across the entire range of fasting (FPG) and 2-h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (PG), and we investigated the differences in insulin sensitivity and insulin release in different <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 6,414 Finnish men (aged 57 +/- 7 years, BMI 27.0 +/- 3.9 kg/m2) from our ongoing population-based METSIM (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Metabolic Syndrome</z:e> in Men) study were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these subjects, 2,168 had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, 2,859 isolated impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (IFG), 217 isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT), 701 a combination of IFG and IGT, and 469 newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The Matsuda index of insulin sensitivity decreased substantially within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range of FPG (-17%) and 2-h PG (-37%) and was approximately -65 and -53% in the diabetic range of FPG and 2-h PG, respectively, compared with the reference range (FPG and 2-h PG &lt;5.0 mmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Early-phase insulin release declined by only approximately -5% within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range of FPG and 2-h PG but decreased significantly in the diabetic range of FPG (by 32-70%) and 2-h PG (by 33-51%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Changes in insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion in relation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> were independent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The predominant feature of isolated IGT was impaired peripheral insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Isolated IFG was characterized by impaired early and total insulin release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Peripheral insulin sensitivity was already decreased substantially at low PG levels within the normoglycemic range, whereas impairment in insulin secretion was observed mainly in the diabetic range of FPG and 2-h PG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> did not affect changes in insulin sensitivity or insulin secretion in relation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
