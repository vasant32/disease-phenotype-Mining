<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: After a screening, diet/exercise run-in and drug wash-off period, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> +/- <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> dose titration/stabilization period and a 2-week, single-blind placebo run-in, 441 patients (of ages 18-75 years) were randomized to receive the addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> 100 mg once daily or placebo in a 1 : 1 ratio for 24 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, 212 were on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> (&gt;or=4 mg/day) monotherapy and 229 were on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> (&gt;or=4 mg/day) plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (&gt;or=1,500 mg/day) combination therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients exceeding pre-specified glycaemic thresholds during the double-blind treatment period were provided open-label rescue therapy (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>) until study end </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary efficacy analysis evaluated the change in HbA(1c) from baseline to Week 24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Secondary efficacy endpoints included fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG), 2-h post-meal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean baseline HbA(1c) was 8.34% in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> and placebo groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 24 weeks, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> reduced HbA(1c) by 0.74% (p &lt; 0.001) relative to placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the subset of patients on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> reduced HbA(1c) by 0.89% relative to placebo, compared with a reduction of 0.57% in the subset of patients on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> reduced FPG by 20.1 mg/dl (p &lt; 0.001) and increased homeostasis model assessment-beta, a marker of beta-cell function, by 12% (p &lt; 0.05) relative to placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In patients who underwent a meal tolerance test (n = 134), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> decreased 2-h post-prandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi>) by 36.1 mg/dl (p &lt; 0.001) relative to placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> was generally well tolerated, although there was a higher incidence of overall (60 vs. 47%) and drug-related adverse experiences (AEs) (15 vs. 7%) in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> group than in the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This was largely because of a higher incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> AEs (12 vs. 2%, respectively) in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> group compared with the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Body weight modestly increased with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> relative to placebo (+0.8 vs. -0.4 kg; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">Sitagliptin</z:chebi> 100 mg once daily significantly improved glycaemic control and beta-cell function in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who had inadequate glycaemic control with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> was generally well tolerated, with a modest increase in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> and body weight, consistent with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> therapy and the observed degree of glycaemic improvement </plain></SENT>
