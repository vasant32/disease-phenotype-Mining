<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare the joint effects of different types of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering treatment (oral drugs, insulin, and both) and duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on total and cardiovascular mortality among diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Study cohorts included 30,534 Ukrainian males and 58,909 females with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During the mean follow-up of 2.7 years, 7804 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for total mortality among diabetic patients, who used oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering drug (OGLD) only, insulin only, both insulin and OGLD, were 1.00, 2.34, and 2.22 in men, and 1.00, 2.12, and 2.20 in women, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The multivariate-adjusted HRs for total mortality across categories of duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (&lt;5, 5-9, 10-14, 15-19, and &gt;/=20 years) were 1.00, 1.17, 1.32, 1.43, and 1.57 (p(trend)&lt;0.001) in men, and 1.00, 1.13, 1.34, 1.74, and 1.68 (p(trend)&lt;0.001) in women, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diabetic patients who used insulin and reported longer duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had the highest risk of total mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Type 2 diabetic patients treated with insulin show a greater risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> than those treated with OGLD only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increasing duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is associated with an increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The combination of insulin treatment and longer duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> identifies a particular high <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
