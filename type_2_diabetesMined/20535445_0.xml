<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether selective inhibition of phosphodiesterase-5 by tadalafil has beneficial effects on peripheral microcirculation and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We enrolled seven postmenopausal women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and ten age-matched healthy women as controls in a placebo-controlled study to evaluate the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> metabolic effects of tadalafil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed microdialysis and blood flow measurements in muscle, and sampled arterial and deep venous blood before and after a single dose of tadalafil 20 mg or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Circulating <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin levels, muscle capillary recruitment as reflected by permeability surface area for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (PS(glu)) and forearm <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but not in the control group, tadalafil induced increases in the incremental AUC for PS(glu) (tadalafil vs placebo 41 +/- 11 vs 4 +/- 2 ml [100 g](-1) min(-1), p &lt; 0.05) and forearm <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake (46 +/- 9 vs 8 +/- 4 micromol [100 g](-1) min(-1), p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The variable that best predicted forearm <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake was PS(glu), which explained 70% of its variance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin concentrations were similar following treatment with placebo or tadalafil in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: This study suggests that tadalafil evokes positive metabolic effects in insulin-resistant women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
