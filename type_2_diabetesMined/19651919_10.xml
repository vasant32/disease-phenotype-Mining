<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Both short and long sleep duration have frequently been found to be associated with an increased risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present exploratory analysis was to examine the association between sleep duration and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after lifestyle intervention in overweight individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> in a 7-year prospective follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 522 individuals (aged 40-64 years) were randomly allocated either to an intensive diet-exercise counseling group or to a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> incidence during follow-up was calculated according to sleep duration at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sleep duration was obtained for a 24-h period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Physical activity, dietary intakes, body weight, and immune mediators (C-reactive protein and interleukin-6) were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Interaction between sleep duration and treatment group was statistically significant (P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the control group, the adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) (95% CI) for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were 2.29 (1.38-3.80) and 2.74 (1.67-4.50) in the sleep duration groups 9-9.5 h and &gt;or=10 h, respectively, compared with for that of the 7-8.5 h group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, sleep duration did not influence the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the intervention group; for sleep duration groups 9-9.5 h and &gt;or=10 h, the adjusted HRs (95% CI) were 1.10 (0.60-2.01) and 0.73 (0.34-1.56), respectively, compared with that in the reference group (7-8.5 h sleep) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Lifestyle intervention resulted in similar improvement in body weight, insulin sensitivity, and immune mediator levels regardless of sleep duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Long sleep duration is associated with increased type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Lifestyle intervention with the aim of weight reduction, healthy diet, and increased physical activity may ameliorate some of this excess risk </plain></SENT>
