<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Through an electronic search, 123 studies were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A literature search identified eight studies that met strict inclusion criterion of meta-analysis for 2-h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and five studies for the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were randomized controlled trials of &gt; or =6 months with lifestyle education that included a dietary intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects were adults diagnosed as being at high risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The difference in mean reduction of 2-h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> from baseline to the 1-year follow-up and relative risk (RR) of the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the lifestyle education group versus the control group were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall estimates were calculated using a random-effects model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Those estimates were confirmed by several models, and the possibility of selection bias was examined using a funnel plot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Lifestyle education intervention reduced 2-h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> by 0.84 mmol/l (95% CI 0.39-1.29) compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 1-year incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was reduced by approximately 50% (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.44-0.69) compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Results were stable and little changed if data were analyzed by subgroups or other statistical models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Funnel plots revealed no selection bias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Lifestyle education was effective for reducing both 2-h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and RR in high-risk individuals and may be a useful tool in preventing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
