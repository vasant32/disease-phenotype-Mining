<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The available data indicate that screening with the sole aim of decreasing the lead time between diagnosis and treatment is very unlikely to reduce these risks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast to macrovascular complications, some microvascular events such as background <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> could theoretically be prevented by earlier diagnosis and better glycaemic control, particularly in relatively young type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This, however, remains to be shown in controlled prospective intervention trials </plain></SENT>
