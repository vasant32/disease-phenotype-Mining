<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Type-2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is characterized by endotheliopathy, which increases target organ damage and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is excessive endothelin-1 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36088">TXA</z:chebi>(2) production, and abnormal vascular reactivity to endothelin-1, manifested as a paradoxical hypotensive action in <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> diabetic, but not lean rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the hypothesis that there is an alteration in the ET-A/ET-B receptor subtype sensitivity, and/or the interaction or cross-talk between ET-1 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36088">TXA</z:chebi>(2) in type-2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, using <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> diabetic rats and their lean littermates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hemodynamic studies were performed in lean and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> fatty diabetic rats of both sexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Laser doppler flowmetry was used to measure renal cortical (RCF) and medullary blood flow (MBF) responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dose response curves for mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), MBF and RCF in response to ET-1, U46619, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi>, and L-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NAME</z:e> (25mg/kg) were constructed after pre-treatment of the rats with either BQ610 1mg/kg i.v. or BQ788 0.5mg/kg i.v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effects of BQ610 and BQ788 on whole blood impedance aggregation were also assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BQ788, but not BQ610 abolished both the paradoxical hypotensive action of ET-1 in <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> diabetic rats (n=7 each, P&lt;0.001 ANOVA) as well as the dose-dependent rise in MBF (P&lt;0.001 ANOVA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>BQ788, but not BQ610 abolished the difference in response to ET-1 between lean and diabetic <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>U46619 caused a hypotensive action in male <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> rats which was abolished by L-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NAME</z:e> 25mg/kg or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> 10mg/kg i.v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The U46619 interaction with BQ788 on both MAP and MBF was significantly (P&lt;0.03 ANOVA) different between lean and diabetic <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>BQ788, but not BQ610 attenuated both the MAP and MBF responses to <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> or L-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NAME</z:e> P&lt;0.02 ANOVA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, BQ610 dose-dependently attenuated the slope of platelet aggregation in both lean and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> diabetic rats (P&lt;0.02 ANOVA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ET-B receptor antagonism abolished the abnormal vascular reactivity and MBF responses to ET-1, and also normalized the vasoactive responses to the level seen in healthy lean <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>ET-1 receptor blockade influences the responses to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36088">TXA</z:chebi>(2) receptor activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In the systemic and renal circulation, this interaction appears to be mostly ET-B receptor mediated, whilst in platelets, ET-A receptor role may be predominant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The interaction or cross-talk between ET-1 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36088">TXA</z:chebi>(2) is altered in the type-2 diabetic state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these pathophysiological changes may contribute to the vicious circle of diabetic endotheliopathy </plain></SENT>
