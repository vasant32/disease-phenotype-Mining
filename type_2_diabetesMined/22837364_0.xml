<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To test the effects of implementing computer-assisted Monitoring of Individual Needs in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> (MIND) in routine <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care on psychological status and glycemic control, identify predictors of poor psychological outcomes, and evaluate care providers' experiences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The MIND procedure was implemented as part of the annual review in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> clinics across eight countries in a prospective observational study with a 1-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MIND encompasses well-being (World Health Organization Five Well-Being Index [WHO-5]), <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related distress (Problem Areas in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> [PAID]), a Life Event Inventory, and the patient's agenda for their consultation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Medical data and agreed case-management actions were retrieved from the charts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the total 1,567 patients, 891 patients (57%) were monitored at a 1-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight percent of the patients screened positive for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and/or <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> distress at baseline and considered cases, 17% of whom were receiving psychological care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cases were significantly more often female and had type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and worse glycemic control compared with noncases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinically relevant improvements in WHO-5 and PAID were observed over time in cases, irrespective of referral (effects sizes 0.59 and 0.48, respectively; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Glycemic control did not change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Female sex, life events, and concomitant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> diseases were predictors of poor psychological outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MIND was well received by patients and staff </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MIND appears suitable for screening and discussion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0700361" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">emotional distress</z:e> as part of the annual review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Broader dissemination in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care is recommendable, but sustainability will depend on reimbursement and availability of support services </plain></SENT>
