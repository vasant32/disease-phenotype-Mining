<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A literature-based search was conducted to identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> relevant studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The fixed or random effect pooled measure was calculated mainly at the allele level to determine <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> bias among studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Further analyses were performed that stratified for ethnicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We examined 17 publications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stratified analysis for ethnicity and sensitivity analysis revealed that there was no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> between studies for these variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using an additive model, no significant association of the UCP2 -866G/A polymorphism with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk was observed, either in participants of Asian (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.96, 1.16) or of European (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.99, 1.07) descent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neither the UCP2 Ala55Val nor the UCP3 -55C/T polymorphism showed any significant association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk in Europeans (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.98, 1.09 for Ala55Val; OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.00, 1.09 for -55C/T) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, a statistically significant association was observed for both polymorphisms in participants of Asian descent (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.12, 1.36 for Ala55Val; OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.03, 1.28 for -55C/T) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our meta-analysis suggests that the UCP2 -866G/A polymorphism is unlikely to be associated with increased type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk in the populations investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, our results indicate that the UCP2 Ala55Val and UCP3 -55C/T polymorphisms may indeed be risk factors for susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in individuals of Asian descent, but not in individuals of European descent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This conclusion warrants confirmation by further studies </plain></SENT>
