<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Epidemiological studies show an increased incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in humans who were growth retarded at birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms by which an abnormal intrauterine milieu leads to the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in adulthood are not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a rat model of uteroplacental insufficiency was developed; intrauterine growth-retarded (IUGR) rats develop <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with a phenotype similar to that observed in the human with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We show here that administration of a pancreatic beta-cell trophic factor, exendin-4 (Ex-4), during the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetic</z:e> neonatal period dramatically prevents the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This occurs because neonatal Ex-4 prevents the progressive reduction in insulin-producing beta-cell mass that is observed in IUGR rats over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expression of PDX, a critical regulator of pancreas development and islet differentiation, is restored to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels, and islet beta-cell proliferation rates are normalized by the neonatal Ex-4 treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that exposure to Ex-4 in the newborn period reverses the adverse consequences of fetal programming and prevents the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in adulthood </plain></SENT>
