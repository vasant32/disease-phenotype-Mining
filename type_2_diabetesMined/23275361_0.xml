<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVETo compare β-cell function relative to insulin sensitivity, disposition index (DI), calculated from two clamps (2cDI, insulin sensitivity from the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp and first-phase insulin from the hyperglycemic clamp) with the DI calculated from the hyperglycemic clamp alone (hcDI).RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSComplete data from hyperglycemic and hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps were available for 330 youth, including 73 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> weight (NW), 168 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (OB-NGT), 57 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (OB-IGT), and 32 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (OB-T2DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The correlation between hcDI and 2cDI and Bland-Altman analysis of agreement between the two were examined.RESULTSInsulin sensitivity and first-phase insulin from hcDI showed a hyperbolic relationship </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The hcDI correlated significantly with 2cDI in the groups combined (r = 0.85, P &lt; 0.001) and within each group separately (r ≥ 62, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Similar to 2cDI, hcDI showed a declining pattern of β-cell function across the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-tolerance groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall, hcDI values were 27% greater than 2cDI, due to the hyperglycemic versus euglycemic conditions, reflected in a positive bias with Bland-Altman analysis.CONCLUSIONSβ-Cell function relative to insulin sensitivity could be accurately evaluated from a single hyperglycemic clamp, obviating the need for two separate clamp experiments, when lessening participant burden and reducing research costs are important considerations </plain></SENT>
