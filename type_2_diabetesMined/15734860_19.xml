<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Extracellular TGF-beta1 levels were rapidly increased after treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> in a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma-dependent mechanism because this secretion was blocked by the PPAR-gamma inhibitor GW9662 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>According to our results, we propose that the apoptotic effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> on VSMC depends on the following sequence: PPAR-gamma activation, TGF-beta1 release, and selective phospho-Smad2 nuclear recruitment </plain></SENT>
