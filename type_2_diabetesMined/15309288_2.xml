<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 294 such patients for up to 5 years to evaluate <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> changes and define the factors affecting progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Yearly <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> photographs were graded using the EURODIAB system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Prior to insulin therapy, 26.2% (77/294) of the patients had minimal non-proliferative diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (NPDR), 3.7% (n=11) had moderate NPDR and 1% (n=3) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0730278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">severe NPDR</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Over the first 3 years of insulin therapy, significant progression occurred in 36 subjects (12.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This comprised 5/193 (2.6%) without any <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> at baseline, 22/77 (28.5%) with minimal NPDR and 6/11 with moderate NPDR (54.5%) (chi2=56.1, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a control group of 70 patients who remained on oral hypoglycaemic agents, nine patients had significant worsening of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> over 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Over 5 years, 22/127 (17.3%) of patients (9/95 without and 13/32 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> at baseline [chi2=16.2, p&lt;0.001]) had significant progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Higher baseline HbA1c (p=0.002) and lower initial decrease in HbA1c (p=0.007) were each independent predictors of greater <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> progression over this period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no significant worsening of visual acuity in patients whose <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> progressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: After initiation of insulin treatment in Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, clinically significant worsening of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> over a 3-year period was uncommon in those with no <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (2.6%) but occurred in 31.8% of patients with any <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The risk of serious worsening of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> after insulin therapy is started in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may have been previously overestimated </plain></SENT>
