<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-seven insulin-treated men with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> [body mass index 30.8 +/- 2.6 kg/m(2) (mean +/- s.d.), <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c) 7.6 +/- 1.1%] were enrolled in this randomized, double-blind trial and participated in six euglycaemic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> clamp experiments [target blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (BG) 5 mmol/l] each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants received NN344 in three experiments at a dose of 0.8, 1.6 and 2.8 dosing units (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DU</z:e>) (1 DU corresponds to 6 nmol NN344) per kilogram of body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the other three experiments, the participants received 0.4, 0.8 and 1.4 U/kg of either insulin detemir or insulin glargine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The insulin preparations were characterized with regards to their effects on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion rates (GIRs) (in particular duration of action and within-subject and between-subject variabilities), BG, C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, free fatty acids (FFA), endogenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production (EGP) and peripheral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake (PGU) over 24 h post-dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean GIR profiles for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three preparations were similar in shape/flatness and showed increasing effect (area under the curve for GIR: AUC-GIR(total)) with increasing dose [low dose: 647 +/- 580, 882 +/- 634, 571 +/- 647 mg/kg (insulin detemir vs. NN344 vs. insulin glargine]; medium dose: 1203 +/- 816, 1720 +/- 1109, 1393 +/- 1203 mg/kg and high dose: 2171 +/- 1344, 3119 +/- 1549, 2952 +/- 2028 mg/kg; p = 0.48] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The duration of action increased with rising doses of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> insulin preparations, without major differences between treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BG remained below 7 mmol/l in nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Within-subject variability was lower for the albumin-bound insulin analogues, insulin detemir and NN344, than for insulin glargine (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Between-subject variability did not differ between treatments, nor did the effects on BG, C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, FFA, EGP or PGU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the time-action profiles and the duration of action of the albumin-bound insulin analogues, insulin detemir and NN344, were comparable with those of insulin glargine, whereas within-subject variability in the metabolic effect was significantly lower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, insulin detemir and NN344 seem to be as well suited as insulin glargine for once-daily administration in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The better predictability may be an important characteristic of the albumin-bound analogues as insulin detemir has already been shown to improve <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
