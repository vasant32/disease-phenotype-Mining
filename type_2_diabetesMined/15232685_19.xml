<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>Inflammation</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> are pathological mechanisms that are partially regulated by cell signalling through the p38 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Elements of the diabetic milieu such as high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and advanced glycation end-products induce activation of this pathway in renal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we examined whether p38 MAPK signalling is associated with the development of human and experimental diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Immunostaining identified phosphorylated (active) p38 MAPK in human biopsies with no abnormality ( n=6) and with Type 2 diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> ( n=12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Changes in kidney levels of phosphorylated p38 were assessed by immunostaining and western blotting in mice with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi>-induced Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> that had been killed after 0.5, 2, 3, 4 and 8 months, and in Type 2 diabetic db/db mice at 2, 4, 6 and 8 months of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Phosphorylated p38 was detected in some intrinsic cells in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human kidney, including podocytes, cortical tubules and occasional interstitial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Greater numbers of these phosphorylated p38+ cells were observed in diabetic patients, and phosphorylated p38 was identified in accumulating interstitial macrophages and myofibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A similar pattern of p38 activation was observed in both mouse models of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In mice, kidney levels of phosphorylated p38 increased (2-6 fold) following the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of Type 1 and Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In both mouse models, interstitial phosphorylated p38+ cells were associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e>, increased HbA(1)c levels and <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further assessment of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi>-induced diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> showed that interstitial phosphorylated p38+ cells correlated with interstitial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> (myofibroblasts, collagen) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Increased p38 MAPK signalling is a feature of human and experimental diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Time course studies in mouse models suggest that phosphorylation of p38 plays a pathological role, particularly in the development of interstitial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
