<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This increase in risk is consistent with a shared genetic susceptibility between Type 1 and Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have previously reported evidence that HLA-DR4-linked factors may represent a homogeneous subset of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>First, HLA-DR4 frequency was higher in Type 1 diabetic study subjects with a Type 2 diabetic parent than in Type 1 diabetic subjects whose parents were not diabetic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Second, a DR4-haplotype was transmitted from the Type 2 diabetic parent to the Type 1 offspring more often than expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data are consistent with the hypothesis that families with a Type 2 diabetic parent and Type 1 diabetic child, heavily determined by HLA-DR4 linked factors, may represent a homogeneous subset of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this report, we further explore the relationship between the high-risk HLA antigen (HLA-DR4) in study subjects with differing glycaemic status (National <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Data Group criteria) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this community-based study, we find evidence that HLA-DR4 is increased in study subjects with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and may be a marker for Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility </plain></SENT>
