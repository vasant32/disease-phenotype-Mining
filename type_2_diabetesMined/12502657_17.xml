<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We examined 2,953 Japanese male office workers aged 35-59 years who did not have impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (IFG) (a fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration of 6.1-6.9 mmol/l), type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (a fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration of &gt; or =7.0 mmol/l or receipt of hypoglycemic medication), medication for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, or a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations were measured at periodic annual health examinations from May 1994 through May 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a U-shaped association between alcohol consumption and the incidence of IFG or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during 7 years of follow-up, with the lowest incidence at alcohol intake of 23.0-45.9 g <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi>/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After controlling for age, family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, BMI, cigarette smoking, and physical activity, the relative risk for development of IFG or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with alcohol consumption of 23.0-45.9 g <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi>/day was 1.51 (95% CI, 1.07-2.13), 1.31 (95% CI, 0.93-1.84), 1.18 (95% CI, 0.87-1.61), and 1.43 (95% CI, 1.01-2.02) with alcohol consumption of 0, 0.1-22.9, 46.0-68.9, and &gt; or =69.0 g <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi>/day, respectively (P for quadratic trend = 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analyses by presence or absence of a risk factor revealed that a U-shaped association was more evident in older men, men without a family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and nonsmokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that moderate alcohol consumption among apparently healthy Japanese men is associated with reduced risk for development of IFG or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
