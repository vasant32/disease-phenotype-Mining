<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Insulin secretion progressively declines in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and following islet transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both are characterized by the presence of islet amyloid derived from islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (IAPP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present studies, we examined the action of extracellular human IAPP (h-IAPP) on <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and function of human islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because oligomers of h-IAPP are known to cause membrane disruption, we questioned if application of h-IAPP oligomers to human islets would lead to disruption of islet architecture (specifically cell-to-cell adherence) and a decrease in coordinate function (e.g., increased entropy of insulin secretion and diminished coordinate secretory bursts) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both hypotheses are affirmed, leading to a novel hypothesis for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948379" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">impaired insulin secretion</z:e> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and following islet transplantation, specifically disrupted cell-to-cell adherence in islets through the actions of membrane-disrupting IAPP oligomers </plain></SENT>
