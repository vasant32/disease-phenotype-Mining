<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the underlying reasons for this increased risk is atherogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidaemia</z:e>, which is common in this patient group and characterized by low plasma levels of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>), increased levels of serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, specifically <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47776">very low-density lipoprotein triglycerides</z:chebi>, and an increase in small, dense <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>) particles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Current management strategies focus on the initial use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> or fibrate therapy (the latter approach indicated in patients with pronounced hypertriglyceridaemia) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recent treatment guidelines also emphasize the need for reduction in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>) below 100 mg/dl (2.6 mmol/l) in diabetic patients, as this patient group has a clustering of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> that collectively lead to an excess risk of premature mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multidrug <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-modifying therapy has been proposed to further reduce CHD risk in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adding <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15940">nicotinic acid</z:chebi> to primary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> therapy would be a logical approach based on the complementary therapeutic benefits of these treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="15940">Nicotinic acid</z:chebi> is the most potent agent currently available for raising <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> and is also effective in reducing <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, clinical trial data have shown that <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15940">nicotinic acid</z:chebi> can be safely used in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Data from the Arterial Biology for the Investigation of the Treatment Effects of Reducing Cholesterol (ARBITER 2) study in patients with established CHD and low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> (27% of whom had type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) show the atheroprotective effects of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15940">nicotinic acid</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> combination therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The clinical benefits of this combination therapy are indicated by subgroup analyses from the <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Treatment Study, which showed 40% reduction in coronary event frequency in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Together, these data support the proposed strategy of aggressive multidrug treatment of diabetic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidaemia</z:e> to improve patient outcome </plain></SENT>
