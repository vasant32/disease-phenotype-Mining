<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated α and β-cell responses to oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) and isoglycaemic intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion (IIGI) in lean and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> persons with T2DM or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (NGT) to elucidate the impact of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> on the incretin effect and incretin hormone and glucagon responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four hour 50-g OGTT and IIGI were performed in (i) Eight <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with T2DM [mean body mass index (BMI): 37 (range: 35-41) kg/m(2)]; (ii) Eight <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects with NGT [BMI: 33 (35-38) kg/m(2)]; (iii) Eight lean patients with T2DM [BMI: 24 (22-25) kg/m(2)]; and (iv) Eight lean healthy subjects [BMI: 23 (20-25) kg/m(2)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incretin effect was significantly (p &lt; 0.05) reduced in patients with T2DM {<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>: 7 ± 7% [mean ± standard error of the mean (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>)]; lean: 29 ± 8%; p = 0.06)} and was lower in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects (41 ± 4%) than in lean subjects with NGT (53 ± 4%; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>Obese</z:mp> subjects with NGT were also characterized by elevated fasting plasma glucagon levels, but the inappropriate glucagon responses to OGTT found in the T2DM patients were not evident in these subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that reduced incretin effect and fasting hyperglucagonaemia constitute very early steps in the pathophysiology of T2DM detectable even in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> people who despite their insulin-resistant state have NGT </plain></SENT>
