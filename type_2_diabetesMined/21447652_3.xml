<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The endocannabinoid (EC) system has been implicated as an important regulator of energy homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, EC tone is elevated in peripheral tissues including liver, muscle, fat, and also centrally, particularly in the hypothalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB₁) blockade with the centrally and peripherally acting rimonabant induces <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and improves <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis while also causing psychiatric adverse effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The relative contributions of peripheral versus central EC signaling on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis remain to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to test whether the central EC system regulates systemic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> fluxes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We determined <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> fluxes in male Sprague-Dawley rats during intracerebroventricular infusions of either WIN55,212-2 (WIN) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22610">arachidonoyl</z:chebi>-2'-chloroethylamide (ACEA) while controlling circulating insulin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels through hyperinsulinemic, euglycemic clamp studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conversely, we fed rats a high-fat diet for 3 days and then blocked central EC signaling with an intracerebroventricular infusion of rimonabant while assessing <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> fluxes during a clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Central CB₁ activation is sufficient to impair <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Either WIN or ACEA infusions acutely impaired insulin action in both liver and adipose tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conversely, in a model of overfeeding-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, CB₁ antagonism restored hepatic insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Thus central EC tone plays an important role in regulating hepatic and adipose tissue insulin action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that peripherally restricted CB₁ <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi>, which may lack psychiatric side effects, are also likely to be less effective than brain-permeable CB₁ <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> in ameliorating <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
