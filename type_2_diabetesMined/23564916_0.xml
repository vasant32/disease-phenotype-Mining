<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Participants received open-label insulin glargine (targeting fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels ≤5.3 mmol/L [95 mg/dL]) or standard glycemic care and double-blind therapy with a 1-g capsule of n-3FA or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary trial outcome was the annualized rate of change in maximum CIMT for the common carotid, bifurcation, and internal carotid artery segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Secondary outcomes were the annualized rates of change in maximum CIMT for the common carotid and the common carotid plus bifurcation, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Baseline followed by annual ultrasounds were obtained during a median follow-up of 4.9 years.RESULTSCompared with standard care, insulin glargine reduced the primary CIMT outcome, but the difference was not statistically significant (difference = 0.0030 ± 0.0021 mm/year; P = 0.145) and significantly reduced the secondary CIMT outcomes (differences of 0.0033 ± 0.0017 mm/year [P = 0.049] and 0.0045 ± 0.0021 mm/year [P = 0.032], respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in the primary and secondary outcomes between the n-3FA supplement and placebo groups.CONCLUSIONSIn people with CV disease and/or CV risk factors and dysglycemia, insulin glargine used to target normoglycemia modestly reduced CIMT progression, whereas daily supplementation with n-3FA had no effect on CIMT progression </plain></SENT>
