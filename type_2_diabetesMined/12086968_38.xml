<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Body size at birth is an indicator of the intrauterine environment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is also a well-established association between the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma2 gene and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We therefore assessed whether the effects of the Pro12Ala polymorphism of the PPAR-gamma2 gene on insulin sensitivity and insulin concentrations in adult life are modified by size at birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that the effects of the Pro12Pro and Pro12Ala polymorphisms of the PPAR-gamma2 gene in elderly people depended on their body size at birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The well-known association between <z:mp ids='MP_0001265'>small body size</z:mp> at birth and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> was seen only in individuals with the high-risk Pro12Pro allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In those who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birth weight</z:hpo>, the Pro12Pro polymorphism of the PPAR-gamma2 gene was associated with increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.002) and elevated insulin concentrations (P &lt; 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These interactions between the effects of the Pro12Ala polymorphisms of the PPAR-gamma2 gene on adult traits and the effects of birth weight link two previously unknown associations together within the context of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We suggest that these findings reflect gene-environment interaction </plain></SENT>
