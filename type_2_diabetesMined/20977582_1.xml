<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate timing of protein ingestion relative to resistance exercise training (RT) on body composition, cardiometabolic risk factors, glycaemic control and resting energy expenditure (REE) during <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> on a high-protein (HP) diet in overweight and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-four men/women with T2DM (age 57 ± 7 years and body mass index 34.9 ± 4.2 kg m(-2) ) were randomly assigned to the ingestion of a HP meal (860 kJ, 21 g protein, 0.7 g fat, 29.6 g carbohydrate) either immediately prior to RT or at least 2 h following RT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants followed a 16-week, energy-restricted (6-7 MJ day(-1) ), HP diet (carbohydrate : protein : fat 43 : 33 : 22) and participated in supervised RT (3 day week(-1) ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Outcomes were assessed pre- and postintervention at 16 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was an overall reduction in bodyweight (-11.9 ± 6.1 kg), fat mass (-10.0 ± 4.4 kg), fat-free mass (-1.9 ± 3.1 kg), waist circumference (-12.1 ± 5.3 cm), REE (-742 ± 624 kJ day(-1) ), <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (-1.9 ± 1.7 mmol l(-1) ), insulin (-6.1 ± 6.7 mU l(-1) ) and glycosylated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (-1.1 ± 0.1%), p ≤ 0.01 time for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> variables, with no difference between groups (p ≥ 0.41 group effect) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Strength improved and cardiometabolic risk factors were reduced similarly in both groups; single repetition maximum chest press 11.0 ± 8.7 kg, single repetition maximum lat pull down 9.9 ± 6.0 kg, total cholesterol -0.6 ± 0.5 mmol l(-1) , <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> -0.1 ± 0.2 mmol l(-1) , <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> -0.3 ± 0.5 mmol l(-1) , <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> -0.6 ± 0.7 mmol l(-1) , blood pressure (systolic/diastolic) -13 ± 10/-7 ± 7 mmHg (p ≤ 0.04 time effect, p ≥ 0.24 group effect) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A HP, energy-restricted diet with RT was effective in improving glycaemic control, body composition, strength and cardiometabolic risk factors in overweight/<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with T2DM irrespective of altering the timing of protein ingestion relative to RT </plain></SENT>
