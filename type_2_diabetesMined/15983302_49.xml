<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Adults (n = 107) &gt; or =60 years of age (mean age 66 years) with insulin-treated type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (mean duration 16 years, BMI 32 kg/m(2), and HbA(1C) [A1C] 8.2%) were randomized to CSII (using insulin lispro) or <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53218">MDI</z:chebi> (using insulin lispro and insulin glargine) in a two-center, 12-month, prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Efficacy was assessed with A1C, safety by frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>, and treatment satisfaction and quality of life with the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Quality of Life Clinical Trial Questionnaire and the 36-item short-form health survey, version 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-eight CSII subjects (91%) and 50 MDI subjects (93%) completed the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean A1C fell by 1.7 +/- 1.0% in the CSII group to 6.6% and by 1.6 +/- 1.2% in the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53218">MDI</z:chebi> group to 6.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The difference in A1C between treatment groups was not statistically significant (P = 0.20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eighty-one percent of CSII subjects and 90% of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53218">MDI</z:chebi> subjects experienced at least one episode of minor (self-treated) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> (P = 0.17), and three CSII and six <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53218">MDI</z:chebi> subjects experienced severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> (P = 0.49) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rates of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> were similarly low in the two groups (CSII 0.08 and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53218">MDI</z:chebi> 0.23 events per person-year, P = 0.61) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>Weight gain</z:mp> did not differ between groups (P = 0.70) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment satisfaction improved significantly with both CSII and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53218">MDI</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.0001), and the difference between groups was not statistically significant (P = 0.58) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In older subjects with insulin-treated type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, both CSII and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53218">MDI</z:chebi> achieved excellent glycemic control with good safety and patient satisfaction </plain></SENT>
