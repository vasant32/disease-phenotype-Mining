<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A close association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> is well recognized, but it is not known whether this relationship is affected by the genetic susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Insulin response to a 75-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> load was evaluated in healthy nondiabetic Caucasians with first-degree family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (relatives, n = 55) and those without family history (nonrelatives, n = 33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A significant correlation between the BMI and insulin response (area under the curve [AUC] during the 2-h period) was seen in nonrelatives (r = 0.68, P &lt; 0.0001) but not in the relatives (r = 0.12, P = 0.37) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (BMI) was the primary determinant of insulin response in nonrelatives (P &lt; 0.001), whereas among the relatives, BMI had no significant impact (P = 0.28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, these distinctions between the relatives and nonrelatives remained after adjusting for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level, age, and gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among first-degree relatives, the commonly observed association between BMI and insulin response is lost, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> is present even in the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>First-degree family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may confer <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> that is independent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, this could suggest a pathological regulation of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-insulin feedback loop, e.g., a defective recognition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> </plain></SENT>
