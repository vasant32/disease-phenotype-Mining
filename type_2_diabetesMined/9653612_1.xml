<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Thirteen subjects were selected from 150 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000802'>erectile dysfunction</z:hpo> who were studied in accordance with the National Institutes of Health consensus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 13 subjects (group A), aged 55 +/- 8 years, had acceptable metabolic control (HbA1c, &lt; 8%); no arterial or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235522" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">venous diseases</z:e> or initial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030848" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Peyronie's disease</z:e>, as evaluated by penile Doppler ultrasonography and intracavernous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15544">prostaglandin E1</z:chebi> injection; and penile tumescence at the base (PTB) &lt; 30 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Group B consisted of 13 control subjects with the same characteristics, including mean age (53.1 +/- 9 years), metabolic control (HbA1c, 7.3 +/- 0.7%), and duration of disease (8.3 +/- 0.7 years), but PTB was &gt; 30 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Student's t test was used to evaluate differences in the results of autonomic cardiovascular tests, somatic tests (vibration perception threshold [VPT]), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011882" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic neuropathy</z:e> score (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="16991">DNS</z:chebi>) in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The coefficient of variation of PTB was evaluated using the Rigiscan device (Dacomed, Minneapolis, MN), and Bayes' test was used to test sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive values of the cardiovascular tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with PTB &lt; 30 mm had significant (P &lt; 0.05) impairment of parasympathetic tests (lying to standing, P &lt; 0.02; standing to lying, P &lt; 0.04; squat test, P &lt; 0.03) compared with subjects with higher PTB values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No difference in <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16991">DNS</z:chebi> and VPT at the base and tip of the penis was found between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The variability of the test is 10% in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects and 15% in both groups of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PTB sensitivity was 54%, specificity 89%, and positive predictive value 79% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular diseases</z:e>, the PTB evaluated by Rigiscan is related to impairment of the autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A PTB value &lt; 30 mm may be considered a useful, noninvasive marker in studying parasympathetic damage of the penile region </plain></SENT>
