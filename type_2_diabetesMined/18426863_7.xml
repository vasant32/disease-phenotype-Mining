<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The mechanisms behind the association between <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50211">retinol</z:chebi>-binding protein-4 (RBP4) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> are not well understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An interaction between iron and vitamin A status, of which RBP4 is a surrogate, has long been recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that iron-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> could be behind the impaired insulin action caused by RBP4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Serum ferritin and RBP4 concentration and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> were evaluated in a sample of middle-aged men (n = 132) and in a replication independent study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum RBP4 was also studied before and after iron <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, the effect of iron on RBP4 release was evaluated in vitro in adipose tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A positive correlation between circulating RBP4 and log serum ferritin (r = 0.35 and r = 0.61, respectively; P &lt; 0.0001) was observed in both independent studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum RBP4 concentration was higher in men than women in parallel to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003281'>increased ferritin</z:hpo> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On multiple regression analyses to predict serum RBP4, log serum ferritin contributed significantly to RBP4 variance after controlling for BMI, age, and homeostasis model assessment value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Serum RBP4 concentration decreased after iron <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> in type 2 diabetic patients (percent mean difference -13.7 [95% CI -25.4 to -2.04]; P = 0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The iron donor lactoferrin led to increased dose-dependent adipose tissue release of RBP4 (2.4-fold, P = 0.005) and increased RBP4 expression, while apotransferrin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">deferoxamine</z:chebi> led to decreased RBP4 release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between circulating RBP4 and iron stores, both cross-sectional and after iron <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath>, and in vitro findings suggest that iron could play a role in the RBP4-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> relationship </plain></SENT>
