<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Overweight, middle-aged men (n = 172) and women (n = 350) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> were randomised in 1993-1998 to an intensive lifestyle intervention group (n = 265), aiming at weight reduction, dietary modification and increased physical activity, or to a control group (n = 257) that received general lifestyle information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was a diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> based on annual OGTTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Secondary outcomes included changes in body weight, glycaemia, physical activity and diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After active intervention (median 4 years, range 1-6 years), participants still free of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and willing to continue their participation (200 in the intervention group and 166 in the control group) were further followed until <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosis, dropout or the end of 2009, with a median total follow-up of 9 years and a time span of 13 years from baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the total follow-up the adjusted HR for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (intervention group vs control group) was 0.614 (95% CI 0.478, 0.789; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The corresponding HR during the post-intervention follow-up was 0.672 (95% CI 0.477, 0.947; p = 0.023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The former intervention group participants sustained lower absolute levels of body weight, fasting and 2 h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and a healthier diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adherence to lifestyle changes during the intervention period predicted greater risk reduction during the total follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Lifestyle intervention in people at high risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> induces sustaining lifestyle change and results in long-term prevention of progression to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
