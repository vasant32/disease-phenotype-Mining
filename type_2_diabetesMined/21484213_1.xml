<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As IAPP is co-secreted with insulin, we hypothesised that IAPP secretion is necessary for amyloid formation and that treatments that increase insulin (and IAPP) secretion would thereby increase amyloid formation and toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also hypothesised that the unique properties of the glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> exendin-4 to maintain or increase beta cell mass would offset the amyloid-induced toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Islets from amyloid-forming human IAPP transgenic and control non-transgenic mice were cultured for 48 h in 16.7 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> alone (control) or with exendin-4, <z:chebi fb="11" ids="32588">potassium chloride</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4495">diazoxide</z:chebi> or somatostatin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Human IAPP and insulin release, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_34'>amyloid deposition</z:mpath>, beta cell area/islet area, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and AKT phosphorylation levels were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In control human IAPP transgenic islets, amyloid formation was associated with increased beta cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and beta cell loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increasing human IAPP release with exendin-4 or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi> increased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_34'>amyloid deposition</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, while <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi> further increased beta cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and beta cell loss, exendin-4 did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conversely, decreasing human IAPP release with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4495">diazoxide</z:chebi> or somatostatin limited amyloid formation and its toxic effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment with exendin-4 was associated with an increase in AKT phosphorylation compared with control and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi>-treated islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: IAPP release is necessary for islet amyloid formation and its toxic effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, use of insulin secretagogues to treat type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may result in increased islet amyloidogenesis and beta cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, the AKT-associated anti-apoptotic effects of GLP-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> such as exendin-4 may limit the toxic effects of increased islet amyloid </plain></SENT>
