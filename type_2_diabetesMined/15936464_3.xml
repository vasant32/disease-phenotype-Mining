<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we hypothesized that Apo e4 allele increases the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> risk from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> electrocardiographic change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From January 1993 to December 1999, 46 type 2 diabetic patients with e4/4 or e4/3, 96 with e3/3 and 45 with e2/2 or e3/2 genotypes were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects were unrelated elderly type 2 diabetic patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> electrocardiographic change, aged 60-87 years, and their cardiac function were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the class I stage at their time of enrollment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A follow-up study of 3-10 years was undergone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results are as follows: At baseline, serum total cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>) cholesterol concentrations were higher in subjects with e4/3 or e4/4 than in subjects with e2/2 or e3/2 (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">Lipoprotein</z:chebi>(a) concentration was lower in subjects with e2/2 or e3/2 than in subjects with e3/3 and e4/3 or e4/4 (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During the 3-10 years follow-up period, a total of 55 patients who died from CAD were recorded in this sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with patients with e3/3 (p = 0.024) and patients with e2/2 or e2/3 genotypes (p = 0.002), the mortality rate of CAD in patients with e4/3 or e4/4 genotypes was the highest (47.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Stepwise discriminant analysis revealed that in the diabetic population studied Apo e4 allele was independently and significantly associated with CAD <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (B = 0.65) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the strength of the association decreased (B = 0.44) when total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>(a) were included in the model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we concluded that Apo e4 allele increases the risk of CAD <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in elderly type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> electrocardiographic change </plain></SENT>
