<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The intensive treatment of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> to achieve strict glycemic control is a common clinical goal, but it is associated with an increased incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Becoming hypoglycemic while driving is a hazardous condition and may lead to a greater incidence of driving mishaps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study investigated whether <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is associated with increased risk of driving mishaps and correlates of such a relationship </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: During routine visits to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> specialty clinics in seven U.S. and four European cities, consecutive adults with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and nondiabetic spouse control subjects (n = 341, 332, and 363, respectively) completed an anonymous questionnaire concerning <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and driving </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Type 1 diabetic drivers reported significantly more crashes, moving violations, episodes of hypoglycemic stupor, required assistance, and mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> while driving as compared with type 2 diabetic drivers or spouse control subjects (P &lt; 0.01-0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Type 2 diabetic drivers had driving mishap rates similar to nondiabetic spouses, and the use of insulin or oral agents for treatment had no effect on the occurrence of driving mishaps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Crashes among type 1 diabetic drivers were associated with more frequent episodes of hypoglycemic stupor while driving, less frequent blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring before driving, and the use of insulin injection therapy as compared with pump therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One-half of the type 1 diabetic drivers and three-quarters of the type 2 diabetic drivers had never discussed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> and driving with their physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Type 1 diabetic drivers are at increased risk for driving mishaps, but type 2 diabetic drivers, even on insulin, appear not to be at a higher risk than nondiabetic individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clinical and treatment factors appear to increase risk, e.g., more frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> while driving, method of insulin delivery, and infrequent self-testing before driving </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Physicians are encouraged to talk to their type 1 diabetic patients about <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> and driving </plain></SENT>
