<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective analyses were conducted using an electronic medical record (EMR) database among adult patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> initiating exenatide or glargine between 1 November 2006 and 30 April 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cohorts were propensity-score matched to control baseline demographics, clinical measures, health status and medication use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The changes from baseline to a 12-month follow-up period for A1C (primary outcome), weight, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels were compared between the matched cohorts using paired tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Propensity-score matching between the exenatide (n = 4494) and glargine (n = 5424) cohorts led to 2683 matched pairs with comparable characteristics, including age, gender and baseline clinical values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The exenatide cohort achieved a greater mean reduction in A1C (-0.6% vs. -0.4%, p &lt; 0.01), weight (-2.6 kg vs. -0.2 kg, p &lt; 0.01), BMI (-0.8 kg/m(2) vs. -0.04 kg/m(2) , p &lt; 0.01) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) (-1.8 mmHg vs. -0.1 mmHg, p &lt; 0.01) in the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The changes in diastolic blood pressure and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels were not significantly different between cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Compared to glargine, exenatide-treated patients experienced significant reductions in A1C, weight, BMI and SBP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Acknowledging the limitations of observational research, exenatide showed greater clinical effectiveness than glargine from a large EMR database in the ambulatory care setting </plain></SENT>
