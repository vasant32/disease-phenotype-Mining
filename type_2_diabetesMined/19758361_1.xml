<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> free fatty acids (FFA) exposure impairs pancreatic beta-cell function and induces beta-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study is to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We exposed INS-1E pancreatic beta-cell line to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30823">oleate</z:chebi>, and measured the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect of FFA on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15889">sterol</z:chebi> regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1c lipogenic pathway, and expression of genes involved in beta-cell functions, including AMPK (<z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase), UCP-2 (uncoupling protein-2), IRS-2 (insulin receptor substrate-2), PDX-1 (pancreatic duodenal homeobox-1), GLUT-2 (<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transporter-2) and B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>/<z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>-2 (Bcl-2) were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> of these exposed cells was determined by MitoCapture, Annexin V-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37990">Cy3</z:chebi> or terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick-end labeling assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cell <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> accumulation was measured by oil red O staining or TG extraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also SREBP-1c expression knockdown were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: FFA treatment resulted in SREBP-1c overexpression, impaired GSIS, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> accumulation, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of INS-1E cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, the expression of lipogenic genes and UCP-2 were upregulated, but AMPK, IRS-2, PDX-1, GLUT-2 and Bcl-2 were downregulated in the exposed cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, these lipotoxic effects of FFA were largely prevented by induction of a SREBP-1c small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest a strong correlation between FFA treatment and SREBP-1c activation in INS-1E cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>SREBP-1c might be a major factor responsible for beta-cell lipotoxicity, and SREBP-1c knockdown could protect INS-1E cells from lipotoxicity, which is implicating a therapeutic potential for treating <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> related to lipotoxicity </plain></SENT>
