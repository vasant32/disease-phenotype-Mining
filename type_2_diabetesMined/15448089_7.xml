<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the effect of conophylline on the differentiation of pancreatic precursor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the rat pancreatic rudiment in organ culture, conophylline inhibited the formation of cystic structure and increased the number of insulin-positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conophylline also markedly increased the expression of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> for insulin and the number of pancreatic duodenal homeobox-1-positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These effects of conophylline were similar to those of activin A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also examined the effect of conophylline on neonatal rats treated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi>, a model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment with conophylline significantly reduced the plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration and <z:mp ids='MP_0005292'>improved glucose tolerance</z:mp> in response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> loading </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The insulin content and the beta-cell mass at 2 months were significantly increased by conophylline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The number of islet-like cell clusters and pancreatic duodenal homeobox-1-positive ductal cells was greater in conophylline-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that conophylline induces differentiation of pancreatic precursor cells and increases the formation of beta-cells </plain></SENT>
