<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the short biological half-life of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> after cleavage by dipeptidylpeptidase IV (DPP IV) is a major limitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of DPP IV activity and the development of resistant GLP-1 analogues is the subject of ongoing research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we determined cell growth, insulin content, insulin accumulation and insulin secretory function of a insulin-secreting cell line cultured for 3 days with either GLP-1, GLP-1 plus the DPP IV inhibitor diprotin A (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="39867,4640,53488">DPA</z:chebi>) or stable N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-GLP-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Native GLP-1 was rapidly degraded by DPP IV during culture with accumulation of the inactive metabolite GLP-1(9-36)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29337,32988">amide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inclusion of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="39867,4640,53488">DPA</z:chebi> or use of the DPP IV-resistant analogue, N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-GLP-1, improved cellular function compared to exposure to GLP-1 alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most notably, basal and accumulated insulin secretion was enhanced, and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> responsiveness was improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, prolonged GLP-1 treatment resulted in GLP-1 receptor desensitization regardless of DPP IV status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that prevention of DPP IV action is necessary for beneficial effects of GLP-1 on pancreatic beta cells and that prolonged exposure to GLP-1(9-36)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29337,32988">amide</z:chebi> may be detrimental to insulin secretory function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These observations also support the ongoing development of DPP-IV-resistant forms of GLP-1, such as N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-GLP-1 </plain></SENT>
