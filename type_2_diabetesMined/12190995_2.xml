<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: PPAR transactivation study was performed in HEK293T cells using ligand binding domains of PPARalpha, gamma and delta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Insulin-resistant db/db and ob/ob mice were treated orally with different doses of PMT13 at 0.3-10 mg/kg/day for 15 and 14 days respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> fa/fa rats were treated with 3 mg/kg (p.o.) dose of the compound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>, free fatty acid and insulin levels were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Liver <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> 6-phosphatase (G6-Ptase) and adipose <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> lipase activity was measured in treated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Isolated rat aortic preparations preconstricted with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi> were used to study the vascular relaxation potential of PMT13 in presence of insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A 28-day oral toxicity study was performed in Wistar rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PMT13 showed similar PPARgamma activation as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>, but failed to show any activity against PPARalpha or PPARdelta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and diabetic db/db and ob/ob mice, PMT13 showed better reduction in plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> and insulin levels than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> and an improvement in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In insulin-resistant <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> fa/fa rat model, PMT13 treatment showed better reduction in plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>, free fatty acid and insulin levels than that of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Treated mice showed decreased G6-Ptase activity in liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The LPL activity was increased in post-<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> plasma and epididymal fat of treated db/db mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In an isolated, precontracted rat aortic preparation, PMT13 treatment significantly increased insulin-induced relaxation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A 28-day oral toxicity study in rats showed no treatment-related adverse effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our studies indicate that PMT13 is a potent activator of PPARgamma with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi>, hypolipidaemic and insulin-sensitizing properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Additionally, PMT13 inhibited liver G6-Ptase activity and <z:mp ids='MP_0011578'>increased lipoprotein lipase activity</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>It showed improvement in insulin-induced vasorelaxation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The compound also showed a good safety margin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Therefore, PMT13 can be a potential drug candidate for future development </plain></SENT>
