<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of intensive versus conventional therapy for 8 years as applied in the Steno-2 study in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A Markov model was developed to incorporate event and risk data from Steno-2 and account Danish-specific costs to project life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE), and lifetime direct medical costs expressed in year 2005 Euros </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical and cost outcomes were projected over patient lifetimes and discounted at 3% annually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity analyses were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Intensive treatment was associated with increased life expectancy, QALE, and lifetime costs compared with conventional treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean +/- SD undiscounted life expectancy was 18.1 +/- 7.9 years with intensive treatment and 16.2 +/- 7.3 years with conventional treatment (difference 1.9 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Discounted life expectancy was 13.4 +/- 4.8 years with intensive treatment and 12.4 +/- 4.5 years with conventional treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lifetime costs (discounted) for intensive and conventional treatment were euro45,521 +/- 19,697 and euro41,319 +/- 27,500, respectively (difference euro4,202) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increased costs with intensive treatment were due to increased pharmacy and consultation costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Discounted QALE was 1.66 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) higher for intensive (10.2 +/- 3.6 QALYs) versus conventional (8.6 +/- 2.7 QALYs) treatment, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of euro2,538 per QALY gained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This is considered a conservative estimate because accounting prescription of generic drugs and capturing indirect costs would further favor intensified therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: From a health care payer perspective in Denmark, intensive therapy was more cost-effective than conventional treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Assuming that patients in both arms were treated in a primary care setting, intensive therapy became dominant (cost- and lifesaving) </plain></SENT>
