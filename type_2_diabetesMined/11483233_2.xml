<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The study was performed to test the effect of a structured intervention in diabetic patients with poor glycaemic control in an ophthalmological department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients attending the ophthalmological out-patient department with the need for laser therapy due to diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> were investigated from January to March 1998 (Type 1: n=20, Type 2: n=144) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>If an HbA(1c)-level higher than 9.0% was found the patient was informed within 1 week and a standardised letter was sent to the primary care physician and the local ophthalmologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Over the first 3 months of 1999 the effect was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HbA(1c) values higher than 9.0% were found in eight/20 of the patients (40%) with Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and in 61/144 of the patients (54%) with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 55% this new information in the context of the need for laser therapy resulted in the acceptance of a structured intervention by the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This led to an improvement of the HbA(1c) in the people with Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with poor blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control can be identified in an ophthalmological department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The need for laser therapy can be used to motivate the patients for a significant improvement of the quality of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control </plain></SENT>
