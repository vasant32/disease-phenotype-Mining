<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) is a model of these human <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for SHR defects in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and fatty acid metabolism, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002155'>hypertriglyceridemia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> map to a single region on rat chromosome 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genetic analysis of an SHR derived from a National Institutes of Health colony led to the identification of a causative mutation in the SHR Cd36 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have investigated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and fatty acid metabolism in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-prone SHR (SHRSP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate defects in insulin action on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15866">2-deoxy-D-glucose</z:chebi> transport (SHRSP 3.3 +/- 1.5 vs. 21.0 +/- 7.4 pmol x min(-1) x [20 microl packed cells](-1), SHRSP vs. WKY, respectively, P = 0.01) and inhibition of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi>-stimulated lipolysis (P &lt; 0.05 at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> concentrations of insulin) in adipocytes isolated from SHRSP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, basal levels of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi>-stimulated nonesterified free fatty acid (NEFA) release and plasma levels of NEFA are similar in SHRSP and WKY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results are in agreement with the data on the SHR.4 congenic strain, which suggested that the QTL containing Cd36 mutations accounted for the entire defect in basal <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> action but only for approximately 40% of the SHR defect in insulin action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the SHR, both abnormalities appear consequent of defective Cd36 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because Cd36 sequence and expression are apparently <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in SHRSP, it is likely that the molecular mechanism for defective insulin action in this strain is caused by a gene(s) different than Cd36 </plain></SENT>
