<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This Canadian prospective national surveillance study involved a network of pediatricians, pediatric endocrinologists, family physicians, and adult endocrinologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Incidence rates were calculated using Canadian Census population data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Descriptive statistics were used to illustrate demographic and clinical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From a population of 7.3 million children, 345 cases of non-type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The observed minimum incidence rates of type 2, medication-induced, and monogenic <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were 1.54, 0.4, and 0.2 cases per 100,000 children aged &lt;18 years per year, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On average, children with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were aged 13.7 years and 8% (19 of 227) presented before 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ethnic minorities were overrepresented, but 25% (57 of 227) of children with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were Caucasian </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of children with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 95% (206 of 216) were <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and 37% (43 of 115) had at least one comorbidity at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This is the first prospective national surveillance study in Canada to report the incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in children and also the first in the world to report the incidence of medication-induced and monogenic <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Rates of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were higher than expected with important regional variation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results support recommendations that screening for comorbidity should occur at diagnosis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
