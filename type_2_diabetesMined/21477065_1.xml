<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methods: One hundred and one subjects were randomized to <z:chebi fb="10" ids="17345">GMP</z:chebi> or IM regimens for 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was the change in HbA1c and secondary outcomes were changes in fasting plasma, and postprandial plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucoses</z:chebi> and the number of patients achieving a drop in HbA1c of over 1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Other secondary outcomes were changes in the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile, C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> level, body weight as well as physician assessments of efficacy and patient assessment of tolerability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results: The primary outcome of a change in HbA1c showed a trend towards a lower HbA1c with <z:chebi fb="10" ids="17345">GMP</z:chebi> therapy (-1.33% vs. -0.83%; p = 0.059) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of subjects achieving a decrease in HbA1c of greater than 1.0% was significantly greater in the <z:chebi fb="10" ids="17345">GMP</z:chebi> therapy (72.5% vs. 22%; p = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both regimens equally and significantly reduced fasting and postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels (p = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>Weight gain</z:mp> was nonsignificantly greater with IM (2.69 vs. 0.92 kg; p = 0.223) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Investigator assessment of efficacy was significantly better with <z:chebi fb="10" ids="17345">GMP</z:chebi> (p = 0.001) as was tolerability as assessed by patients (p = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: When compared with suboptimally titrated IM there was a trend towards a lower HbA1c with <z:chebi fb="10" ids="17345">GMP</z:chebi> and significantly more <z:chebi fb="10" ids="17345">GMP</z:chebi> subjects obtained an HbA1c under 7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Global assessments by investigators and subjects showed both a greater efficacy and tolerability with <z:chebi fb="10" ids="17345">GMP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
