<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to establish a dose of the DPP-4-inhibitor vildagliptin (LAF237) that was effective in reducing HbA1c levels and was safe and well tolerated in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study of 279 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> consisted of a 4-week run-in phase where patients received placebo and a 12-week active treatment phase where they received one of the following dosages of vildagliptin: 25 mg twice daily, 25, 50 or 100 mg once daily (qd), or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a statistically significant reduction in HbA1c levels in the vildagliptin 50 mg qd (p=0.003) and 100 mg qd groups (p=0.004) compared with the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean 4-h postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level was significantly reduced from placebo in the vildagliptin 50 mg qd group (p = 0.012) and mean 4-h postprandial insulin was significantly increased from baseline vs. placebo in the vildagliptin 100 mg qd group (p=0.022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The assessment of beta-cell function (HOMA-B) was significantly increased in the vildagliptin 100 mg qd treatment group (p=0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of adverse events was similar in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treatment groups including placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Vildagliptin, at 50 and 100 mg qd, was effective in reducing HbA1c levels compared with placebo in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Vildagliptin at dosages up to 100 mg qd appeared safe and well tolerated </plain></SENT>
