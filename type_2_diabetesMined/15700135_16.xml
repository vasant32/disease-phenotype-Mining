<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to depict the physiopathological and cellular mechanisms involved in regulation of adipocyte autotaxin expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Autotaxin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> were quantified in adipose tissue from db/db mice (<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and highly diabetic type 2), gold-thioglucose-treated (GTG) mice (highly <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and moderately diabetic type 2), high-fat diet-fed (HFD) mice (<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and moderately diabetic type 2), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi>-treated mice (thin and diabetic type 1), and massively <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> humans with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: When compared to non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> controls, autotaxin expression in db/db mice was significantly increased, but not in GTG, HFD, or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi>-treated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During db/db mice development, up-regulation of autotaxin occurred only 3 weeks after the emergence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020459" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperinsulinaemia</z:e>, and simultaneously with the emergence of hyperglycaaemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adipocytes from db/db mice exhibited a stronger impairment of insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake than non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and HFD-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Autotaxin expression was up-regulated by treatment with TNFalpha (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>-promoting cytokine), and down-regulated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> treatment (insulin-sensitising compound) in 3T3F442A adipocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, adipose tissue autotaxin expression was significantly up-regulated in patients exhibiting both <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The present work demonstrates the existence of a db/db-specific up-regulation of adipocyte autotaxin expression, which could be related to the severe type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> phenotype and adipocyte <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, rather than excess <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> in itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It also showed that type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in humans is also associated with up-regulation of adipocyte autotaxin expression </plain></SENT>
