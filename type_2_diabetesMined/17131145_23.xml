<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hyperglucagonaemia or altered insulin:glucagon ratio plays a role in maintaining <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that glucagon receptor knockout (Gcgr (-/-)) mice develop normally and have lower plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> on a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The goal of the current research was to further investigate the role of glucagon signalling in metabolic control and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Gcgr (-/-) mice were challenged with a high-fat diet (HFD) and with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi>, which induces beta cell damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They were then analysed for whole-body and serum metabolic phenotypes as well as pancreatic islet <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In comparison with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice, Gcgr (-/-) mice exhibited <z:hpo ids='HP_0004325'>decreased body weight</z:hpo> and food intake, reduced plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, and improved oral and intraperitoneal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Elevated glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 levels and reduced gastric emptying were also observed in Gcgr (-/-) mice, which also had reduced HFD-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020459" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperinsulinaemia</z:e> and hyperleptinaemia, and were resistant to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>hepatic steatosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, Gcgr (-/-) mice were resistant to STZ-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> and pancreatic beta cell destruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: This study demonstrates that blocking glucagon signalling by targeted Gcgr gene deletion leads to an improvement in metabolic control in this mouse model </plain></SENT>
