<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed whether hand-grip strength predicted incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We followed 394 nondiabetic Japanese-American subjects (mean age 51.9) for the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We fit a logistic regression model to examine the association between hand-grip strength at baseline and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk over 10 years, adjusted for age, sex, and family history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A statistically significant (p = 0.008) and negative (coefficient -0.208) association was observed between hand-grip strength and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk that diminished at higher BMI levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adjusted ORs for a 10-pound hand-grip strength increase with BMI set at the 25th, 50th or 75th percentiles were 0.68, 0.79, and 0.98, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among leaner individuals, greater hand-grip strength was associated with lower risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, suggesting it may be a useful marker of risk in this population </plain></SENT>
