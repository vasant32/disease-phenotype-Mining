<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The powerful relation between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may have a common genetic basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, few genes predisposing to both have been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Calpain-10 (CAPN10) was the first gene for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> identified by positional cloning, wherein a combination of haplotypes conferred increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine whether CAPN10 influences subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among nondiabetic subjects from 85 Mexican-American families with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was assessed by common carotid artery intima-media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>), insulin sensitivity was assessed by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, and insulin secretion was estimated by the oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These phenotypes were tested for association with CAPN10 haplotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Haplotype 1112 (of single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs] 44, 43, 56, and 63) was associated with increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>, while haplotype 1221 was associated with decreased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 112/121 haplotype combination (of SNPs 43, 56, and 63), originally found to confer increased risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, was associated with the largest <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> in our study population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CAPN10 was also associated with both insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Covariate analysis suggested that CAPN10 affects <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> independently of these <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The fact that the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> gene CAPN10 also influences the risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> shows that inherited factors may underlie the frequent co-occurrence of these two conditions </plain></SENT>
