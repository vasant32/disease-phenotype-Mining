<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Considerable data support an inherited defect in insulin secretion as one component of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Coding variants of the pancreas duodenum homeobox gene (PDX1) were proposed to predispose <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and to decrease transactivation in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that the Asp76Asn (D76N) variant that was identified in several populations predisposed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003059'>reduced insulin secretion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed a case-control study in 191 control subjects and 190 individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of European descent, then characterized the D76N variant in 704 members of 68 families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We compared the phenotypic characteristics of those with and without the variant by diagnostic status and determined the insulin secretory response to intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27999">tolbutamide</z:chebi> among nondiabetic family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: D76N was not associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, either in our population or when <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> reported studies in Caucasians were combined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>D76N did not segregate with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among the families examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among D76N carriers, nondiabetic individuals had a lower waist-to-hip ratio and a trend to lower BMI than their diabetic counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Diabetic carriers of D76N were significantly leaner by BMI (P = 0.012) and tended to be younger than diabetic individuals with the D/D genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, insulin secretion in response to oral and intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> challenge and to intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27999">tolbutamide</z:chebi> was not reduced in D76N carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The D76N variant of PDX1 does not significantly alter insulin secretion or act as a high-risk susceptibility allele for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> as proposed previously, although we cannot exclude a minor role in increasing risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
