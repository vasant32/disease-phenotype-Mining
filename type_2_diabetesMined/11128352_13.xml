<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe and contrast the personal models of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in European Americans (EAs) and Latinos and to highlight differences that require a reorientation of clinical care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 116 EAs and 76 Latino individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were interviewed about their personal model of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Responses to open-ended questions about the perceived cause, nature, seriousness, course, and future course of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and its impact on everyday life were analyzed using an iterative process, and categories of response were established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Responses were examined within ethnic group, and comparisons across ethnic groups were made for clinically significant differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Disease descriptions about the nature of the disease were categorized as experiential, biomedical, or psychosocial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Disease descriptions varied significantly by ethnicity (chi2 = 35.92, 2 df, P &lt; 0.001), with more Latinos using an experiential model and more EAs using a biomedical model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant differences in life changes caused by the disease were found, with EAs reporting changes in exercise and spontaneity and Latinos in <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> and mood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Individuals with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from both ethnic groups gave comparable assessments about the cause, seriousness, and effectiveness of treatments for the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Clinical practice that attends to the concerns and experiences of individuals with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from diverse ethnic groups is warranted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Broad assessment of personal models in diverse ethnic groups is recommended </plain></SENT>
