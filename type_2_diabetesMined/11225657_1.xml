<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The two groups were similar in age, sex distribution, and body mass index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By selection, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi>-treated patients had significantly (p &lt; 0.001) lower (mean +/- s.e.m.) fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (6.9+/-0.4 vs. 13.9+/-0.8 mmol/l) and HbA(IC) (7.4+/-0.2 vs. 11.8+/-0.9%) concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, insulin-stimulated tyrosine kinase activity was increased in erythrocytes from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi> -treated patients (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although insulin receptor number was similar in solubilized erythrocytes from the two groups, tyrosine kinase activity per insulin receptor was significantly (p &lt; 0.02) greater in erythrocytes from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi>-treated patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings are quite similar to previously published data in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>-treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As such, it is suggested that decreases in insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity may contribute to the loss of insulin sensitivity in hyperglycaemic subjects (glucotoxicity), and that an improvement in glycaemic control, irrespective of how it is achieved, will help rectify this abnormality </plain></SENT>
