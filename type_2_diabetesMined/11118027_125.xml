<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine the role of the intrauterine diabetic environment per se, the prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the mean BMI were compared in siblings born before and after their mother was recognized as having <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nuclear families in which at least one sibling was born before and one after the mother was diagnosed with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Consequently, the siblings born before and after differed in their exposure to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in utero </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 58 siblings from 19 families in which at least one sibling had <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were examined at similar ages (within 3 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was significantly higher in siblings born after the mother developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than in those born before the mother's diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (odds ratio 3.7, P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 52 families, among 183 siblings without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the mean BMI was 2.6 kg/m2 higher in offspring of diabetic than in offspring of nondiabetic pregnancies (P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, there were no significant differences in risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or BMI between offspring born before and after the father was diagnosed with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intrauterine exposure to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> per se conveys a high risk for the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in offspring in excess of risk attributable to genetic factors alone </plain></SENT>
