<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To detect and understand the changes in beta-cell function in the pathogenesis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, an accurate and precise estimation of prehepatic insulin secretion rate (ISR) is essential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are two common methods to assess ISR, the deconvolution method (by Eaton and Polonsky)-considered the "gold standard"-and the combined model (by VÃ¸lund et al.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The deconvolution method is a 2-day method, which generally requires separate assessment of C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> kinetics, whereas the combined model is a single-day method that uses insulin and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> data from a single test of interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The validity of these mathematical techniques for quantification of insulin secretion have been tested in dogs, but not in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present studies, we examined the validity of both methods to recover the known infusion rates of insulin and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> mimicking ISR during an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ISR from both the combined model and the deconvolution method were accurate, i.e., recovery of true ISR was not significantly different from 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, both maximal and total ISRs from the combined model were strongly correlated to those obtained by the deconvolution method (r = 0.89 and r = 0.82, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that both approaches provide accurate assessment of prehepatic ISRs in type 2 diabetic patients and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A simplified version of the deconvolution method based on standard kinetic parameters for C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (Van Cauter et al.) was compared with the 2-day deconvolution method, and a close agreement was found for the results of an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We also studied whether C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> kinetics are influenced by somatostatin infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The decay curves after bolus injection of exogenous biosynthetic human C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, the kinetic parameters, and the metabolic clearance rate were similar whether measured during constant peripheral somatostatin infusion or without somatostatin infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Assessment of C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> kinetics can be performed without infusion of somatostatin, because the endogenous insulin concentration remains constant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Assessment of C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> kinetics with and without infusion of somatostatin results in nearly identical secretion rates for insulin during an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test </plain></SENT>
