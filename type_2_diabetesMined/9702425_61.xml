<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare the risk for diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> in non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Mexican-American adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the U.S. population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Representative population-based samples of people aged &gt; or = 40 years in each of the three racial/ethnic groups were studied in the 1988-1994 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was ascertained by medical history interview, and undiagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by measurement of fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A fundus photograph of a single eye was taken with a nonmydriatic camera, and a standardized protocol was used to grade diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Information on risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> was obtained by interview and standard laboratory procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Prevalence of any lesions of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> in people with diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 46% higher in non-Hispanic blacks and 84% higher in Mexican Americans, compared with non-Hispanic whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Blacks and Mexican Americans also had higher rates of moderate and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> and higher levels of many putative risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Blacks had lower <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> prevalence among those with undiagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In logistic regression, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> in people with diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was associated only with measures of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> severity (duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, HbA1c, level, treatment with insulin and oral agents) and systolic blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for these factors, the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> in Mexican Americans was twice that of non-Hispanic whites, but non-Hispanic blacks were not at higher risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These risks were similar when people with undiagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were included in the logistic regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence and severity of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> is greater in non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican Americans with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the U.S. population than in non-Hispanic whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>For blacks, this can be attributed to their higher levels of risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, but the excess risk in Mexican Americans is unexplained </plain></SENT>
