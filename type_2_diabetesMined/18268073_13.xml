<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of twice- and thrice-daily biphasic insulin aspart 30 (BIAsp 30) in Chinese subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> inadequately controlled with oral antidiabetes drugs (OADs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this 24-week, multicenter, parallel-group, randomized, treat-to-target study, 321 Chinese insulin-naïve subjects with poorly controlled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &gt;or=7.8 mmol/l and A1C &gt;or=7.5%) were randomized (1:1) to twice- or thrice-daily (BID and TID groups, respectively) BIAsp 30 without OADs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Initial insulin doses were based on fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> at randomization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Insulin dose was adjusted with algorithm-controlled titration to achieve premeal blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> of 4.4-6.1 mmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A1C decreased significantly in both groups (BID group -2.48 +/- 0.07%; TID group -2.81 +/- 0.07%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thrice-daily BIAsp 30 showed superiority in A1C improvement (-0.33% [95% CI -0.53 to -0.13]; P &lt; 0.01) and helped more subjects achieve A1C targets &lt;7% (BID group 51.3% vs. TID group 65.8%; P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thrice-daily BIAsp 30 was more effective in subjects with baseline A1C &gt;or=9% (&lt;7%: BID group 41.5% vs. TID group 58.3%; P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in rates of overall and nocturnal major and minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> per subject year between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> (BID group 3.87 +/- 0.28 kg; TID group 4.09 +/- 0.27 kg) and mean daily insulin doses (BID group 0.82 +/- 0.28 units/kg; TID group 0.86 +/- 0.34 units/kg) were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Twice- and thrice-daily BIAsp 30 were effective in Chinese insulin-naïve subjects with poorly controlled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thrice-daily BIAsp 30 offered greater reduction in A1C without increasing risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>, insulin dose, and <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>, especially in subjects with A1C &gt;or=9% </plain></SENT>
