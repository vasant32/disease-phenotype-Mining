<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: The therapeutic efficacy of oral hypoglycaemic drugs varies between individuals, and pharmacogenetic factors contribute to this variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Gly972Arg polymorphism in the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) has been shown to play a role in insulin signal transduction and therapeutic failure to sulphonylurea drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied the association between the IRS-1 polymorphism and the <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA1c) level in diabetic patients treated with insulinotropic versus non-insulinotropic hypoglycaemic drugs as a marker for the efficacy of an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genotyping of the IRS-1 Arg(972) variant was performed in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients treated with either sulphonylurea drugs, glinides or insulin or with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">glitazones</z:chebi> using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significantly higher HbA1c levels were observed in carriers of the Arg(972) variant after treatment with insulinotropic drugs compared to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> carriers (8.3 vs. 7.6%, p = 0.005, independent t-test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, patients with secondary failure to insulinotropic hypoglycaemic drugs switching finally to insulin showed even higher HbA1c levels in carriers of Arg(972) compared to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (8.7 vs. 7.6%, p = 0.005, independent t-test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Thus, we were able to replicate the earlier findings of an association between the IRS-1 Arg(972) variant and secondary failure to sulphonylurea drugs, and further observed a general association between HbA1c and this polymorphism in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients treated with insulinotropic hypoglycaemic drugs but not with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
