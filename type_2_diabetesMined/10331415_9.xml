<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied the effect of moxonidine, an <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53094">imidazoline</z:chebi> ligand, on metabolic and hemodynamic parameters in <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> diabetic fatty rats, a model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In one group (metabolic group), 8-week-old rats were started on a diet containing either moxonidine (3 or 10 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)) or vehicle for 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Body weight and food intake were monitored daily, plasma insulin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> were monitored weekly, and an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) was performed at study's end </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In another group of rats (hemodynamic group), radio frequency transmitters were implanted 1 week before starting the diet, and mean blood pressure, heart rate, and motor activity were continuously monitored at baseline and for 4 weeks after beginning drug exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moxonidine (10 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)) significantly decreased elevated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels and prevented the decrease in plasma insulin noted in vehicle-treated or pair-fed groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moxonidine also decreased fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (3 and 10 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)) and prevented the decrease in fasting insulin (10 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)) compared with vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> at 10 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) was equivalent to lean littermates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both doses significantly increased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal and the insulin secretory response during the OGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moxonidine lowered daily mean arterial pressure compared with both baseline values and vehicle and decreased daily heart rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Motor activity was unaffected, except for an increase in the 10 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) group during low activity periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moxonidine did not significantly affect body weight, fluid intake, or urine volume, but the 10 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) dose reduced urinary protein excretion compared with vehicle-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that, in an animal model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive agent</z:chebi> moxonidine induces a beneficial effect on abnormal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism and renal protein excretion at doses that are effective in lowering arterial blood pressures and heart rate </plain></SENT>
