<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about whether iron consumption affects <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> (CHD) risk in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We prospectively assessed the associations of long-term intakes of dietary iron and red meat with CHD risk among 6,161 women who reported a diagnosis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During 54,455 person-years of follow-up from 1980 through 2000, we documented 550 incident cases of CHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for age and BMI, high intakes of both <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> iron and red meat were associated with a significantly increased risk of fatal CHD (P for trend = 0.003 and 0.018), coronary revascularization (P for trend = 0.02 and 0.06), and total CHD (P for trend = 0.0009 and 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Women with the highest intake of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> iron had 50% (6-94%) increased risk of total CHD compared with those with the lowest intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further adjustment for other lifestyle and dietary factors did not appreciably change the associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The positive association between <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> iron and red meat intakes and CHD was more evident among postmenopausal women compared with premenopausal women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that higher consumption of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> iron and red meat may increase CHD risk among women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
