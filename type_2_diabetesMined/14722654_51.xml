<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Insulin acts by binding to its cell surface receptor, thus activating the receptor's intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, resulting in receptor autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of several substrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Tyrosine phosphorylated residues on the receptor itself and on subsequently bound receptor substrates provide docking sites for downstream signalling molecules, including adapters, protein serine/threonine kinases, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16749">phosphoinositide</z:chebi> kinases and exchange factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Collectively, those molecules orchestrate the numerous insulin-mediated physiological responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A clear picture is emerging of the way in which insulin elicits several intracellular signalling pathways to mediate its physiologic functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A further challenge, being pursued by several laboratories, is to understand the molecular mechanisms that underlie insulin action at the peripheral level, deregulation of which ultimately leads to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> and Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We review how circulating factors such as insulin itself, TNF-alpha, interleukins, fatty acids and glycation products influence insulin action through insulin signalling molecules themselves or through other pathways ultimately impinging on the insulin-signalling pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Understanding how the mechanism by which molecular insulin action is modulated by these factors will potentially provide new targets for pharmacological agents, to enable the control of altered <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
