<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, too few people are on insulin, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> too commonly have poor glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This paradigm significantly increases the risk for long-term complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is becoming increasingly apparent that the early introduction of basal insulin, such as insulin glargine, is essential to provide clinically important improvements in glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this review, we discuss the rationale for the earlier insulinization in T2DM in order to reach and maintain treatment targets and to provide further support for the recent American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association and European Association for the Study of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> consensus statement </plain></SENT>
