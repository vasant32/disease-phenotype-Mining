<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: We sought to establish the relationship between plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> A-V (APOA5, previously known as apoA-V) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels and to determine the impact of the APOA5 genotype on APOA5 levels and development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a 15-year follow-up study of healthy UK men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: APOA5 -1131T&gt;C and S19W genotypes were determined in 2,490 men, of whom 145 subsequently developed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a subset of 299 men, we also determined APOA5 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Plasma APOA5 levels positively correlated with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (r=0.18, p&lt;0.002) and were not different in men who subsequently developed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with healthy men (p=0.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Carriers of either APOA5 W19 or -1131C had, as expected, higher plasma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, while W19 carriers had significantly higher APOA5 levels (p=0.0003), APOA5 levels were not associated with -1131T&gt;C (p=0.63), reinforcing the idea that the reported -1131C association with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> levels is due to linkage disequilibrium with variants in the APOC3 gene, and not due to the direct effect on APOA5 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall no effect of APOA5 -1131T&gt;C or S19W was found on type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In contrast to animal studies, in man, plasma APOA5 positively correlates with plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In prospective analysis, with the caveat that numbers were small, APOA5 genotypes do not appear to have an impact on risk of development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
