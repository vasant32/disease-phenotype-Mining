<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to evaluate the association between micro and macrovascular complications of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and anticardiolipin and anti-beta2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-six patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> as a macrovascular complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five age and sex matched healthy subjects formed a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Anticardiolipin IgM, IgG, anti-beta2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> IgM and IgG antibody levels were studied in both patient and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Diabetic patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischaemic heart disease</z:e> had significantly higher titres of anticardiolipin IgG antibody than patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischaemic heart disease</z:e> (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, none of these patients had an anticardiolipin IgG antibody level higher than 20 GPL, which is accepted as a clinically significant value, so this association may not be clinically important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no association with the microvascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was also no significant association between anti-beta2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I antibodies in type 2 diabetic patients and micro and macrovascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Anticardiolipin and anti-beta2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I antibodies do not have a major role in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Prospective studies of large populations are needed to explore this association further </plain></SENT>
