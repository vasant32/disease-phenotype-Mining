<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed 24-h dietary recall data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003-2006 to estimate SSB consumption levels among 1,090 adults (aged ≥ 20 years) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> overall and by diagnosis and control status of their <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 2003-2006, 45% of adults with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> consumed SSBs on a given day, obtaining an average of 202 calories and 47 g of sugar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Undiagnosed adults with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were significantly more likely to consume SSBs than diagnosed adults (60 vs. 38% diagnosed/uncontrolled [P &lt; 0.001] and 43% diagnosed/controlled [P = 0.001]) and were less likely to consume diet beverages (18 vs. 50% diagnosed/uncontrolled [P &lt; 0.001] and 40% diagnosed/controlled [P &lt; 0.001]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Men consumed significantly more SSBs than women (P = 0.027), younger adults (aged 20-44) more than older adults (45-64 and ≥ 65; P &lt; 0.001), non-Hispanic black more than whites (P = 0.010); and low-income individuals (quartile 1) more than higher-income individuals (quartile 3, P = 0.040; quartile 4, P = 0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For most demographic and body weight categories, adults who were undiagnosed consumed more sugar from SSBs than adults who were diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SSB consumption is high among adults with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, particularly among those who are undiagnosed </plain></SENT>
