<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM/HYPOTHESIS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> is a global problem with high risks of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is well known that maternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> affects offspring by inducing malformation, functional abnormalities in many organs and cells, and by increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about abnormalities induced by maternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in pancreatic beta cells of offspring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used mouse mothers with the Agouti yellow modification on a C57BL/6 background as a maternal model of normoglycaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and produced Agouti-negative offspring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Half of the offspring were fed a high-fat diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Offspring <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance was tested at different ages, and animals were killed at 50 weeks of age for islet function analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Maternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> in female offspring fed a high-fat diet, and significantly <z:mp ids='MP_0003059'>reduced insulin secretion</z:mp> at 50 weeks of age in female offspring that had been fed a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> diet and high-fat diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Insulin secretion and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> potentiation from these islets were significantly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Islet protein, DNA and insulin contents were increased while <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17138">glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase and transketolase activities were reduced in female offspring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our results indicate that maternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> has a long-term effect on the beta cells of female, but not of male, offspring, and leads to increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the offspring's later lives </plain></SENT>
