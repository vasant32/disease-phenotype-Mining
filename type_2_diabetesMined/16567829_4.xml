<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 364 Japanese subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> without overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> were enrolled during 1996-1998 and followed until 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (-1504C/T, -546C/G, -348A/G, -278C/T, and -238C/G) in the promoter region of PRKCB1 were genotyped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The end points were transition from stage to stage of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> as a time-to-event outcome and the annual decline rate of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) as a slope-based outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the study (median 6 years), 34 of 364 subjects (9.3%) progressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier estimation revealed that subjects with both T allele at -1054 C/T and G allele at -546 C/G polymorphisms frequently showed transition to advanced stages of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> (P = 0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The annual change rate in eGFR in the subjects with both alleles was also significantly higher than in others (-2.96 +/- 0.62 vs. -1.63 +/- 0.15 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)/year, P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The estimated frequency of this risk T-G haplotype was significantly higher in the progressors who showed transition to advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> stages (12%) than in the nonprogressors (5%) (odds ratio 2.3 [95% CI 1.0-5.2]), and it was also higher in those with accelerated decline of the Delta eGFR (&gt; or =3 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)/year) than in those without (2.1 [1.1-3.9]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that PRKCB1 is a predictor for worsening of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> in Japanese subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
