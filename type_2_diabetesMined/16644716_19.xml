<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The three polymorphisms -1082G/A, -819C/T, and -592C/A in the IL10 promoter were reported to influence IL10 transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether these polymorphisms were associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and related traits in a cohort of Italian Caucasians comprising 551 type 2 diabetic and 1,131 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The -819C/T and -592C/A polymorphisms were in perfect linkage disequilibrium (r(2) = 1.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The -1082G/A polymorphism was not associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or related traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the -592C/A polymorphism was not associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, nondiabetic homozygous carriers of the A allele showed <z:mp ids='MP_0006087'>increased BMI</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and lower plasma IL-10 levels compared with the other genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the nondiabetic group, the ATA haplotype was associated with an increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (odds ratio 1.28 [95% CI 1.02-1.60]; P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ATA/ATA composite genotype was associated with an increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (1.96 [1.16-3.31]; P = 0.01) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (1.99 [1.12-3.53]; P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that polymorphisms and haplotypes of the IL10 promoter may be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in a large sample of Italian Caucasians </plain></SENT>
