<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subjects were selected from participants in an ongoing study of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and its complications in the Gila River Indian Community of Arizona </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects' exposure to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in utero was established from periodic examinations conducted as part of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of elevated urinary albumin excretion (UAE) (albumin-to-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio &gt; or = 30 mg/g) was 40% (83 of 207) in the offspring of nondiabetic mothers, 43% (105 of 246) in the offspring of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetic</z:e> mothers (i.e., women who were not diabetic at the time of the pregnancy but who developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after the pregnancy), and 58% (29 of 50) in the offspring of mothers who had <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After controlling for age, sex, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, HbA1c, and mean arterial pressure in the offspring in a logistic regression analysis using generalized estimating equations, <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>maternal diabetes</z:hpo> during pregnancy was strongly associated with elevated UAE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The odds of elevated UAE in the offspring of mothers who had <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during pregnancy was 3.8 times (95% CI 1.7-8.4) that of the offspring of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetic</z:e> mothers; the odds of elevated UAE in the offspring of nondiabetic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetic</z:e> mothers were similar (odds ratio of 0.94; 95% CI 0.59-1.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We concluded that exposure to a diabetic intrauterine environment increases the risk of elevated UAE in diabetic Pima Indians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The effect of this exposure appears to be independent of other susceptibility factors that lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
