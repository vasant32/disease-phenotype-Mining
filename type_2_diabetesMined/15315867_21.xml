<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, intensive therapy with insulin and some oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> agents come at the price of <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>, a condition that can prevent attainment of tight glycemic goals and probably limits success of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Insulin-related <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> has been attributed to anabolic effects of insulin, appetite increases, and reduction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003076'>glycosuria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For lasting weight control, such interventions may need to continue throughout the course of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Likewise, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight-loss</z:hpo> agents, such as sibutramine and orlistat promote short-term <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, but no follow-up studies have yet demonstrated that this loss can be maintained for 5 years or longer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bariatric surgery is the only treatment recognized to have lasting effects on weight control, but its use is limited at present to those who are morbidly <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
