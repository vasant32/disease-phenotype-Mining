<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS, MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was based on 5,470 men and 5,422 women (aged 25-74 years) without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who participated in one of the three population-based MONICA Augsburg surveys between 1984 and 1995 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Incident cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were assessed using follow-up questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated from Cox proportional hazard models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Up to 31 December 2002 a total of 409 cases of incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among men and 263 among women were registered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of cigarettes and the <z:chebi fb="164" ids="18723">nicotine</z:chebi> and tar consumption per day were associated with a significantly increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among men, but not among women; this could be due to the low power of the study in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After multivariable adjustment, the HRs for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with never-smokers were 1.48, 2.03 and 2.10 for men smoking 1 to 14, 15 to 19 and &gt; or =20 cigarettes/day (p for trend &lt;0.0001) and 1.25, 1.34 and 1.37 for women smoking 1 to 9, 10 to 19 and &gt; or =20 cigarettes/day (p for trend 0.0985) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with never-smokers, the HRs for increasing tar intake in men (1-167, 168-259 and &gt; or =260 mg/day) were 1.45, 2.32 and 2.07 (p for trend &lt;0.0001); the respective HRs in women (1-89, 90-194 and &gt; or =195 mg/day) were 1.18, 1.57 and 1.24 (p for trend 0.1159) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Cigarette smoking is an important modifiable risk factor of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> particularly in men from the general population </plain></SENT>
