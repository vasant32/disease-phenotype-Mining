<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We studied the effects of the age and/or disease duration in diabetics on the progression of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (DR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The population consisted of 3614 type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The subjects were divided into three age groups (elderly, &gt; or = 65 years old; middle-aged, 64-40 years old, and younger &lt; 40 years old) for disease duration-adjusted comparison with and without DR and proliferative diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDR</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Then, in 503 patients with 8-year follow-up data available, the frequency of development/progression of DR and the rate of progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDR</z:e> were compared among the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirdly, in the elderly patients, DR prevalence and the frequency of the development/progression of DR were compared between two groups with different <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration (&gt; or = 6 years and &lt; or = 5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of DR increased significantly with age (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDR</z:e> decreased significantly with age (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall frequency of the development and/or progression of DR increased significantly with age (P = 0.002); however, age was not related to the frequency of progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDR</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration of 6-15 years, the frequency of the development/progression of DR and of progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDR</z:e> after an 8-year follow up tended to decrease with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Elderly patients with a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration of &gt; or = 6 years showed significantly higher rate of prevalence of DR and frequency of development/progression of DR in an 8-year period than those with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> of a shorter duration (P &lt; 0.001 and P &lt; 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In elderly DM patients, the prevalence of DR was increased even in the short duration and development/progression rates of DR were increased, while the relative frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDR</z:e> was decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Older-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> DM patients appear to be at a lower risk for progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDR</z:e> </plain></SENT>
