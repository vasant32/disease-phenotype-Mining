<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Subclinical <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> is linked with the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and epidemiologic data suggest that this association may be stronger in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although small clinical studies have shown a prominent hypoglycemic effect of short-term high-dose aspirin, no randomized trials have directly evaluated the efficacy of aspirin in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention at doses acceptable for use in routine clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> low-dose aspirin prevents the development of clinical <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among initially healthy American women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Subjects were enrolled in the Women's Health Study, a 10-year randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of aspirin and vitamin E for primary prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Between 1992 and 1995, 38,716 women aged &gt; or =45 years and free of clinical <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were randomly assigned to either low-dose aspirin or placebo (median follow-up 10.2 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Documented clinical type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was prospectively evaluated throughout the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among women randomly assigned to receive aspirin (n = 19,326) or placebo (n = 19,390), there was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 849 cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the aspirin group and 847 in the placebo group (rate ratio 1.01 [95% CI 0.91-1.11]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Stratification by <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk factors including age, BMI, family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, physical activity, A1C, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein did not support a modulating effect of these variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Analyses accounting for treatment duration and adherence similarly found no beneficial effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that long-term low-dose aspirin does not prevent the development of clinical type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in initially healthy women </plain></SENT>
