<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">Sulfonylureas</z:chebi> are widely used to treat type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> because they stimulate insulin secretion from pancreatic beta-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They primarily act by binding to the SUR subunit of the ATP-sensitive <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> (K(ATP)) channel and inducing channel closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the channel is still able to open to a limited extent when the drug is bound, so that high-affinity <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> inhibition is not complete, even at saturating drug concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>K(ATP) channels are also found in cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle, but in these tissues are composed of different SUR subunits that confer different drug sensitivities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27999">tolbutamide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi> block channels containing SUR1 (beta-cell type), but not SUR2 (cardiac, smooth muscle types), whereas <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi>, repaglinide, and meglitinide block both types of channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This difference has been exploited to determine residues contributing to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi>-binding site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">Sulfonylurea</z:chebi> block is decreased by mutations or agents (e.g., <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37328">phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate</z:chebi>) that increase K(ATP) channel open probability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We now propose a kinetic model that explains this effect in terms of changes in the channel open probability and in the transduction between the drug-binding site and the channel gate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also clarify the mechanism by which MgADP produces an apparent increase of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> efficacy on channels containing SUR1 (but not SUR2) </plain></SENT>
