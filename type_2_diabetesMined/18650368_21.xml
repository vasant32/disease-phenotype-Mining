<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, YKL-40 was examined in relation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Plasma YKL-40 and adipose tissue YKL-40 mRNA levels were investigated in 199 subjects who were divided into four groups depending on the presence or absence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, plasma YKL-40 was examined in healthy subjects during a hyperglycemic clamp, in which the plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level was kept at 15 mmol/l for 3 h, and during a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had higher plasma YKL-40 (76.7 vs. 45.1 ng/ml, P = 0.0001) but not higher expression in adipose tissue YKL-40 mRNA (1.20 vs. 0.98, P = 0.2) compared with subjects with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Within the groups with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> subgroups showed no difference with respect to either plasma YKL-40 or adipose tissue YKL-40 mRNA levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate regression analysis showed that plasma YKL-40 was associated with fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (beta = 0.5, P = 0.0014) and plasma interleukin (IL)-6 (beta = 0.2, P = 0.0303) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasma YKL-40 was not related to parameters of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no changes in plasma YKL-40 in healthy subjects during either hyperglycemic or hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Plasma YKL-40 was identified as an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-independent marker of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> related to fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and plasma IL-6 levels </plain></SENT>
