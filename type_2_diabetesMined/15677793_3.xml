<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to investigate the influence of physiologically elevated NEFA levels on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion in order to find evidence that NEFAs are a potential factor predisposing for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disorders</z:e>, which are known risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We combined an orally administered fat emulsion with an intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test and measured the time course of NEFA, insulin, and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to find pathological conditions we applied the experiment to healthy and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The main findings are a significant increase in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion after oral fat load in both groups compared with the condition without preceding fat ingestion and a prolonged insulin secretion after fat load in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients compared with control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results provide evidence that fat ingestion modulates beta-cell function and that NEFA is a plausible mediator that acts as a link between fat and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism by modulating <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Under the condition of elevated plasma levels of NEFA, this mechanism may be responsible for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients and a potential target of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention strategies </plain></SENT>
