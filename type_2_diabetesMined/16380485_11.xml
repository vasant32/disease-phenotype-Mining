<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The insulin-degrading enzyme is responsible for the intracellular proteolysis of insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its gene IDE is located on chromosome 10, in an area with suggestive linkage to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and related phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Due to the impact of genetic variants of this gene in rodents and the function of its protein product, it has been proposed as a candidate gene for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Various groups have explored the role of the common genetic variation of IDE on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and reported associations of various single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes on both type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and glycemic traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We sought to characterize the haplotype structure of IDE in detail and replicate the association of common variants with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, fasting insulin, fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We assessed linkage disequilibrium, selected single-marker and multimarker tags, and genotyped these markers in several case-control and family-based samples totalling 4,206 Caucasian individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We observed no statistically significant evidence of association between single-marker or multimarker tests in IDE and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nominally significant differences in quantitative traits are consistent with statistical noise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that common genetic variation at IDE is unlikely to confer clinically significant risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Caucasians </plain></SENT>
