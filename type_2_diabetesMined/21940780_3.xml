<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The molecular mechanisms responsible for pancreatic β-cell dysfunction in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> remain unresolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Increased expression of the helix-loop-helix protein Id1 has been found in islets of diabetic mice and in vitro models of β-cell dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigated the role of Id1 in insulin secretion and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Id1 knockout (Id1(-/-)) and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice were fed a chow or high-fat diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, insulin tolerance, β-cell mass, insulin secretion, and islet gene expression were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (siRNA) was used to silence Id1 in MIN6 cells, and responses to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> treatment were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Id1(-/-) mice exhibited an improved response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> challenge and were almost completely protected against <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> induced by high-fat diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This was associated with increased insulin levels and enhanced insulin release from isolated islets, whereas energy intake, body weight, fat pad weight, β-cell mass, and insulin action were unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Islets from Id1(-/-) mice displayed reduced stress gene expression and were protected against high-fat diet-induced downregulation of β-cell gene expression (pancreatic duodenal homeobox-1, Beta2, Glut2, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> carboxylase, and Gpr40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In MIN6 cells, siRNA-mediated inhibition of Id1 enhanced insulin secretion after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> treatment and protected against <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi>-mediated loss of β-cell gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings implicate Id1 as a negative regulator of insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Id1 expression plays an essential role in the etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo>, insulin secretory dysfunction, and β-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002793" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">dedifferentiation</z:e> under conditions of increased <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> supply </plain></SENT>
