<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35381">monosaccharides</z:chebi> resulting from the digestion of ingested carbohydrates are <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28757">fructose</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="28260">galactose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of these three <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35381">monosaccharides</z:chebi>, only ingested <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> resulted in a large increase in the plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="15" ids="28757">Fructose</z:chebi> (Metabolism 41:510-517, 1992) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="28260">galactose</z:chebi> (Metabolism 42:1560-1567, 1993) had only a minor effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we were interested in determining whether we could design a mixed meal, using foods of known <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35381">monosaccharide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36233">disaccharide</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">starch</z:chebi> composition, the ingestion of which would result in only a small rise in plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The experimental meal was composed of very little readily digestible <z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">starch</z:chebi> but rather large amounts of fruits and vegetables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It contained 43% carbohydrate, 22% protein, and 34% fat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results were compared with a second type of meal that contained 55% carbohydrate, 15% protein, and 30% fat, with an emphasis on complex carbohydrates (<z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">starch</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It also was compared with a third meal that contained 40% carbohydrate, 20% protein, and 40% fat, typical of that consumed by the average American </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The test meals were ingested in random order by people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were not treated with oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi> or insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Each subject ingested each type of meal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The same identical meal was ingested at 0800, 1200, and 1700 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The integrated 24-h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> area response was statistically significantly smaller (P &lt; 0.05) after ingestion of the low-<z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">starch</z:chebi> meals compared with the high-<z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">starch</z:chebi>, high-carbohydrate meals or the typical American meals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The 24-h integrated serum insulin area response also was statistically significantly less (P &lt; 0.05) after ingestion of the low-<z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">starch</z:chebi> meals compared with the high-<z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">starch</z:chebi> meals or the typical American meals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> area response was similar after ingestion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three test diets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A diet in which fruits, nonstarch vegetables, and dairy products are emphasized may be useful for people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
