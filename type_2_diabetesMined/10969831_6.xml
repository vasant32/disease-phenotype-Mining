<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (IAPP or amylin) is a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> secretory product of the pancreatic beta-cell that is cosecreted with insulin and is the major constituent of islet amyloid deposits in individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021670" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">insulinomas</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously reported that <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> stimulates IAPP, but not insulin secretion, from neonatal rat beta-cells when regulated secretion is prevented by use of calcium-free media, suggesting that IAPP secretion occurs via a constitutive secretory pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To directly test this hypothesis, we examined the effects of 2 substances-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="48080">brefeldin A</z:chebi> (BFA) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27641">cycloheximide</z:chebi> (CHX)-that are predicted to selectively block constitutive secretion on the release of IAPP-like immunoreactivity (IAPP-LI) and immunoreactive insulin (IRI) from neonatal rat islet cell monolayer cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When regulated release was prevented by use of calcium-free media, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated IAPP-LI release was nearly abolished by blocking constitutive release with 10 microg/ml BFA (mean +/- SD: 8.7 +/- 7.7 vs. 29.3 +/- 14.3 pmol/l; n = 5; P &lt; 0.05), an inhibitor of constitutive vesicle formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similarly, calcium-independent, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated IAPP-LI secretion was markedly suppressed when new protein synthesis was blocked by administration of 20 microg/ml CHX (4.6 +/- 2.1 vs. 29.5 +/- 14.0 pmol/l; n = 5; P &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Secretion of IRI was low in the absence of calcium, and neither BFA nor CHX had any further effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When calcium was added to the incubation media to allow regulated secretion of both IRI and IAPP-LI, both BFA (47.7 micro 8.7 vs. 80.7 micro 10.3 pmol/l; P &lt; 0.001) and CHX (37.3 +/- 5.8 vs. 73.3 +/- 6.2 pmol/l; n = 5; P &lt; 0.0001) inhibited <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated IAPP-LI secretion by approximately 40%, but again had no inhibitory effect on IRI secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that approximately 40% of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated IAPP-LI release occurs via a constitutive secretory pathway in neonatal rat islet cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By contrast, in adult rat islets, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated IAPP-LI release was almost abolished in the absence of calcium (86 +/- 3% inhibition; P &lt; 0.05) and unaffected by addition of BFA (275 +/- 28 vs. 205 +/- 89 pmol/l; NS) or CHX (160 +/- 20 vs. 205 +/- 89 pmol/l; NS), suggesting that constitutive secretion of IAPP does not occur in mature beta-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these data suggest that a significant proportion of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated IAPP secretion from neonatal, but not adult, rat islet cells occurs via a constitutive secretory pathway </plain></SENT>
