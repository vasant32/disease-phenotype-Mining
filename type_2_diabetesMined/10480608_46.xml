<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared discrimination of commonly used in vivo tests of beta-cell function across a range of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance in seven subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (NGT), eight subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT), and nine subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In random order, each subject underwent two of each of the following tests: 1) frequently sampled 0.3-g/kg intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (FSIVGTT) with MinMod analysis; 2) homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) from three samples at 5-min intervals with a model incorporating immunoreactive or specific insulin measurements; and 3) continuous infusion of 180 mg x min(-1) x m(-2) <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> with model assessment (CIGMA) of three samples at 50, 55, and 60 min (1-h CIGMA) and at 110, 115, and 120 min (2-h CIGMA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The discrimination of each test was assessed by the ratio of the within-subject SD to the underlying between-subject SD, the discriminant ratio (DR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The degree to which tests measured the same physiological variable was assessed using Pearson's correlation coefficient adjusted for attenuation due to test imprecision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An unbiased line of equivalence, taking into account the imprecision of both tests, was used to compare results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Beta-cell function assessed from HOMA and beta-cell function assessed from CIGMA (CIGMA%beta) (using immunoreactive insulin) had higher DRs than first-phase intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test-derived incremental insulin peak, area, insulin-to-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> index, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> from FSIVGTT-MinMod </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CIGMA%beta (immunoreactive insulin) had the highest DR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FSIVGTT-derived first-phase insulin response tests correlated only moderately with HOMA and CIGMA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Using specific rather than immunoreactive insulin for HOMA and CIGMA did not improve discriminatory power </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Simple tests such as HOMA and CIGMA, using immunoreactive insulin, offer better beta-cell function discrimination across subjects with NGT, IGT, and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than measurements derived from FSIVGTT first-phase insulin response </plain></SENT>
