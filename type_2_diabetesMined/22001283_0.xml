<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This leads to the generation of neo-antigenic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> having implication in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, human placental DNA was glycated with <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28757">fructose</z:chebi> and its binding was probed with the serum antibodies from type 1 and 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Glycation was carried out by incubating DNA (10 μg/ml) with <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28757">fructose</z:chebi> (25 mM) for 5 days at 37°C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The induced structural changes in DNA were studied by spectroscopic techniques, thermal denaturation studies and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, binding characteristics of autoantibodies in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (type 1 and 2) patients were assessed by direct binding and competitive ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: DNA glycation with <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28757">fructose</z:chebi> resulted in single strand breaks, hyperchromicity in UV spectrum and increased fluorescence intensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thermal denaturation studies demonstrated the unstacking of bases and early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of duplex unwinding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients exhibited enhanced binding with glycated DNA as compared to native form, while for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> only those with secondary complications (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>Nephropathy</z:hpo>) showed higher binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Glycation of DNA has resulted in structural perturbation causing generation of neo-antigenic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> that are better antigens for antibodies in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
