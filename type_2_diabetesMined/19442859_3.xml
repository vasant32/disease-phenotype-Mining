<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A nationally representative sample of 15,236 Chinese adults aged 35-74 years was selected by 4-stage random stratified sampling in 2000-2001 for present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of T2DM in Chinese adults aged 35-74 years was 5.49% (it was 2.51% in China, 1994) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The odds ratios (ORs) (95% confidence interval [CI]) for developing T2DM were 2.14 (1.08-4.22) for family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 3.90 (1.39-10.94) for waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) (0.83-0.91 vs. &lt;0.83), 4.82 (1.43-16.28) for WHR (&gt;or=0.92 vs. &lt;0.83), and 3.14 (1.42-6.92) for <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (TG) level (&gt;or=200mg/dl vs. &lt;150 mg/dl) among men but 2.74 (1.14-6.62) for family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 1.92 (1.04-3.56) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, 3.37 (1.67-6.77) for TG level (150-199 mg/dl vs. &lt;150 mg/dl), and 3.79 (1.62-8.91) for TG level (&gt;or=200mg/dl vs. &lt;150mg/dl) among women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of T2DM in Chinese adults has increased as compared with previous data for China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An effective intervention program regarding T2DM should focus on lifestyle modification and weight reduction </plain></SENT>
