<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy, safety and clinical profile of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> in patients whose type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were poorly controlled with alpha-glucosidase inhibitor alone or alpha-glucosidase in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (30 mg q.d.) orally for 16 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were significant reductions in HbA1C, FPG and postprandial plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> at week 16 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As adverse events, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e>-like reaction, increases in LDH, CPK, etc. were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no significant change in TNF-alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Leptin levels increased significantly at week 16 and were still increasing 4 weeks after the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Per cent body fat was almost constant throughout the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When efficacy was classified by demographic variables, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> was found to be more effective in the subjects who had a higher postprandial 2-h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level, leptin level or per cent body fat value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">Pioglitazone</z:chebi> was considered to be effective when used in patients whose type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were poorly controlled with alpha-glucosidase inhibitor alone or alpha-glucosidase in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
