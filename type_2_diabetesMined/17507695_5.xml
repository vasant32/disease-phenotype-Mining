<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A prospective, comparative observational study was conducted on a series of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who presented at the retina clinic of a tertiary care center in India </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 210 eyes of 105 patients were allocated to one of three ophthalmologists, who performed dilated indirect and direct ophthalmoscopy and subsequently assessed the digital images of the same group of patients who were masked to the patient's identity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The interobserver and intertest agreement between clinical assessments and grading of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> using the software was estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Moderate nonproliferative diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (NPDR) was most frequently diagnosed, both clinically and on evaluating digital images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall agreement between the clinical grading of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> and the grading of images was 81.3% (kappa = 0.69, SE 0.04, P &lt; 0.0001); there was good agreement (81.3%) for NPDR (kappa = 0.61, SE 0.05, P &lt; 0.0001), but agreement was not as good (54.6%) for proliferative diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (kappa = 0.29, SE 0.11, P = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinically significant macular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> was diagnosed in 33.3% (70 of 210) of eyes clinically and in 40.2% (84 of 209) of eyes by grading images, and there was good agreement (89.5%) between the two (kappa = 0.77, SE 0.07, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Aravind Diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>Retinopathy</z:hpo> Screening 3.0 is a simple and valid tool to assist in the detection of sight-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> and could supplement dilated fundus examinations by ophthalmologists on patients to detect diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
