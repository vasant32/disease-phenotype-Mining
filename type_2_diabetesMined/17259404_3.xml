<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lower plasma levels of adiponectin were associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Candidate regions on chromosomes 1 ( approximately 70 cM) and 14 ( approximately 30 cM) were evaluated for replication of suggestive linkage results for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>/impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis in an independent sample of Japanese Americans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Replication of independent linkage evidence for serum levels of adiponectin on chromosome 14 was also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We investigated 529 subjects from 175 sibships who were originally part of the Honolulu Heart Program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analyses included nonparametric linkage and association using SAGE (Statistical Analysis for Genetic Epidemiology) and FBAT (family-based test of association) programs and Monte Carlo simulation of Fisher's exact test in SAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>/impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism, nominal linkage evidence (P &lt; 0.02) followed-up by genotypic association (P = 0.016) was found with marker D14S297 at 31.8 cM; linkage analyses using only <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> phenotype were also nominally significant at this marker (P &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nominal evidence for genotypic association to adiponectin serum level phenotype (P = 0.04) was found with the marker D14S1032 at 23.2 cM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present study was limited by relatively small sample size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, these results corroborate earlier studies, suggesting that further research is warranted in the candidate region approximately 30 cM on chromosome 14 </plain></SENT>
