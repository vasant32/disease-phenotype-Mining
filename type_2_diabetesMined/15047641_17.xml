<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the Reduction of Endpoints in <z:mp ids='MP_0002057'>NIDDM</z:mp> with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">Angiotensin II</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">Antagonist</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">Losartan</z:chebi> (RENAAL) study, approximately 17% of patients were Asians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this subgroup analysis, we examined the characteristics, response, and adherence to treatment of the Asian population, as well as their baseline predictors of risk of renal end points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 252 Asian patients were enrolled in the RENAAL study, which compared <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> (50 mg titrated to 100 mg) to placebo in addition to conventional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> medications in type 2 diabetic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 3.2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> therapy on renal and cardiovascular outcomes was examined, and baseline predictors of risk were determined using a Cox proportional hazards model with prespecified baseline covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">Losartan</z:chebi> reduced the risk of the primary composite end point composed of a doubling of serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal disease</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality in Asian patients by 35% (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No difference between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> and placebo was observed for the cardiovascular composite outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">Losartan</z:chebi> reduced the level of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> by 47% (P &lt; 0.001) and rate of decrease in renal function by 31% (0.0074) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Discontinuations were lower in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi>-treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The strongest baseline predictors of risk of renal end points were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> (hazard ratio 1.42, P &lt; 0.0001) and low Hb (0.81, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this subgroup analysis of the RENAAL study, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> conferred significant renal benefits and was well tolerated in Asian patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Baseline <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> and low Hb were strong predictors of risk of renal outcomes </plain></SENT>
