<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we investigated the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms in PPARGC1A on body composition and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance and on insulin sensitivity and secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Non-diabetic offspring (n=156, age 34.9+/-0.5 years [mean+/-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>], BMI 26.2+/-0.4 kg/m2) underwent an OGTT and an IVGTT and the hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The promoter and coding regions of PPARGC1A were sequenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two haplotype blocks in PPARGC1A were observed, one in the promoter region (G-1774A, A-1679G, T-1422C, A-1278G, C-543A) and one in the coding region and 3' regions (Thr394Thr, Asp475Asp, Gly482Ser, Thr528Thr, Thr612Met, G+2381A) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The coding region haplotype carrying the rare allele in codons 482 and 528 was associated with elevated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels in an OGTT (p=0.024, adjusted for age, sex and BMI) and a haplotype carrying the rare alleles in codons 394 and 475 was associated with low BMI (p=0.033), high rates of whole-body <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake (p=0.045) and low <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels in the OGTT (p=0.037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We conclude that PPARGC1A is likely to contribute to the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in offspring of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
