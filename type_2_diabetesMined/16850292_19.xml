<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We conducted a case-cohort study (570 incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> cases and 530 non-cases) representing the 9-year experience of 10,275 participants of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Risk in Communities Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasma leptin was measured by direct sandwich ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In proportional hazards models adjusting for age, study centre, ethnicity and sex, high leptin levels (defined by sex-specific cut-off points) predicted an increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, with a hazard ratio (HR) comparing the upper with the lower quartile of 3.9 (95% CI 2.6-5.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, after further adjusting additionally for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> indices, fasting insulin, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> score, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> and adiponectin, high leptin predicted a lower <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk (HR=0.40, 95% CI 0.23-0.67) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additional inclusion of fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> attenuated this protective association (HR=0.59, 95% CI 0.32-1.08, p&lt;0.03 for linear trend across quartiles) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In similar models, protective associations were generally seen across subgroups of sex, race, nutritional status and smoking, though not among those with lower <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> scores or impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (interaction p=0.03 for both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: High leptin levels, probably reflecting leptin resistance, predict an increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adjusting for factors purportedly related to leptin resistance unveils a protective association, independent of adiponectin and consistent with some of leptin's described protective effects against <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
