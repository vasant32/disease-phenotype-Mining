<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the roles of LXRs in pancreatic beta cells have not been fully established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of LXRs on pancreatic beta cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Gene expression was analysed using real-time RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transient transfection and reporter gene assays were used to determine the transcriptional activity of LXRs in pancreatic beta cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cell viability and proliferation were analysed using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>), DNA fluorometric, BrdU labelling and [(3)H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> incorporation assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cell cycle distribution was investigated by flow cytometry analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adenovirus-based <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> interference was used to knockdown LXRalpha, LXRbeta and p27 in MIN6 cells and mouse islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that both Lxralpha (also known as Nr1h3) and Lxrbeta (also known as Nr1h2) were expressed and transactivated the LXR response element in HIT-T15 and MIN6 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Activation of LXRs dose-dependently inhibited pancreatic beta cell viability and proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This was accompanied by beta cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, LXR activation increased levels of the p27 protein by inhibiting its degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Knockdown of p27 reversed these effects of LXR activation on growth inhibition and cell cycle arrest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our observations indicate that LXR activation inhibits pancreatic beta cell proliferation through cell cycle arrest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A well-known regulator of pancreatic beta cell cycle progression, p27, is upregulated and mediates the effects of LXRs on growth inhibition in beta cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest the involvement of aberrant activation of LXR in beta cell mass inadequacy, which is an important step in the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
