<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aims were to describe the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> and identify characteristics associated with progression in a U.S. population-based sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified 10,290 members of a managed care organization who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, a urine albumin-to-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio (UACR) measurement in 2001-2003, and at least 2 follow-up UACRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> was defined as progression to a higher stage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> than was present at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, 57% had normoalbuminuria, 31% had <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp>, and 12% had macroalbuminuria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> progression (per 1000 person-years) was 94.7, 35.1, and 6.5 for normo-, micro-, and macro-<z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ACEi/ARB use ranged from 61-67%, except among patients with macroalbuminuria at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Age, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration, and A1C were significant predictors of progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study, one of the first to examine the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in a U.S. population-based sample, showed that among adults with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, the burden of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> and its progression may be greater than previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further, the use of ACEi/ARBs was not optimal </plain></SENT>
