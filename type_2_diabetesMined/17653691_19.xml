<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We explored the changes in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> subspecies during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5001">fenofibrate</z:chebi> treatment in a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi>-free FIELD cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We randomised 171 participants with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, who had been recruited to the FIELD study in Helsinki, to micronised <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5001">fenofibrate</z:chebi> (200 mg/day) or placebo in double-blind study design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> subspecies were separated by ultracentrifugation at baseline and at the second and fifth year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">Apolipoprotein</z:chebi> (apo)A-I and apoA-II were measured by immunoturbidometric methods and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> (Lp)A-I and LpAI-AII particles by differential immunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5001">Fenofibrate</z:chebi> reduced plasma triacylglycerol levels by 26%, resulting from a marked reduction in VLDL1 triacylglycerol (0.62 vs 0.29 mmol/l, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="5001">Fenofibrate</z:chebi> caused an increase in <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> size (Delta 0.80 nm, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> was similar between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>HDL2-C was decreased by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5001">fenofibrate</z:chebi> (-27.5% at 5th year, p &lt; 0.001) and HDL3-C increased (13.0% at 5th year, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="5001">Fenofibrate</z:chebi> had no effect on apoA-I, whereas apoA-II increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, LpA-I decreased while LpAI-AII increased </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>High <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels were associated with a slight decrease in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> and apoA-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5001">Fenofibrate</z:chebi> markedly reduced large <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi> particles and produced a clear shift in <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> subspecies towards smaller particles </plain></SENT>
