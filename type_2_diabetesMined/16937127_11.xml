<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Elevated NT-proBNP predicts excess morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients with an elevated urinary albumin excretion rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the prognostic value of NT-proBNP in a cohort of type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS, MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a prospective observational follow-up study, 315 type 2 diabetic patients with normoalbuminuria (n=188), <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> (n=80) and macroalbuminuria (n=47) at baseline were followed for a median (range) of 15.5 (0.2-17.0) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma NT-proBNP concentrations were determined by immunoassay at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endpoints were overall and cardiovascular mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the patients, 162 died (51%), 119 of them (74%) due to cardiovascular causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo>-cause mortality was increased in patients with NT-proBNP in the second and third tertiles (hazard ratios [95% CI] compared with the first tertile, 1.70 [1.08-2.67] and 5.19 [3.43-7.88], p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These associations persisted after adjustment for urinary albumin excretion rate, glomerular filtration rate and conventional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> (covariate adjusted hazard ratios 1.46 [0.91-2.33] and 2.54 [1.56-4.14], p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This increased mortality was attributable to more cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in the second and third NT-proBNP tertile (unadjusted hazard ratios 1.63 [0.96-2.77] and 4.88 [3.01-7.91], p&lt;0.001; covariate adjusted 1.37 [0.79-2.37] and 2.26 [1.27-4.02], p=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When patients with normo-, micro- and macroalbuminuria were analysed separately, NT-proBNP levels above the median (62 ng/l) were consistently associated with increased overall and cardiovascular mortality in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three groups (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, elevated circulating NT-proBNP is a strong predictor of the excess overall and cardiovascular mortality, this predictor status being independent of urinary albumin excretion rate and conventional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
