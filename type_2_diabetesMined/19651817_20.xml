<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the engulfment and cell motility 1 (ELMO1) gene, a locus previously shown to be associated with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in two ethnically distinct type 2 diabetic populations, and the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Genotypic data from a genome-wide association scan (GWAS) of the Genetics of Kidneys in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> (GoKinD) study collection were analyzed for associations across the ELMO1 locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In total, genetic associations were assessed using 118 SNPs and 1,705 individuals of European ancestry with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (885 normoalbuminuric control subjects and 820 advanced diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> case subjects) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The strongest associations in ELMO1 occurred at rs11769038 (odds ratio [OR] 1.24; P = 1.7 x 10(-3)) and rs1882080 (OR 1.23; P = 3.2 x 10(-3)) located in intron 16 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two additional SNPs, located in introns 18 and 20, respectively, were also associated with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No evidence of association for variants previously reported in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was observed in our collection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Using GWAS data from the GoKinD collection, we comprehensively examined evidence of association across the ELMO1 locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our investigation marks the third report of associations in ELMO1 with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, further establishing its role in the susceptibility of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There is evidence of allelic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>, contributed by the diverse genetic backgrounds of the different ethnic groups examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further investigation of SNPs at this locus is necessary to fully understand the commonality of these associations and the mechanism(s) underlying their role in diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
