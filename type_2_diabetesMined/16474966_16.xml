<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies indicate that these risks depend on sex and environmental triggers such as age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to investigate the possible interactions between genotype and age and physical activity on risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We genotyped PPARGC1A Gly482Ser, in a population-based study comprising 899 women and 902 men aged between 30 and 75 years in Vara, Sweden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Genotyping revealed that 56% of the males and 57% of the females carried the PPARGC1A 482Ser variant allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Elderly males (&gt;or=50 years) carrying 482Ser had an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> compared with subjects who were homozygous for the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> allele (odds ratio [OR]=1.99, 95% CI 1.14-3.47, p=0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The risk was restricted to males with a low leisure-time physical activity level, and was significantly weaker (OR=0.44, 95% CI 0.22-0.87, p=0.018) for the homozygous 482Gly carriers among this subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> was found in elderly males with a high level of physical activity, in younger males, or in females of any age group or level of physical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our findings confirm that sex and age should be considered when investigating the influence of the PPARGC1A Gly482Ser polymorphism on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> associated with 482Ser is evident only in physically inactive elderly male subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Whenever possible, the level of physical activity should be addressed in future studies on disease risk associated with PPARGC1A Gly482Ser </plain></SENT>
