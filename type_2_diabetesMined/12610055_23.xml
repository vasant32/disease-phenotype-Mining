<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total 616 Japanese subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Polymorphisms of -28 C/G and -403 G/A in the RANTES gene promoter region, and of 59029 G/A in the CCR5 gene promoter region were detected by PCR-RFLP (restriction fragment length polymorphism) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The association of these genotypes with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: While the RANTES -403 genotype showed no association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, the frequency of the -28G allele was significantly higher in the DN2 group (urinary <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp>-to-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio [ACR] &gt;or=300 mg/g <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> &lt;2.0 mg/dl) than in the DN0 (ACR &lt;30 mg/g <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>) and DN1 (ACR &gt;or=30 mg/g <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> and &lt;300 mg/g <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequency of a RANTES -28G-positive genotype (C/G or G/G) was higher in the DN2 group than in the DN0 and DN1 groups (34% vs. 25 and 20%, P = 0.0268, chi(2) = 4.905), and the frequency of a CCR5 59029 A-positive genotype (G/A or A/A) was higher in the DN1 and DN2 groups than in the DN0 group (84 and 85% vs. 76%, P = 0.0123, chi(2) = 6.269) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Discriminant analysis showed that the RANTES -28G-positive genotype and CCR5 59029A-positive genotype were independently associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The percentage of macroalbuminuria was twofold higher in the subjects having -28G or 59029A and threefold higher in the subjects having -28G and 59029A than in the subjects without -28G and 59029A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The RANTES promoter -28G genotype and CCR5 promoter 59029A genotype may be independent risk factors for diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and may have an additive effect on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
