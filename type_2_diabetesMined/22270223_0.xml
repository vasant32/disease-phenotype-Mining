<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To test this hypothesis, erythrocytes were isolated from patients with type 1 (n = 12) and type 2 (n = 12) <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with varying blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and HbA(1c) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These were then compared with erythrocytes isolated from individuals without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 10), with respect to MG, as determined by HPLC, and TP(INT), as determined by endpoint enzymatic assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The concentrations of intracellular TP(INT) and MG were significantly elevated in erythrocytes from diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Normalisation of either TP(INT) or MG to intracellular <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration (nmol <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>/mgHb) confirmed that erythrocytes from diabetic patients accumulated more reactive metabolites than did those from healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Diabetic patients can be characterised by an increased formation of TP(INT) and MG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 25-fold increase of MG in type 1 and the 15-fold increase in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, together with a several-fold increase in TP(INT) and decreased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17138">glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase activity even under <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> conditions, imply that normalising <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level cannot completely prevent late <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> until this acquired error of metabolism has been restored </plain></SENT>
