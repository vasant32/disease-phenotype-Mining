<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: There is a concern that an "epidemic of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>" is occurring in Western societies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One consequence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> is that type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may develop </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Presumably, a great increase in body weight would continue in people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and may be accelerated due to pharmacological treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this retrospective study, we tested the hypothesis that the <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> in a diabetic population is greater than that in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data were obtained from the records of 205 adult men who have attended a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> clinic for &gt; or =5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their weight and glycohemoglobin at the last visit were compared with the initial visit data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The subjects were categorized according to treatment modalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up was 9.4 years (range 5-23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For the group as a whole, the mean increase in body weight was 0.23 +/- 0.2 kg/year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>BMI or initial age had little effect on the rate of <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Treatment regimen used did have an effect on weight change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In subjects treated with insulin, with or without oral agents, body weight increased at a rate of 0.44 +/- 0.1 kg/year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In subjects treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi>, there was a mean loss in weight, i.e., -0.24 +/- 0.09 kg/year, and with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> alone weight increased by 0.42 +/- 0.2 kg/year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The men treated with insulin alone or insulin combined with oral agents gained weight at a rate comparable with that reported for the general population, i.e., the <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> was not extraordinary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> treatment resulted in a modest loss of weight </plain></SENT>
