<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition to lowering blood pressure, blockade of the renin-angiotensin-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27584,30834">aldosterone</z:chebi> system (RAAS) reduces the risk of new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> T2DM and offers renal protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using a MEDLINE search, we identified multiple trials that reported the incidence of T2DM in patients taking inhibitors of RAAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this review, we will discuss the RAAS as a potential target in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention and the mechanisms through which inhibitors of this system achieve such an important effect </plain></SENT>
