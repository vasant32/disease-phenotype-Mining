<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We enrolled offspring of women with pregestational <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (this included type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> in a prospective study from 1977 to 1983 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fetal beta-cell function was assessed by measurement of amniotic fluid insulin (AFI) concentration at 32-38 weeks' gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Postnatally, offspring were seen yearly for neuropsychological testing, measurement of anthropometrics, and modified <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neuropsychological control subjects were followed longitudinally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additional control subjects had anthropometrics measured once, and a random subset of these had a single oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> challenge at 10-16 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rates of major neuropsychological disturbances in our cohort did not differ significantly from national estimates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, aberrant maternal metabolism was associated with poorer intellectual performance and psychomotor development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001520'>macrosomia</z:hpo> observed at birth in offspring of diabetic mothers (ODM) resolves by 1 year of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> recurs in childhood; and by 14-17 years, the mean BMI is 24.6 +/- 5.8 kg/m2 in ODM versus 20.9 +/- 3.4 kg/m2 in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> in adolescence is associated with sex, mother's weight, and AFI concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>Impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) is found in 36% of ODM and is also associated with elevated amniotic fluid insulin in utero </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In confirmation of our original hypothesis, aberrant maternal metabolism is associated with poorer intellectual and psychomotor development, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and IGT in offspring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Excessive insulin secretion in utero, as assessed by AFI concentration, is a predictor of both <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and IGT in adolescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This study is a long-term prospective evaluation of the effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>maternal diabetes</z:hpo> on pregnant women and their offspring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In this article, we report the results of the correlations between indexes of maternal and fetal metabolism during pregnancy and the offspring's subsequent physical, metabolic, and psychological development from birth through adolescence </plain></SENT>
