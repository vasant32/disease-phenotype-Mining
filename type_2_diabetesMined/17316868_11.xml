<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we compared <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi>-induced and glinide-induced insulin secretion in pancreatic beta-cells chronically exposed to these widely used oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> exposure of pancreatic beta-cells to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27999">tolbutamide</z:chebi>) and glinide (nateglinide) similarly impaired their <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> effectiveness by reducing the insulin content and the number of functional K(ATP) channels on the plasma membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Functional expression of the voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels (VDCCs), ion channels that play a critical role in the K(ATP) channel dependent insulin secretory pathway, was similar to that in drug-untreated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> exposure to each of the three agents similarly accelerated apoptotic beta-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, reduction of the insulin content, reduction of the number of functional K(ATP) channels on the plasma membrane, and acceleration of apoptotic beta-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> are involved in impaired insulinotropic agent-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin secretion in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> and glinide treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings help to clarify the mechanism of secondary failure after long-term therapy by these <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi>, and should have important clinical implications regarding pharmacotherapy for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
