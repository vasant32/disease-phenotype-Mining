<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We had reported that haplodeficient Munc13-1(+/-) mouse islet beta-cells exhibited <z:mp ids='MP_0003059'>reduced insulin secretion</z:mp>, causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Munc13-1 binds Epac2 and Rim2, but their functional interactions remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used Munc13-1(+/-) islet beta-cells to examine the functional interactions between Munc13-1 and Epac2 and PKA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>GLP-1 stimulation of Munc13-1(+/-) islets normalized the reduced biphasic insulin secretion by its actions on intact islet cAMP production and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> Epac2 and Rim2 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: To determine which exocytotic steps caused by Munc13-1 deficiency are rescued by Epac2 and PKA, we used patch-clamp capacitance measurements, showing that 1) cAMP restored the reduced readily releasable pool (RRP) and partially restored refilling of a releasable pool of vesicles in Munc13-1(+/-) beta-cells, 2) Epac-selective <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> [8-(4-chloro-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="48499">phenylthio</z:chebi>)-2'-O-methyladenosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphate] partially restored the reduced RRP and refilling of a releasable pool of vesicles, and 3) PKA blockade by H89 (leaving Epac intact) impaired cAMP ability to restore the RRP and refilling of a releasable pool of vesicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conversely, PKA-selective <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> (N(6)-benzoyladenosine-cAMP) completely restored RRP and partially restored refilling of a releasable pool of vesicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To determine specific contributions within Epac-Rim2-Munc13-1 interaction sites accounting for cAMP rescue of exocytosis caused by Munc13-1 deficiency, we found that blockade of Rim2-Munc13-1 interaction with Rim-Munc13-1-binding domain <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> abolished cAMP rescue, whereas blockade of Epac-Rim2 interaction with Rim2-PDZ <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> only moderately reduced refilling with little effect on RRP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: cAMP rescue of priming defects caused by Munc13-1 deficiency via Epac and PKA signaling pathways requires downstream Munc13-1-Rim2 interaction </plain></SENT>
