<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We previously demonstrated a positive association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> aerobic exercise and dorsal foot skin blood flow during local heating in type 2 diabetic individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, we hypothesized that a prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> bout of maximal exercise would also have positive effects on postexercise blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Subjects consisted of 32 individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 26 nondiabetic control subjects further subdivided based on their physical activity status: diabetic exerciser (DE), diabetic sedentary (DS), control exerciser (CE), or control sedentary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dorsal foot cutaneous blood flow was measured noninvasively by continuous laser-Doppler assessment at baseline and during local heating to 44 degrees C before and after a maximal bout of cycle exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interstitial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) levels were measured concurrently in the foot dorsum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Increases in blood flow and its responsiveness to local heating to 44 degrees C were significantly lower in both diabetic groups compared with CE before maximal exercise, but perfusion responsiveness remained lower in DS subjects only after exercise (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Baseline skin blood flow was not different among groups preexercise, but it was significantly increased postexercise in DE subjects only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interstitial NO levels were not significantly different at either time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At baseline, groups differed only in HbA(1c), fasting serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (homeostasis model assessment method) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> diabetic individuals exhibit a blunted responsiveness of cutaneous blood flow with local heating to 44 degrees C before maximal exercise compared with active nondiabetic individuals, but after an exercise bout, it remains significantly blunted only in diabetic individuals who are sedentary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings occur independently of changes in interstitial NO levels </plain></SENT>
