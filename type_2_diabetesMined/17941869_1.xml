<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Many studies suggest that <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> occurs during treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, irrespective of the treatment type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to address the questions (i) whether <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> is inevitable in patients treated for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and (ii) whether treatment escalation is prompted by a rise in glycaemic control [<z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A 1c (HbA 1c)] or <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> database was used to identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> attending our clinic between 1 January 1990 and 31 December 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To facilitate further analysis, independent anonymized database resources were established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data collected included height, weight, gender, HbA(1c), age and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treatment at each visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One thousand and eighty-four patients were included; after 6 months of treatment, patients' average weight had reduced by 1.0 kg (s.d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>4.6) (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sixty per cent of the patients had either a decrease or no change in weight, while 40% demonstrated a <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Women demonstrated more <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> than men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After a mean follow-up of 50 months (s.d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>25.7), 439 patients (40%) who received treatment with diet alone, diet followed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> alone demonstrated a maintained weight reduction in addition to improved glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A rise in HbA(1c) rather than <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> prompted treatment change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> is not a necessary consequence of the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Women were more successful than men in losing weight, and diet, with or without the addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, was the treatment type most usually associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
