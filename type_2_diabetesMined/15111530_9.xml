<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare lifestyle factors, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, and coronary artery calcium (CAC) and abdominal aortic calcium (AAC) levels in Hispanic and non-Hispanic white (NHW) individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We recently demonstrated in a small group of nonreferred, healthy, nondiabetic subjects that CAC was reduced in Hispanics compared with NHWs, despite a worse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factor</z:e> profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we evaluated whether this ethnic disparity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004934'>vascular calcification</z:hpo> was present in individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and in several different arterial beds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hispanic and NHW subjects (n = 245) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were evaluated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> using questionnaires and assays of plasma biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CAC and AAC were measured by electron-beam computer-assisted tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although Hispanics were slightly younger than NHWs, other standard risk factors and novel <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, including plasminogen activator-1 and fibrinogen levels, were similar between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite the similar risk factor profile, the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) and mean and median levels of CAC and AAC were lower in Hispanics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the distribution of these calcium scores differed from that of NHWs (P &lt; 0.05), with significantly fewer Hispanic subjects having high CAC or AAC scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These differences were not explained by differences in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> prevalence or any measured lifestyle or risk factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Hispanics with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have reduced CAC and AAC levels compared with NHW subjects, suggesting a reduction in the overall burden of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004934'>vascular calcification</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data are consistent with the notion that Hispanics are protected against the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
