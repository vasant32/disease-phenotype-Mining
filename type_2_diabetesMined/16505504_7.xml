<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This study was conducted with a cross-sectional community-based survey design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The sample (n = 221) was predominantly female (60.3%), had type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (75%), and was middle class with a mean (+/-SD) age of 54 +/- 12 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 53% were white </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Scale (CESD) (mean 16.4 +/- 11.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using conservative thresholds (CESD score &gt; or =22), 25.3% of participants reported clinically significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> did not differ by ethnic group or <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The majority (76%) of depressed participants reported treatment (52% antidepressants, 63% mental health providers, 19% alternative healers, and 15% herbal remedies) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>African Americans were less likely to report any <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> treatment, to receive antidepressant medications, or receive treatment from a mental health professional compared with whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Participants with high depressive symptoms reported general satisfaction with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> treatment experiences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High rates of depressive symptoms were observed across ethnic groups, yet significant differences in use of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> treatment existed across ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Those seeking <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> treatment reported satisfaction with a variety of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> treatment modalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> screening and treatment may be beneficial for ethnically diverse patients with type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
