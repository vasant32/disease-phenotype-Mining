<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Long-acting insulin analogues, in comparison with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin, should warrant a greater reproducibility of absorption after subcutaneous injection, providing better metabolic control with reduced hypoglycaemic risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aim of the present meta-analysis is the assessment of differences with respect to HbA1c, incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>, between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> human insulin and each long-acting analogue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a duration &gt;12 weeks comparing long-acting insulin analogues (detemir or glargine) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin in type 2 diabetic patients were retrieved; data on HbA1c and BMI at endpoint, and incidence of any, symptomatic, nocturnal, and severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e>, were extracted and meta-analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 14 RCTs was retrieved and included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Long-acting analogues did not produce any significant improvement of HbA1c, in comparison with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> human insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When trials with different analogues were analysed separately, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> showed a significant superiority (by 0.1%) over detemir, but not over glargine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When analysing the effect of long-acting analogues on body weight, detemir, but not glargine, was associated with a significantly smaller <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> than human insulin Both analogues were associated with a reduced risk for nocturnal and symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> (OR: 0.46[0.38-0.55] and 0.69[0.60-0.80]; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Long-acting insulin analogues in type 2 diabetic patients does not seem to provide a better glycemic control in comparison with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin, whereas it reduces the risk of nocturnal and symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Detemir, but not glargine, could be associated with smaller <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin </plain></SENT>
