<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 30 patients were ascertained and investigated for aberrations of chromosome 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A genotype/phenotype study was also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genotypically, these patients can be classified into 4 etiologic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Group 1 had paternal uniparental isodisomy of chromosome 6 (11 cases, including 1 set of identical twins) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Group 2 had a duplication involving chromosome band 6q24, which was paternal in origin where tested (4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases and 7 familial cases from 2 families) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Group 3 consisted of 1 patient with a loss of methylation at a CpG island within the TND critical region (1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> case) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Group 4 had no identifiable rearrangement of chromosome 6 (7 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most patients were growth retarded at birth, presented at a median age of 3 days, and recovered at a median age of 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In group 2, 2 relatives of the TND patients who presented with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and no early history of TND had inherited an identical duplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An abnormality of chromosome 6 was identified in approximately 70% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> TND cases and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> familial cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No significant clinical differences were found between the 4 etiological groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The study has broadened the clinical spectrum of TND to include type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> presenting in later life with no neonatal presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The findings are consistent with an imprinted gene for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> mapping to 6q24, which we predict will have an important function in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pancreatic development </plain></SENT>
