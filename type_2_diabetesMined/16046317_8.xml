<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The AHSG gene, consisting of seven exons and spanning 8.2 kb of genomic DNA, is located at chromosome 3q27, a susceptibility locus for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AHSG is a natural inhibitor of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase, and AHSG-null mice exhibit significantly enhanced insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These observations suggested that the AHSG gene is a strong positional and biological candidate for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Direct sequencing of the AHSG promoter region and exons identified nine common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with a minor allele frequency &gt; or =5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We carried out a detailed genetic association study of the contribution of these common AHSG SNPs to genetic susceptibility of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in French Caucasians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The major allele of a synonymous coding SNP in exon 7 (rs1071592) presented significant evidence of association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P = 0.008, odds ratio 1.27 [95% CI 1.06-1.52]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two other SNPs (rs2248690 and rs4918) in strong linkage disequilibrium with rs1071592 showed evidence approaching significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A haplotype carrying the minor allele of SNP rs1071592 was protective against type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P = 0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, our analyses indicated that rs1071592 is not associated with the evidence for linkage of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> to 3q27 </plain></SENT>
