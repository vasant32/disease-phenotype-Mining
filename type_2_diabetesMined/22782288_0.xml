<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As TCF7L2 rs7903146 has been associated with diminished incretin effect we investigated whether interaction between dietary intake of carbohydrate, fat, protein or fibre and this variant affects the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cohort of 24,799 non-diabetic individuals from the Malmö Diet and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Study (MDCS), with dietary data obtained by a modified diet history method, were followed up for 12 years, with 1,649 recordings of incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in strata of diet quintiles was analysed prospectively adjusting for potential confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cross-sectional analyses were performed on baseline fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and HbA(1c) levels in a subset of 5,216 randomly selected individuals from the MDCS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The elevated risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with rs7903146 (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.33, 1.56, p = 4.6 × 10(-19)) increased with higher intake of dietary fibre (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.04, 1.47 to OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.31, 1.86 from the lowest to highest quintile; p (interaction) = 0.049) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>High intake of dietary fibre was inversely associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence only among CC genotype carriers (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.58, 0.94 per quintile, p = 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The T allele was associated with 0.027% elevated HbA(1c) (p = 0.02) and this effect increased with higher intake of fibre (from -0.021% to 0.079% for the lowest to the highest quintile, p (interaction) = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Each quintile of higher fibre intake was associated with lower HbA(1c) levels among CC and CT but not among TT genotype carriers (-0.036%, p = 6.5 × 10(-7); -0.023%, p = 0.009; and 0.012%, p = 0.52, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our study suggests that dietary fibre intake may modify the association between TCF7L2 rs7903146 and incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and that higher fibre intake may associate with protection from type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> only among non-risk allele carriers </plain></SENT>
