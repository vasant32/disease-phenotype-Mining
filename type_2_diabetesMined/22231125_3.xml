<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used data from 6,390 individuals aged 40-75 years from a multiethnic population based screening study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We developed a logistic regression model for predicting IGR and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (diagnosed using OGTT or HbA(1c) ≥ 6.5% [48 mmol/mol]) from data which are routinely stored in primary care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We developed the score by summing the β coefficients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We externally validated the score using data from 3,225 participants aged 40-75 years screened as part of another study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The score includes age, ethnicity, sex, family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> therapy and BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifty per cent of a population would need to be invited for testing to detect type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> on OGTT with 80% sensitivity; this is slightly raised to 54% that need to be invited if using HbA(1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Inviting the top 10% for testing, 9% of these would have type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> using an OGTT (positive predictive value [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>] 8.9% [95% CI 5.8%,12.8%]), 26% would have IGR (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> 25.9% [95% CI 20.9%, 31.4%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using HbA(1c) increases the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> to 19% for type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> 18.6% [95% CI 14.2%, 23.7%]) and 28% for an HbA(1c) between 6.0% and 6.4% (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> 28.3% [95% CI 23.1%, 34.0%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The score can be used to reliably identify those with undiagnosed IGR and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in multiethnic populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This is the first score developed taking into account HbA(1c) in the diagnosis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
