<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients received 80-240 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi> or 5-15 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> for 6 weeks </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nadir blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were 4.2 (1.0), 4.3 (1.2) and 3.4 (1.0) mmol l(-1) for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi> and controls, respectively (both P=0.07 vs. controls) </plain></SENT>
