<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The decision analytic model, which had a time horizon of 1 year, used the following screening strategies: fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> testing, the oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) following fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> testing in impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (IFG) (fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> + OGTT), OGTT only, and OGTT if HbA(1c) was &gt;5.6% (HbA(1c) + OGTT), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with or without first-step preselection (p) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The main outcome measures were costs (in Euros), true-positive type 2 diabetic cases, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), third-party payers, and societal perspectives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After dominated strategies were excluded, the OGTT and HbA(1c) + OGTT from the perspective of the statutory health insurance remained, as did fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> + OGTT and HbA(1c) + OGTT from the societal perspective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OGTTs (4.90 per patient) yielded the lowest costs from the perspective of the statutory health insurance and fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> + OGTT (10.85) from the societal perspective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HbA(1c) + OGTT was the most expensive (21.44 and 31.77) but also the most effective (54% detected cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ICERs, compared with the next less effective strategies, were 771 from the statutory health insurance and 831 from the societal perspective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the Monte Carlo analysis, dominance relations remained unchanged in 100 and 68% (statutory health insurance and societal perspective, respectively) of simulated populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The most effective screening strategy was HbA(1c) combined with OGTT because of high participation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, costs were lower when screening with fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tests combined with OGTT or OGTT alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The decision regarding which is the most favorable strategy depends on whether the goal is to identify a high number of cases or to incur lower costs at reasonable effectiveness </plain></SENT>
