<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluate risk factors for incident observed <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnea</z:hpo> in a general population not selected for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002360'>sleep disturbances</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 1,780 men and 1,785 women, aged 33 to 68 years, from the cohort Data from an Epidemiologic Study on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin Resistance</z:hpo> Syndrome (D.E.S.I.R.) responded to the question, "Has someone said to you that you stop breathing during your sleep?" at baseline and 6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anthropometric, clinical, and biological factors were recorded at both time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, 14% of men and 7% of women reported having observed <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnea</z:hpo> (positive response to question); 6-year incidences were 14 and 6%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Age, anthropometric parameters, blood pressure, and sleep characteristics were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> associated with prevalent, observed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo> episodes, in both sexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Baseline waist circumference was the strongest predictor of incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo>: standardized odds ratio (OR), adjusted for age and sex, 1.34 (95% CI 1.19-1.52) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for age, sex, and waist circumference, the standardized ORs for incident observed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo> were identical for fasting insulin and the homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>: 1.31 (1.13-1.51) and 1.24 (1.09-1.41) for <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> and 1.52 (1.12-2.05) for smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Observed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo> at baseline was not associated with changes in anthropometric or biological parameters over the 6-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The most important baseline risk factor for incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo> was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After accounting for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e>, other risk factors were high insulin, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, high <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, and smoking, factors amenable to lifestyle intervention </plain></SENT>
