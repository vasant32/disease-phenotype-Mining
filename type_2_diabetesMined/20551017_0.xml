<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We investigated the relationship between carbohydrate intake and postprandial blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (BG) levels to determine the most influential meal for type 2 diabetic subjects treated with basal insulin and needing prandial insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Three-day BG profiles for 37 type 2 diabetic subjects, with A1C levels of 7.7%, treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, and well titrated on insulin glargine, were analyzed using a continuous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Food intake from 680 meals was recorded and quantified during continuous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median BG excursion (DeltaBG) was higher at breakfast than at lunch or dinner (111 [81; 160] vs. 69.5 [41.5; 106] and 82.5 mg/dl [53; 119] mg/dl, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a weak overall correlation between DeltaBG and carbohydrate intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Correlation improved when mealtime was taken into account </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Simple relationships were established: DeltaBG (mg/dl) = 65 x carbohydrate/body weight + 73 for breakfast (R(2) = 0.20, P &lt; 0.0001); the slope was reduced by half at lunch and by one-third at dinner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twelve relevant variables likely to affect DeltaBG were integrated into a polynomial equation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This model accounted for 49% of DeltaBG variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two groups of patients were identified: responders, in whom DeltaBG was well correlated with carbohydrate intake (R(2) &gt;or= 0.30, n = 8), and nonresponders (R(2) &lt; 0.30, n = 29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Responders exhibited a greater insulinopenic profile than nonresponders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The carbohydrate intake in responders clearly drives DeltaBG, whereas, in nonresponders, other factors predominate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This sort of characterization should be used to guide therapeutic choices toward more targeted care with improved type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> management </plain></SENT>
