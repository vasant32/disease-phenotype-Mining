<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine whether aerobic exercise training provided any additional improvements in endothelial function, <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> or other established markers of cardiovascular risk when combined with an energy-restricted diet in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a parallel study design, 29 sedentary, overweight and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (age 52.4 +/- 1.4 years and BMI 34.2 +/- 0.9 kg/m(2)) were randomized to a 12-week moderate energy-restricted diet (~5000 kJ/day and approximately 30% energy deficit) with or without aerobic exercise training [diet only (D), n = 16 and diet plus exercise (DE), n = 13] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Body weight, cardiovascular risk markers, malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>, <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> marker), 24-h urinary nitrate/<z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> and flow-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> (FMD) of the brachial artery were measured pre- and postintervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both interventions <z:mp ids='MP_0001262'>reduced body weight</z:mp> (D 8.9%, DE 8.5%, time effect p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significant reductions in body fat, waist circumference, blood pressure, glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> and increases in urinary <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi>/nitrate were observed in both groups (time effect p &lt; or = 0.05); however, these changes were not different between treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At baseline, FMD was similar in both groups (D 2.5 +/- 0.9%, DE 4.2 +/- 1.2%; p = 0.25) and did not change after the interventions (p = 0.59) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that lifestyle interventions incorporating diet with or without exercise improve glycaemic control, reduce <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and improve other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> but do not improve FMD in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
