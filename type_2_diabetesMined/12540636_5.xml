<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine whether there are single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in this gene that are associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, sequences of the coding and approximately 1 kb of 5' flanking regions in 24 Japanese type 2 diabetic subjects were initially analyzed using PCR direct sequencing, and the regions containing the identified polymorphisms were then examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 200 control subjects, three frequent SNPs were found (g </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>-512C&gt;T [32.3%] and -350G&gt;T [13.0%] in the 5' flanking region and +1548C&gt;T [10.0%] in the 3' flanking region) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Linkage disequilibria were found between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three pairs of these SNPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the eight possible haplotypes defined by these SNPs, only four were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When the frequencies of these SNPs and the four common haplotypes between 195 type 2 diabetic and 200 control subjects were compared, no association was evident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The +898C&gt;T (Pro300Ser), +907C&gt;A (Leu303Met), 1167_1169delCCA (389delHis), and +1251C&gt;A (Ala417Ala) identified in the coding region were rare, although +907C&gt;A could be higher in type 2 diabetic subjects (1.5%) than in control subjects (0.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, the SNPs identified in the FOXC2 gene are unlikely to have major effects on susceptibility to Japanese type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
