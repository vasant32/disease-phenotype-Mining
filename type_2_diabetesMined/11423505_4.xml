<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the accuracy, comfort, and ease of use of a new automated device for blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring using the arm as an alternative sampling site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: These studies use an automated hand-held device that applies a small vacuum, lances the skin, transfers blood onto an electrochemical test strip, and measures <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients who had type 1 or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and had received no prior training using this device were recruited from five <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> clinics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Testing was performed by the patients using this device and by trained healthcare professionals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was measured by 354 patients: from the arm using the device, from the finger using a laboratory reference instrument, and from the finger using the device via the secondary test port </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each patient completed a questionnaire rating the level of pain and ease of use of the device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> results in samples obtained from the arm with the automated device agreed well with finger-stick plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> results using a reference instrument (regression slope 0.98, intercept 0.01 mmol/l [0.1 mg/dl], r = 0.96) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Error grid analysis showed that 100% of the measurements fell within zones A and B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the survey, 60% of the patients reported that arm testing with the automated device was "painless;" another 31% of the patients stated that it was "much less painful," and 6% of patients considered using the device "less painful" than finger-stick testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In a survey containing 15 questions for rating the ease of use with a scale of 1 to 6, the overall mean rating was 5.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The automated device is easy to use and provides accurate <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> results; 97% of the patients found it less painful than finger-stick testing </plain></SENT>
