<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The db/db insulin-resistant mouse model exhibits decreased cardiac performance both in situ and in isolated ex vivo working hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, contractile performance and calcium transients were measured in Langendorff-perfused hearts and isolated cardiac myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diabetic (db/db) mouse hearts demonstrated decreased rates of contraction, relaxation, and pressure development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Calcium transients from isolated myocytes revealed significantly lower diastolic and systolic levels of calcium in diabetic hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the decay rate of the calcium transient was significantly reduced in diabetic myocytes, suggesting a diminished capacity for cytosolic calcium removal not associated with a change in <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>-calcium exchanger activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Calcium leakage from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) measured using tetracaine was significantly increased in diabetic myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis indicated only a small decrease in SERCA2a expression in diabetic mice, but a large increase in phospholamban expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Expression of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> receptor did not differ between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the decreased contractile function observed in the db/db diabetic mouse model appears to be related to decreased calcium handling by the SR </plain></SENT>
