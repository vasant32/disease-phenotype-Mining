<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The major constituent of islet amyloid is islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (amylin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> is synthesized by islet beta cells and co-secreted with insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ability of islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> to form amyloid fibrils is related to its species-specific amino acid sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Islet amyloid associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is only found in man, monkeys, cats and racoons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pharmacological doses of islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> have been shown to inhibit insulin secretion as well as insulin action on peripheral tissues (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To examine the role of islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> in the pathogenesis of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we have generated transgenic mice with the gene encoding either human islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (which can form amyloid) or rat islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi>, under control of an insulin promoter </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Plasma islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> levels were significantly elevated (up to 15-fold) in three out of five transgenic lines, but elevated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020459" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperinsulinaemia</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> were not observed </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> immunoreactivity was localized to beta-cell secretory granules in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> immunoreactivity in beta-cell lysosomes was seen only in mice with the human islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> gene, as in human beta cells, and might represent an initial step in intracellular formation of amyloid fibrils.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
