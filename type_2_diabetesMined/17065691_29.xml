<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Low levels are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to investigate the prospective association between adiponectin levels and the 6.4-year risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and of impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism (IGM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The Hoorn Study is a cohort study among Caucasians, aged 50-75 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BMI, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, alanine aminotransferase, leptin, and adiponectin were measured at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lifestyle (alcohol intake, smoking, and physical activity) was assessed by questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After a mean follow-up of 6.4 years, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance was assessed by a 75-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analyses were performed in 1,264 subjects (584 men and 680 women) without type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For analyses of incident IGM, 239 subjects with IGM at baseline and/or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at follow-up were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Age- and lifestyle-adjusted odds ratios and 95% CIs comparing highest with lowest adiponectin quartile were 0.52 (0.23-1.18) in men and 0.15 (0.06-0.39) in women for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 0.90 (0.51-1.61) and 0.28 (0.16-0.48) for IGM, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The risks were only slightly reduced after adjustment for WHR and leptin as markers of (abdominal) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Adjustment for baseline fasting and postload <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels (potential mediators) substantially diminished these inverse associations with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (0.79 [0.32-1.91] and 0.62 [0.21-1.81]) and with IGM (1.20 [0.61-2.35] and 0.48 [0.26-0.90]), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A high adiponectin level was strongly associated with a lower risk of IGM and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, particularly in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that adiponectin is involved in the pathophysiology linking <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
