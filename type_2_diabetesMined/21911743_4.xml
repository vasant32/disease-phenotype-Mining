<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the potential role of FoxP3-expressing regulatory T cells (Tregs) in reversing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-linked <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519106" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">rodent models</z:e> and humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: To characterize the role of Tregs in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, human visceral adipose tissue was first evaluated for Treg infiltration and second, the db/db mouse model was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>Obese</z:mp> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> displayed significantly decreased natural Tregs but an increase in adaptive Tregs in their visceral adipose tissue as compared with lean control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To further evaluate the pathogenic role of Tregs in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, the db/db mouse model was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treg <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> using an anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody enhanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> as shown by increased fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels as well as an impaired insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, Treg-depleted db/db mice developed increased signs of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, such as <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> and glomerular hyperfiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was paralleled by a proinflammatory milieu in both murine visceral adipose tissue and the kidney </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conversely, adoptive transfer of CD4(+)FoxP3(+) Tregs significantly improved insulin sensitivity and diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, there was increased <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of FoxP3 as well as less abundant proinflammatory CD8(+)CD69(+) T cells in visceral adipose tissue and kidneys of Treg-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Data suggest a potential therapeutic value of Tregs to improve <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and end organ damage in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by limiting the proinflammatory milieu </plain></SENT>
