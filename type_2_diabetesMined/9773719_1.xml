<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study in which subjects with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in four treatment strata (77 on diet alone, 83 treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, 103 treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi>, and 91 treated with insulin) were randomized to treatment with placebo or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> for 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Before randomization, and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after randomization, fasting blood was obtained for HbA1c, and 3-day diet records were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects who completed at least 6 months of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> therapy and provided at least three 3-day diet records were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the 114 subjects included in this analysis, carbohydrate intake varied from approximately 30-60% of energy There was no significant relationship between carbohydrate intake and change in HbA1c in any of the four treatment strata (diet: n=26, r=0.35, P=0.076; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>: n=27, r=0.26, P=0.19; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi>: n=35, r=0.24, P=0.16; insulin: n=25, r=-0.27, P=0.19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the 80 subjects consuming &lt;50% of energy from carbohydrate, the fall in HbA1c (7.83 +/-0.17% at baseline to 6.72+/-0.13% on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi>, P &lt; 0.001) was no different from that of the 34 subjects consuming &gt;50% of energy from carbohydrate (7.55+/-0.25% at baseline to 6.66+/-0.23% on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi>, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in carbohydrate intake between those who dropped out of the study because of gastrointestinal side effects and those who did not, and there was no relationship between severity of symptoms and the composition of the diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> consuming 30-60% of energy from carbohydrate, the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> on HbA1c and gastrointestinal symptoms was not related to carbohydrate intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Because most people consume at least 30% of energy from carbohydrate, we conclude that no special diet is needed for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> to be effective in improving blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control in the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
