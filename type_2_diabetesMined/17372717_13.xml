<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to examine the relationship between leptin levels and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301700" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular morbidity</z:e> and overall mortality in women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This prospective cohort study included 1,194 women with a confirmed diagnosis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, who provided a blood sample at baseline in 1989-1990 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Participants were followed for 12 years for the development of health outcomes including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) events as well as total mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 218 new <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> events and 228 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to estimate the relative risks (RRs) for each quintile level of leptin compared with the lowest quintile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Leptin levels were positively associated with several <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk factors including BMI and inflammatory markers, but were not independently associated with the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> or total mortality in women with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The multivariate RRs (95% CIs) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> across the quintiles of leptin were 0.96 (0.61-1.53), 0.99 (0.61-1.61), 1.04 (0.63-1.71), 1.02 (0.59-1.75) (p for trend = 0.83) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Although circulating leptin levels are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and inflammatory markers, they are not significantly related to the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> or mortality in women with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
