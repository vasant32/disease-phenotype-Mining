<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This multicenter randomized open-controlled trial was conducted in outpatient <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> clinics in 15 U.K. hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 591 subjects who had already been randomly allocated to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> therapy were taking maximum doses with suboptimal glycemic control, i.e., raised fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) concentrations of 6-15 mmol/l but no significant hyperglycemic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The main outcome measures included FPG, glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, protocol-defined marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, body weight, blood pressure, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, compliance, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> and other side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After the addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, FPG concentrations decreased by mean (95% CI) -0.47 (-0.82 to -0.13) mmol/l over 3 years compared with an increase of 0.44 (0.07-0.81) mmol/l in subjects on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> alone (P &lt; 0.00001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median FPG concentrations at 3 years were 8.6 vs. 9.9 mmol/l, respectively (P &lt; 0.00001), and HbA1c values were 7.5 and 8.1%, respectively (P = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adjustment for baseline BMI or FPG concentration did not affect response to therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only 7% of those allocated to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> developed protocol-defined marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> compared with 36% of those allocated to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> alone (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, body weight, and blood pressure did not change significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001988'>hypoglycemic episodes</z:hpo> did not differ between groups: 4% on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and 2% on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> alone (NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Early addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> improved glycemic control in patients with suboptimal glycemic control while taking maximum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> therapy, irrespective of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> or baseline FPG concentrations </plain></SENT>
