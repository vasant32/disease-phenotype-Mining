<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The inbred mouse strain C57BLKS/J (BKS) carrying a mutation of the leptin receptor lepr(-/-) (BKS-db) is a classic mouse model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While BKS was originally presumed to be a substrain of C57BL/6J (B6), it has become apparent that its genome contains introgressed regions from a <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>/2 (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>)-like strain and perhaps other unidentified sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been hypothesized that the strikingly enhanced <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility of BKS-db compared with B6-db is conferred by this introgressed DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using high-density single nucleotide polymorphisms, we have mapped the <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> and other contaminating DNA regions present in BKS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, approximately 70% of its genome appears to derive from B6, with approximately 20% from <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> and another 9% from an unidentified donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparison with 56 diverse inbred strains suggests that this donor may be a less common inbred strain or an outbred or wild strain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using expression data from a B6 x <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> cross, we identified differentially regulated genes between these two strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Those cis-regulated genes located on <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>-like blocks in BKS constitute primary candidates for genes contributing to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility in the BKS-db strain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To further prioritize these candidates, we identified those cis-acting expression quantitative trait loci whose expression significantly correlates with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related phenotypes </plain></SENT>
