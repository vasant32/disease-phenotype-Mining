<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To study the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi>, an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, on glycemic control in elderly patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Elderly patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treated with diet alone were randomly treated in a double-blind fashion with placebo (n=99) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> (n=93) for 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 12 months of therapy, there was a statistically significant difference in the change in glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA(1c)) (-0.6%) in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> group versus placebo, as well as in the incremental post-prandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> values (-2.1 mmol h/l) and mean fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (-0.7 mmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although there was no effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> on insulin release, there was a clear effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> to decrease relative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (-0.8) (HOMA method) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> was generally well tolerated and safe in the elderly; most discontinuations were due to gastrointestinal side effects such as flatulence and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> reported, and no clinically relevant changes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001939'>laboratory abnormalities</z:hpo> or vital signs during the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">Acarbose</z:chebi> improves the glycemic profile and insulin sensitivity in elderly patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who are inadequately controlled on diet alone </plain></SENT>
