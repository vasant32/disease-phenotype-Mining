<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Inhibition of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> cotransporter type 2 (SGLT2) is currently being pursued as an insulin-independent treatment for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; however, the behavioral and metabolic consequences of SGLT2 deletion are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we used a SGLT2 knockout mouse to investigate the effect of increased renal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excretion on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis, insulin sensitivity, and pancreatic β-cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: SGLT2 knockout mice were fed regular chow or a high-fat diet (HFD) for 4 weeks, or backcrossed onto the db/db background </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The analysis used metabolic cages, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests, euglycemic and hyperglycemic clamps, as well as isolated islet and perifusion studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SGLT2 deletion resulted in a threefold increase in urine output and a 500-fold increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003076'>glucosuria</z:hpo>, as well as compensatory increases in feeding, drinking, and activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SGLT2 knockout mice were protected from HFD-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> and had reduced plasma insulin concentrations compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the db/db background, SGLT2 deletion prevented fasting <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, and plasma insulin levels were also dramatically improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Strikingly, prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> by SGLT2 knockout in db/db mice preserved pancreatic β-cell function in vivo, which was associated with a 60% increase in β-cell mass and reduced incidence of β-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Prevention of renal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> reabsorption by SGLT2 deletion reduced HFD- and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, improved <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo>, and increased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these data support SGLT2 inhibition as a viable insulin-independent treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
