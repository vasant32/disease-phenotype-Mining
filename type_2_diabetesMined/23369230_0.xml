<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We examined the accuracy of random capillary <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (RCG) and two noninvasive screening methods, the <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk test (DRT) and skin fluorescence spectroscopy (SFS) as measured by Scout DS for detecting HbA1c-defined dysglycemia or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in an at-risk cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Subjects were recruited at two clinical sites for a single non-fasting visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each subject had measurements of height, weight and waist circumference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> score was calculated from skin fluorescence measured on the left forearm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A finger prick was done to measure RCG and HbA1c (A1C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Health questionnaires were completed for the DRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increasing dysglycemia was defined as A1C≥5.7% (39mmol/mol) or ≥6.0% (42mmol/mol) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was defined as A1C≥6.5% (47.5mmol/mol) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 398 of 409 subjects had complete data for analysis with means for age, body mass index, and waist of 52 years, 27kg/m(2) and 90cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>51% were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of A1C≥5.7%, ≥6.0% and ≥6.5% were 54%, 34% and 12%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Areas under the curve (AUC) for detection of increasing levels dysglycemia or <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for RCG were 63%, 66% and 72%, for the <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> DRT the AUCs were 75%, 76% and 81% and for SFS the AUCs were 82%, 84% and 90%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>For each level of dysglycemia or <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the SFS AUC was significantly higher than RCG or the <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> DRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The noninvasive skin fluorescence spectroscopy measurement outperformed both RCG and the <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> DRT for detection of A1C-defined dysglycemia or <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in an at-risk cohort </plain></SENT>
