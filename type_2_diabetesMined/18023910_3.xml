<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three hundred and four type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients were inquired with a structured questionnaire about socio-demographic characteristics, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038443" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychological stress</z:e>, coping styles, social support, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and depressive symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multiple regression analysis was performed to assess the association of these psychosocial factors with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and depressive symptoms after controlling for potential confounding factors of sex, age, educational level, etc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After adjusting for the potential confounding factors, multiple stepwise regression analysis found that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> symptoms were significantly positively associated with "worrying about to be harmed by the disease", "social/family crisis caused by the disease", "worrying about declining in body/physical function", "declined economic condition caused by the disease" and "negative coping styles"; and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> symptoms were significantly positively associated with "worrying about to be harmed by the disease", "worrying about declining in body/physical function", "social/family crisis caused by the disease", "declined economic condition", "negative coping styles", but negatively with "active coping styles" and "subjective social support" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings show that perceived stress from disease, coping styles, social support are the independent determinants of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and depressive symptoms among Chinese patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
