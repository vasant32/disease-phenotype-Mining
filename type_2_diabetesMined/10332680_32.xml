<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to analyze the prevalence, incidence, and mortality of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a population of 280,539 inhabitants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The incidence, prevalence, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> from <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ages of a population have been prospectively followed in the county of Skaraborg, Sweden, since 1991 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The annual incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> per 100,000 inhabitants in 1991-1995 was (mean +/- 95% CI) 14.7 +/- 3.2 for type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (diagnosed at 24.1 +/- 2.2 years of age) and 265.6 +/- 16.1 for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (diagnosed at 66.6 +/- 0.6 years of age) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was significantly (P &lt; 0.001) higher among men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no significant change in the age at diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the incidence rate and the age at diagnosis were constant, the prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> increased by 6% each year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relative mortality risk for diabetic patients was almost four times higher than expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, however, increased significantly, from 77.2 to 80.2 years (P &lt; 0.05), during the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence but not the incidence rate of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> increased during the years 1991-1995 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although diabetic patients showed a high relative mortality, increased survival apparently explains the increase in prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the country of Skaraborg </plain></SENT>
