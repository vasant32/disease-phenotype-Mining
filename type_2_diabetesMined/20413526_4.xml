<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A representative cohort ratio of 6,460 British men was followed-up for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence between 1984 (aged 45-65 years) and 2007 (aged 67-89 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BMI was ascertained at regular intervals before and during the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between 1984-1992 and 1999-2007, the age-adjusted hazard of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> more than doubled (hazard ratio 2.33 [95% CI 1.75-3.10]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean BMI rose by 1.42 kg/m(2) (95% CI 1.10-1.74) between 1984 and 1999; this could explain 26% (95% CI 17-38) of the type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: An appreciable portion of the rise in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> can be attributed to BMI changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A substantial portion remains unexplained, possibly associated with other determinants such as physical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This merits further research </plain></SENT>
