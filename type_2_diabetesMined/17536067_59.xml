<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We examined the association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, measured as either a continuous symptom severity score or a clinical disorder variable, with self-care behaviors in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We surveyed 879 type 2 diabetic patients from two primary care clinics using the Harvard Department of Psychiatry/National <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Screening Day Scale (HANDS), the Summary of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Self-Care Activities, and self-reported medication adherence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the patients, 19% met the criteria for probable major <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (HANDS score &gt;or=9), and an additional 66.5% reported at least some depressive symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After controlling for covariates, patients with probable major <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> reported significantly fewer days' adherent to diet, exercise, and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> self-monitoring regimens (P &lt; 0.01) and 2.3-fold increased odds of missing medication doses in the previous week (95% CI 1.5-3.6, P &lt; 0.001) compared with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other respondents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Continuous depressive symptom severity scores were better predictors of nonadherence to diet, exercise, and medications than categorically defined probable major <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Major <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> was a better predictor of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the two-thirds of patients not meeting the criteria for major <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (HANDS score &lt;9, n = 709), increasing HANDS scores were incrementally associated with poorer self-care behaviors (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings challenge the conceptualization of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> as a categorical risk factor for nonadherence and suggest that even low levels of depressive symptomatology are associated with nonadherence to important aspects of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interventions aimed at alleviating depressive symptoms, which are quite common, could result in significant improvements in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-care </plain></SENT>
