<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>Obese</z:mp> and overweight type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients treated with insulin for at least 1 year, and with poor glycaemic control (HbA1c &gt; upper reference level + 2%), were included in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were treated for 12 months with either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (850 mg b.i.d.) or placebo added to their usual insulin, which was stabilized during a 3-month placebo run-in period, but thereafter attempted to be unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two patients dropped out during run-in </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no differences between the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (n = 16) and placebo (n = 19) group at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most patients received multiple insulin injections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Metabolic control was improved by addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean change in HbA1c from baseline showed highly significant difference between groups at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean change (percentage units +/- s.d.) at 12 months was -1.1 +/- 0.7% vs. + 0.3 +/- 0.8% (p &lt; 0.001) for HbA1c and -1.4 +/- 2.1 mmol/l vs. + 0.6 +/- 2.2 mmol/l (p = 0.025) for fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>) cholesterol change differed slightly at 6 months, but not at 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no changes in insulin dose, blood pressure, body weight, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, total- and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>) cholesterol, fibrinogen, C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> and laboratory safety variables, including serum <z:chebi fb="13" ids="33611">B12</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Combination therapy was well-tolerated with the same adverse event rate as insulin alone, but more patients with diarrhoea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> to insulin induced and maintained clinically significant and consistent long-term reduction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, insulin-treated type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
