<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was carried out in 40 drug-naïve adult patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A metabolic profile including interleukin (IL)-1β, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-α, IL-6, and fasting insulin levels was carried out before the intervention and 2 months afterward </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A hyperglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp technique was performed to assess the phases of insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After randomization, 20 patients received diacerein (50 mg once daily) for the first 15 days and twice daily for 45 additional days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The remaining patients received placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intra- and intergroup differences were calculated by Wilcoxon signed rank and Mann-Whitney U tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were significant increases in first (102±63 vs. 130±75 pmol/L; P&lt;0.01), late (219±111 vs. 280±135 pmol/L; P&lt;0.01), and total insulin (178±91 vs. 216±99 pmol/L; P&lt;0.01) secretions without changes in insulin sensitivity after diacerein administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were significant decreases in fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (7.9±1.4 vs. 6.8±1.0 mmol/L; P&lt;0.01) and in A1C levels (8.3±1.0 vs. 7.0±0.8%; P&lt;0.001) after diacerein administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no significant changes after placebo administration in the above-mentioned evaluations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Insulin secretion increased and metabolic control improved after diacerein administration in drug-naïve patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
