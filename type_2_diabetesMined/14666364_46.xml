<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to define the level of glycaemia at which <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta-cell dysfunction</z:hpo> becomes evident in the context of existing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Insulin response (OGTT) and insulin sensitivity (euglycaemic insulin clamp) were evaluated in 388 subjects in the San Antonio Metabolism (<z:chebi fb="75" ids="15414">SAM</z:chebi>) study (138 NGT, 49 IGT and 201 T2DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects the insulin secretion/<z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> index (DeltaI/DeltaG/IR) was calculated as the ratio of the increment in plasma insulin to the increment in plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> during the OGTT divided by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, as measured during the clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In lean NGTs with a 2-h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration (2-h PG) between 5.6 and 6.6 and between 6.7 and 7.7 mmol/l, there was a progressive decline in DeltaI/DeltaG/IR compared with NGTs with a 2-h PG less than 5.6 mmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a further decline in DeltaI/DeltaG/IR in IGTs with a 2-h PG between 7.8 and 9.3 and between 9.4 and 11.0 mmol/l, and in Type 2 diabetic patients with a 2-h PG greater than 11.1 mmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lean and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects showed coincident patterns of relation of 2-h PG to DeltaI/DeltaG/IR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: When the plasma insulin response to oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> is related to the glycaemic stimulus and severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, there is a progressive decline in beta-cell function that begins in "<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>" <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerant individuals </plain></SENT>
