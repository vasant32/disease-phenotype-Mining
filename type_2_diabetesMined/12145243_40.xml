<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may be present for several years before diagnosis, by which time many patients have already developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Earlier detection and treatment may reduce this burden, but evidence to support this approach is lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Glycemic control and clinical and surrogate outcomes were compared for 5,088 of 5,102 U.K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Prospective Study participants according to whether they had low (&lt;140 mg/dl [&lt;7.8 mmol/l]), intermediate (140 to &lt;180 mg/dl [7.8 to &lt;10.0 mmol/l]), or high (&gt; or =180 mg/dl [&gt; or =10 mmol/l]) fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) levels at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Individuals who presented with and without diabetic symptoms were also compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fewer people with FPG in the lowest category had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, abnormal biothesiometer measurements, or reported <z:hpo ids='HP_0000802'>erectile dysfunction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rate of increase in FPG and HbA(1c) during the study was identical in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three groups, although absolute differences persisted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Individuals in the low FPG group had a significantly reduced risk for each predefined clinical outcome except <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, whereas those in the intermediate group had significantly reduced risk for each outcome except <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The low and intermediate FPG groups had a significantly reduced risk for progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, reduction in vibration sensory threshold, or development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: People presenting with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with lower initial glycemia who may be earlier in the course of their disease had fewer adverse clinical outcomes despite similar glycemic progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Since most such people are asymptomatic at diagnosis, active case detection programs would be required to identify them </plain></SENT>
