<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This multicenter study was designed to explore the prevalence of clinical and subclinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013473" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">eating disorders</z:e> (EDs), the extent of intentional omission of insulin and oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> agents, and its relationship to glycemic control in an inpatient and outpatient population of men and women with type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data have been collected from 12 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> medical centers in two German cities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a questionnaire and interview-based study, a sample of male and female patients (n = 341 type 1, n = 322 type 2) was assessed for the following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013473" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">eating disorders</z:e>: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002039'>anorexia</z:hpo> nervosa, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100739'>bulimia</z:hpo> nervosa, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596170" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">binge eating disorder</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013473" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">eating disorder</z:e> not otherwise specified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For lack of interview data of several patients meeting the screening criteria, prevalence ranges were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall prevalence range of current EDs was 5.9-8.0% (lifetime prevalence 10.3-14.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When patients were stratified according to type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, there was no difference in prevalence of EDs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the distribution of the EDs was different in both types of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, with a predominance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596170" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">binge eating disorder</z:e> in the type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Type 1 (5.9%) and type 2 (2.2%) diabetic patients reported deliberate omission of hyperglycemic drugs (insulin or oral agents) in order to lose weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with control subjects, neither the presence of EDs nor insulin omission influenced diabetic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There seems to be no difference in prevalence rates of EDs in both types of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; however, distribution of EDs is different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The findings suggest that neither EDs nor insulin omission are necessarily associated with poor control of glycemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596170" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Binge eating disorder</z:e> seems to precede type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in most patients and could be one of the causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> that often precedes type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
