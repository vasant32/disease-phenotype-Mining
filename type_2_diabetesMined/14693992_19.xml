<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The association between WBC count and vascular complications of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> has not been explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We carried out a cross-sectional cohort study to determine the association between WBC count and the presence of macro- and microvascular complications in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this study, 3,776 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> WBC count (3.5-12.5 x 10(9)/l) underwent a comprehensive assessment of complications and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> based on the European DiabCare protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Demographic and anthropometric parameters were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Metabolic profiles, including complete blood picture and urinary albumin excretion, were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with higher WBC counts (categorized into quintiles) had adverse metabolic profiles as evidenced by higher blood pressure, BMI, HbA(1c), fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, and urinary albumin excretion, but lower <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt;0.001 for trend) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of macro- and microvascular complications increased in a dosage-related manner with WBC count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After adjustments for smoking and other known <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, a 1-unit (1 x 10(9)/l) increment of WBC count was associated with a 15.8% (95% CI 9.3-22.6; P &lt; 0.001) and 12.3% increase (5.8-19.1; P &lt; 0.001) in the prevalence of macro- and microvascular complications, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Elevated WBC count, even within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range, is associated with both macro- and microvascular complications in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, as indicated by a higher WBC count, may play a linkage role in the development of macro- and microvascular complications in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
