<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate the prevalence and clinicopathological characteristics of islet amyloid, we examined consecutive autopsies of 235 Chinese patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 533 nondiabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Islet amyloid deposits were identified using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34653">Congo red</z:chebi> staining and quantitated by image analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that 3.0% of the nondiabetic subjects versus 39.6% of the diabetic patients displayed islet amyloid (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In diabetic patients, the amyloid deposits occupied a mean islet area of 36.2%, which was positively associated with BMI, blood pressure, and glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100732'>Pancreatic fibrosis</z:hpo> and fat infiltration were more frequently found in diabetic patients with islet amyloid than those without islet amyloid, whereas pancreatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> was identified in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that islet amyloid deposits reflect greater <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and islet failure in a subgroup of type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Islet failure may also have been exacerbated by fat infiltration, <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Optimal blood pressure and metabolic control may reduce these pathological changes and help preserve islet cell mass </plain></SENT>
