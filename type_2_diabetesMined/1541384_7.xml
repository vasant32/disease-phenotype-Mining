<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore hypomagnesaemia might contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As the influence of improved metabolic control on plasma <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> levels is unknown in Type 2 diabetic patients we studied <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> plasma levels in 50 patients 1) before, 2) one and 3) three months after the initiation of insulin therapy or intensified treatment with oral hypoglycaemic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">Magnesium</z:chebi> plasma levels were measured by a colorimetric method and were significantly reduced in diabetic patients compared to healthy control subjects (0.79 +/- 0.01 mmol/l vs 0.88 +/- 0.01 mmol/l; p less than 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Metabolic control was significantly improved as documented by reduced HbA1C levels in both insulin-treated patients or the patients on oral hypoglycaemic agents (p less than 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, plasma <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> levels remained unchanged during the follow-up in the insulin-treated group (1: 0.79 +/- 0.02 mmol/l; 2: 0.81 +/- 0.02 mmol/l; 3: 0.79 +/- 0.01 mmol/l) as well as in the patients on oral hypoglycaemic agents (1: 0.79 +/- 0.03 mmol/l; 2: 0.78 +/- 0.02 mmol/l; 3: 0.84 +/- 0.04 mmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study shows that even marked improvement of glycaemic control does not correct hypomagnesaemia in Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that hypomagnesaemia might be related to the insulin-resistant state and that possible beneficial effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> administration should be evaluated in these patients </plain></SENT>
