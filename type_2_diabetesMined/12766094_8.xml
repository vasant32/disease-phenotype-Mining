<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of nateglinide added to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> monotherapy on glycemic control and on postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin levels in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This 24-week, multicenter, double-blind, randomized study compared the efficacy of nateglinide (120 mg a.c.) and placebo added to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> monotherapy (8 mg q.d.) in 402 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with HbA(1c) between 7 and 11% (inclusive) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Efficacy parameters tested included HbA(1c) and plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin levels in the fasting state and after a standardized meal challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Safety data were also collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In placebo-treated patients, HbA(1c) did not change (Delta = 0.0 +/- 0.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients randomized to nateglinide, HbA(1c) decreased from 8.3 to 7.5% (Delta = -0.8 +/- 0.1%, P &lt; 0.0001 vs. placebo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Target HbA(1c) (&lt;7.0%) was achieved by 38% of patients treated with combination therapy and by 9% of patients remaining on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In nateglinide-treated patients, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels decreased by 0.7 mmol/l, 2-h postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels decreased by 2.7 mmol/l, and 30-min insulin levels increased by 165 pmol/l compared with no changes from baseline of these parameters with placebo added to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: By selectively augmenting early insulin release and decreasing prandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excursions, nateglinide produced a clinically meaningful improvement in overall glycemic exposure in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> inadequately controlled with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, nateglinide substantially improves the likelihood of achieving a therapeutic target of HbA(1c) &lt;7.0% </plain></SENT>
