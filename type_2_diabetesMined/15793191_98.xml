<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Participants with IGT are at high risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>), with a marked increase in the number and severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We prospectively assessed the impact of our interventions on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study group consisted of 3,234 individuals with IGT randomly assigned to receive intensive lifestyle intervention, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Annual assessment of blood pressure, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, electrocardiogram, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> events was undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> was present in 30% of participants at study entry and then increased in the placebo and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> groups, although it significantly decreased with intensive lifestyle intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">Triglyceride</z:chebi> levels fell in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treatment groups, but fell significantly more with intensive lifestyle intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Total cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> levels were similar among treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intensive lifestyle intervention significantly increased the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> level and reduced the cumulative incidence of the proatherogenic <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> phenotype B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 3 years of follow-up, the use for pharmacologic therapy to achieve established goals in the intensive lifestyle group was 27-28% less for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and 25% less for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> compared with placebo and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Over an average of 3 years, 89 CVD events from 64 participants were positively adjudicated studywide, with no differences among treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Lifestyle intervention improves <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk factor status compared with placebo and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although no differences in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> events were noted after 3 years, achieved risk factor modifications suggest that longer intervention may reduce <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> event rates </plain></SENT>
