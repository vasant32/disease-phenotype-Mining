<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-seven T2DM subjects received oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT), euglycaemic insulin clamp with deuterated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, measurement of total body fat (DEXA), quantitation of muscle/liver (MRS) and abdominal subcutaneous and visceral (MRI) fat, and then were randomized to receive, in addition to diet, muraglitazar (MURA), 5 mg/day, or placebo (PLAC) for 4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HbA1c(c) decreased similarly (2.1%) during both MURA and PLAC treatments despite significant <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> with MURA (+2.5 kg) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> with PLAC (-0.7 kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, free fatty acid (FFA), hsCRP levels <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> decreased with MURA while plasma adiponectin and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> increased (p &lt; 0.05-0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Total body (muscle), hepatic and adipose tissue sensitivity to insulin and β cell function <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> improved with MURA (p &lt; 0.05-0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intramyocellular, hepatic and abdominal visceral fat content decreased, while total body and subcutaneous abdominal fat increased with MURA (p &lt; 0.05-0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Muraglitazar (i) improves glycaemic control by enhancing insulin sensitivity and β cell function in T2DM subjects, (ii) improves multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, (iii) reduces muscle, visceral and hepatic fat content in T2DM subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite similar reduction in A1c with PLAC/diet, insulin sensitivity and β cell function did not improve significantly </plain></SENT>
