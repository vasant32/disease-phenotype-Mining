<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Coffee consumption is associated with reduced risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but the mechanism is not clearly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Elevated C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, as a marker of insulin secretion, has been linked to insulin-resistant type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined consumption of caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee and total <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi> in relation to concentrations of plasma C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Plasma C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> concentrations were measured in a cross-sectional setting among 2,112 healthy women from the Nurses' Health Study I who provided blood samples in 1989-1990 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Consumption of caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee and total <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi> was assessed using a semiquantitative food-frequency questionnaire in 1990 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Intakes of caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee and <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi> in 1990 were each inversely associated with C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> concentration in age-adjusted, BMI-adjusted, and multivariable-adjusted analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In multivariable analysis, concentrations of C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> were 16% less in women who drank &gt;4 cups/day of caffeinated or decaffeinated coffee compared with nondrinkers (P &lt; 0.005 for each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Women in the highest quintile compared with the lowest quintile of <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi> intake had 10% lower C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We did not find any association between tea and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The inverse association between caffeinated coffee and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> was considerably stronger in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (27% reduction) and overweight women (20% reduction) than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> weight women (11% reduction) (P = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest a potential reduction of insulin secretion by coffee in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This reduction may be related to other components in coffee rather than <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
