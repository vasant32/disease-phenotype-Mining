<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 120 patients with uncontrolled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were randomly assigned to receive their care in group visits or usual care for 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After 6 months, concordance with 10 process-of-care indicators recommended by the American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association (<z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi>) standards of care was evaluated through chart abstraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 10 items evaluated were up-to-date HbA(1c) levels and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profiles, urine for microalbumin, appropriate use of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitor</z:chebi> or angiotensin receptor blockers, use of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering agents where indicated, daily aspirin use, annual foot examinations, annual referrals for <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> examinations, and immunizations against streptococcal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021400" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FLU">influenza</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients who received care in group visits showed statistically significant improvement in concordance with these 10 process-of-care indicators (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the patients, 76% who received care in group visits had at least 9 of these 10 items up to date, as compared with 23% of control patients; 86% of patients in group visits had at least 8 of the 10 indicators compared with 47% of control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Group visits proved more effective in promoting concordance with <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> standards of care than usual care in the treatment of uninsured or inadequately insured patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
