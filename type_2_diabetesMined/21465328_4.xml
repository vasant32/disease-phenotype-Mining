<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Besides pancreatic beta cell defects, a low number of beta cells (low beta cell mass) may contribute to the insufficient secretion of insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study our aim was to determine whether the alpha cell mass is also altered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using a point counting method, we measured the ratio of alpha to beta cell areas in pancreas samples obtained at autopsy from 50 type 2 diabetic subjects, whose beta cell mass had previously been found to be 36% lower than that of 52 non-diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The topography of alpha and beta cells was similar in both groups: many alpha cells were localised in the centre of the islets and the ratio of alpha/beta cell areas increased with islet size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The average ratio was significantly higher in type 2 diabetic subjects (0.72) than in non-diabetic subjects (0.42), with, however, a large overlap between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the alpha cell mass was virtually identical in type 2 diabetic subjects (366 mg) and non-diabetic subjects (342 mg), and was not influenced by sex, BMI or type of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The higher proportion of alpha to beta cells in the islets of some type 2 diabetic subjects is due to a decrease in beta cell number rather than an increase in alpha cell number </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This imbalance may contribute to alterations in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> inhibitory influence exerted by beta cells on alpha cells, and lead to the relative hyperglucagonaemia observed in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
