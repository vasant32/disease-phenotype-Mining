<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty men and 38 women with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> with a body mass index (BMI) of &gt; 25 kg/m2 participated in a prospective randomized study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were either on oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> lowering drugs (n = 39) or insulin therapy (n = 19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Physical training consisted of a guided, standardized, 6-week training programme performed in the hospital on a cyclo ergometer followed by a 6-week period of guided training at home and ended in a 12-week period of training at home without supervision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical data and laboratory samples including fasting insulin and leptin levels and maximal aerobic capacity were assessed at the start of the study and at 6 and 26 weeks thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Physical training resulted in significantly positive changes in maximal aerobic capacity (VO2max) and maximum work load </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No effects of physical training on serum leptin levels and insulin concentrations were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Leptin levels were strongly correlated with body mass index (r = 0.63), body fat content (r = 0.61), and fasting insulin concentrations (r = 0.38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Women had threefold higher leptin levels than men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No differences in leptin levels between patients on insulin therapy and patients on oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> lowering drugs were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: No effect of physical training on leptin levels was detectable in elderly, <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
