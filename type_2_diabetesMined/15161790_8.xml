<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At this time, however, there is no definitive proof that alcohol per se has an effect on the insulin sensitivity index (S(i)) in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to assess the role of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> moderate alcohol intake on insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion in comparable subjects with and without type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Frequently sampled intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests (FSIGTs) were performed twice on eight healthy and eight type 2 diabetic volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty grams of alcohol (vodka 40% wt/vol) or tap water were sipped from time -60 min to the end of the FSIGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">Lactate</z:chebi> area under the curve (AUC) was higher in both groups during the alcohol study than in the control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Free fatty acid (FFA) AUC was higher in type 2 diabetic subjects than in control subjects; alcohol slightly reduced FFA by 17% in control subjects (34 +/- 4 mmol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>min(-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>l(-1); P = 0.1) but significantly decreased FFA by 23% in type 2 diabetic subjects (54 +/- 10; P = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Beta-cell response was markedly reduced in type 2 diabetic subjects regardless of the type of study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Alcohol significantly increased S(i) in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> alcohol consumption improves insulin action without affecting beta-cell secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This effect may be partly due to the inhibitory effect of alcohol on lipolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Alcohol intake increases insulin sensitivity and may partly explain both the J-shaped relationship between the prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the amount of alcohol consumption and the decreased mortality for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
