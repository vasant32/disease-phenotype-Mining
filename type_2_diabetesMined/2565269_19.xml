<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aetiology of fibrocalculous pancreatic <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is thought to be environmental although the agent(s) is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have investigated a possible genetic basis of this disease by looking for restriction fragment length polymorphisms of genes implicated in the aetiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seventy-six Dravidian patients with fibrocalculous pancreatic <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were studied, and the restriction fragment length polymorphisms obtained compared to racially matched control subjects (n = 94), patients with Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 87) and Type 1 (insulin-dependent) <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 58) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No association of fibrocalculous pancreatic <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was found with restriction fragment length polymorphisms of the insulin receptor gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although no association of fibrocalculous pancreatic <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was found with polymorphism of the HLA DR alpha/DQ alpha/DX alpha genes, an association was found with the Taq 1 restriction fragment length polymorphisms of the DQ beta gene (DQ beta T2/T6 present in 39% of patients with fibrocalculous pancreatic <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared to 19% in control subjects; p = 0.01; corrected p value = 0.04) which is similar to that found in Type 1 but not Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An association of fibrocalculous pancreatic <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was also found with the hypervariable region in the 5-prime flanking region of the insulin gene; 40% of patients possessed the class 3 allele compared to 9.5% of control subjects p = 0.0001; corrected p value = 0.0008).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
