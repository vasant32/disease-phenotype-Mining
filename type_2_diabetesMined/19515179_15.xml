<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To compare the tolerability and efficacy of vildagliptin to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> as add-on therapy in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> inadequately controlled with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy over 1-year duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This 52-week, multicentre, randomized, active-controlled study compared vildagliptin (50 mg b.i.d., n = 295) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (30 mg daily, n = 281) in patients with inadequate glycaemic control [<z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA(1c)) 7.5-11%] receiving a stable dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (&gt;or=1500 mg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary objective was to demonstrate non-inferiority of vildagliptin at 24 weeks in the change in HbA(1c) from baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objective of the additional 28 weeks of the study was to assess long-term safety, while also assessing mean change from baseline to study end in HbA(1c), fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: When added to a stable dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (mean baseline dose approximately 2 g/day), the non-inferiority of HbA(1c) lowering of vildagliptin to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> over 24 weeks was established at the non-inferiority margin of 0.3% (between-group difference = 0.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the remaining 28 weeks, comparable HbA(1c) decreases were recorded in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall adverse event (AE) rates were similar in both groups, as was the occurrence of peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hypoglycaemia</z:e> occurred rarely in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serious AEs occurred more frequently with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>While mean body weight increased significantly in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> group (+2.6 kg) from baseline, there was no significant <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> with vildagliptin (+0.2 kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: When added to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, vildagliptin demonstrates favourable safety and tolerability over 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Vildagliptin provided additional HbA(1c) lowering to that achieved with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> alone and comparable to that achieved with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>, with only <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> causing <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
