<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to assess the associations of physical activity time and television (TV) time with risk of "undiagnosed" abnormal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in Australian adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This population-based cross-sectional study using a stratified cluster design involving 42 randomly selected Census Collector Districts across Australia included 8,299 adults aged 25 years or older who were free from new type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and self-reported ischemic disease and did not take <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive drugs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Abnormal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism (impaired fasting glycemia [IFG], <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> [IGT], or new type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) was based on an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Self-reported physical activity time and TV time (previous week) were assessed using interviewer-administered questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After adjustment for known confounders and TV time, the odds ratio (OR) of having abnormal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism was 0.62 (95% CI 0.41-0.96) in men and 0.71 (0.50-1.00) in women for those engaged in physical activity &gt;or=2.5 h/week compared with those who were sedentary (0 h/week) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ORs of having abnormal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism were 1.16 (0.79-1.70) in men and 1.49 (1.12-1.99) in women who watched TV &gt;14 h/week compared with those who watched &lt;or=7.0 h/week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Higher TV viewing (&gt;14 h/week) was also associated with an increased risk of new type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in men and women and IGT in women compared with those watching &lt;14 h/week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Total physical activity of &gt;or=2.5 h/week was associated with a reduced risk of IFG, IGT, and new type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in both sexes; however, only the association with IGT in women was statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a protective effect of physical activity and a deleterious effect of TV time on the risk of abnormal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Population strategies to reduce risk of abnormal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism should focus on reducing sedentary behaviors such as TV time, as well as increasing physical activity </plain></SENT>
