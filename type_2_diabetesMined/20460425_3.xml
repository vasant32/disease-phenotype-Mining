<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, a genome-wide association study for diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> revealed four novel candidate loci in European American subjects with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we determined the association of the four loci with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in Japanese subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We genotyped 11 singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in four distinct loci (rs39059 and rs39075 in the CPVL/CHN2, rs1888747 and rs10868025 in FRMD3, rs739401 and rs451041 in CARS, and rs1041466, rs1411766, rs6492208, rs7989848, and rs9521445 in a chromosome 13q locus) in four independent Japanese populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six SNPs were nominally associated with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in one of the four Japanese populations (P &lt; 0.05; rs451041 in study 1; rs39059 and rs1888747 in study 3; rs1411766 in studies 1 and 4; and rs7989848 and rs9521445 in study 4); however, no significant association was observed for any SNP after correction for multiple testing errors in the individual populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, a meta-analysis performed for the data obtained from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four populations revealed that one SNP (rs1411766) in chromosome 13q was significantly associated with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in the Japanese populations (nominal P = 0.004, corrected P = 0.04, odds ratio 1.26 [95% CI = 1.07-1.47]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the rs1411766 locus may be commonly involved in conferring susceptibility to diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> among subjects with type 1 or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> across different ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
