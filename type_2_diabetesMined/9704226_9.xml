<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The extent of this risk depends both on the diagnostic criteria used to identify <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> and on maternal risk factors, some of which are potentially modifiable whereas others are not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The unmodifiable risk factors are ethnicity, pre-pregnancy weight, age, parity, family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> in pregnancy and immediately postpartum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The modifiable risk factors are persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, future <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>, and subsequent pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additional modifiable risk factors in these women are likely to be levels of physical activity, dietary fat, and avoidance of other lifestyle factors that adversely influence <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, such as smoking and certain drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diabetic prevention strategies need to address the potentially modifiable risk factors using the unmodifiable risk factors to identify women most at risk </plain></SENT>
