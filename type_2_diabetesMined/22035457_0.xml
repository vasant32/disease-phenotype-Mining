<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Identifying the mechanisms involved in its development and propagation will help the development of preventative and therapeutic strategies that may help control its rising rates.<z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> low-grade <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, and this is believed to be one of the major contributors to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, which is an early event in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and leads to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> when the pancreas fails to keep up with increased demand for insulin </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of immune cells at the interface with metabolic organs modulates both metabolic function and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory responses</z:mp> in these organs, and may provide a potential therapeutic target to modulate metabolic function in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
