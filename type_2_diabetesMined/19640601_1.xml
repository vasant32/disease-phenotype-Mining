<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 18 subjects (10 with T2DM, 8 CON) had graded brachial artery infusions of endothelial dependent (<z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi>: 15, 30, 60 microg/min), endothelial independent (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi>: 1, 3, 10 microg/min) and partially endothelial mediated (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi>: 50, 150, 500 microg/min) <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilators</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The protocol was repeated during a hyperinsulinemic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forearm blood flow and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> extraction were measured at each dose of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> (with/without insulin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Measurements were also taken in the control arm, reflecting systemic insulin infusion only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Non-insulin mediated increases in bulk forearm blood flow were similar in T2DM and CON </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, insulin mediated forearm blood flow responses and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> extraction were lower in T2DM versus CON </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The vasodilatory effect of insulin is impaired in T2DM although bulk flow capacity is maintained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Insulin mediated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> extraction is reduced during concomitant maximal stimulation of forearm blood flow with endothelial-dependent <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilators</z:chebi>, despite maintaining flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This is consistent with previous work that associates T2DM with impaired insulin mediated capillary recruitment </plain></SENT>
