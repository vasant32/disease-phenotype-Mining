<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about how clinical teams should support adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> to achieve and sustain a physically active lifestyle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (published up to January 2012) to establish the effect of behavioral interventions (compared with usual care) on free-living PA/exercise, HbA(1c), and BMI in adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Study characteristics, methodological quality, practical strategies for increasing PA/exercise (taxonomy of behavior change techniques), and treatment fidelity strategies were captured using a data extraction form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventeen RCTs fulfilled the review criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Behavioural interventions showed statistically significant increases in objective (standardized mean difference [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SMD</z:e>] 0.45, 95% CI 0.21-0.68) and self-reported PA/exercise (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SMD</z:e> 0.79, 95% CI 0.59-0.98) including clinically significant improvements in HbA(1c) (weighted mean difference [WMD] -0.32%, 95% CI -0.44% to -0.21%) and BMI (WMD -1.05 kg/m(2), 95% CI -1.31 to -0.80) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Few studies provided details of treatment fidelity strategies to monitor/improve provider training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intervention features (e.g., specific behavior change techniques, interventions underpinned by behavior change theories/models, and use of â‰¥10 behaviour change techniques) moderated effectiveness of behavioral interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Behavioral interventions increased free-living PA/exercise and produced clinically significant improvements in long-term <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Future studies should consider use of theory and multiple behavior change techniques associated with clinically significant improvements in HbA(1c), including structured training for care providers on the delivery of behavioural interventions </plain></SENT>
