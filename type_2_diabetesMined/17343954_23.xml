<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Improvements in patient management to promote tight control of glycaemia have helped to reduce the prevalence of microvascular complications, but <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> continue to be the leading cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Globally, the number of people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is predicted to almost double over the next 30 years, with much of this increase occurring in developing countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The growing prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> is the major factor driving the increasing prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and the increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in adolescents is of particular concern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Consequently, the overall number of people with the vascular complications of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is also predicted to increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prevention of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is the best strategy for reducing the risk of complications, and screening of high-risk individuals is already being promoted in some countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lifestyle changes, focusing on diet, exercise and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> are effective in preventing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in such people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, more information is required about the long-term sustainability of these changes, and programmes also need to be adapted to meet the needs of developing countries </plain></SENT>
