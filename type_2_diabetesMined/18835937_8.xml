<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: White adipose tissue is a critical regulator of whole-body <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Preadipocyte factor-1 (Pref-1) is a secreted protein that inhibits adipocyte differentiation, both in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have investigated the effects of Pref-1 overexpression on whole-body <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis and its contribution to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: To gain insight into the role of Pref-1 on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we measured body composition and whole-body insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism during a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp in Pref-1 transgenic and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> control mice fed a high-fat diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mice overexpressing Pref-1 were resistant to high-fat diet-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, as reflected by a marked reduction in adipose tissue mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, Pref-1-overexpressing mice were severely insulin resistant, mainly because of a reduction in insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The aggravated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> was associated with impaired insulin signaling and increased diacylglycerol content in skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Mice overexpressing Pref-1 are insulin resistant despite being protected from diet-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and may provide a new <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519106" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">rodent model</z:e> for the study of lipodystrophic disorders </plain></SENT>
