<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to determine the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> biogenesis and expression of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation in subcutaneous fat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were randomly divided into two groups and treated with placebo or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (45 mg/day) for 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>Mitochondrial</z:hpo> DNA copy number and expression of genes involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> biogenesis were quantified by real-time PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">Pioglitazone</z:chebi> treatment significantly increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> copy number and expression of factors involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> biogenesis, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma coactivator-1alpha and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> transcription factor A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> stimulated the expression of genes in the fatty acid oxidation pathway, including <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi> palmitoyltransferase-1, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15531">malonyl-CoA</z:chebi> decarboxylase, and medium-chain <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17984">acyl-CoA</z:chebi> dehydrogenase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression of PPAR-alpha, a transcriptional regulator of genes encoding <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation, was higher after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, the increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> copy number and the higher expression of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation in human adipocytes may contribute to the hypolipidemic effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
