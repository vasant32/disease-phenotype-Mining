<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To determine whether inpatient <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> management and education with improved transition to outpatient care (IDMET) improves glycemic control after hospital discharge in patients with uncontrolled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult inpatients with T2DM and HbA1c &gt; 7.5% (58 mmol/mol) admitted for reasons other than <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> to an academic medical center were randomly assigned to either IDMET or usual care (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Linear mixed models estimated treatment-dependent differences in the change in HbA1c (measured at 3, 6, and 12 months) from baseline to 1-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-one subjects had mean age 55 ± 12.6 years, with mean HbA1c of 9.7 ± 1.6% (82 ± 18 mmol/mol) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean inpatient <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was lower in the IDMET than in the UC group (176 ± 66 versus 195 ± 74 mg/dl [9.7 versus 10.8 mmol/l], P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the year after discharge, the average HbA1c reduction was greater in the IDMET group compared with the UC group by 0.6% (SE 0.5%, [7 (SE 5)mmol/mol], P = 0.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among patients newly discharged on insulin, the average HbA1c reduction was greater in the in the IDMET group than in the UC group by 2.4% (SE 1.0%, [25 (SE 11)mmol/mol], P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Inpatient <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> management (IDMET) substantially improved glycemic control 1 year after discharge in patients newly discharged on insulin; patients previously treated with insulin did not benefit </plain></SENT>
