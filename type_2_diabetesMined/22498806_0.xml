<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We examined the prevalence of knowledge of A1C, blood pressure, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (ABC) levels and goals among people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, its variation by patient characteristics, and whether knowledge was associated with achieving levels of ABC control recommended for the general diabetic population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data came from 1,233 adults who self-reported <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the 2005-2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants reported their last ABC level and goals specified by their physician (not validated by medical record data) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis included descriptive statistics and logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among participants tested in the past year, 48% stated their last A1C level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, 63% stated their last blood pressure level and 22% stated their last <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Knowledge of ABC levels was greatest in non-Hispanic whites, lowest in Mexican Americans, and higher with more education and income (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P â‰¤ 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Demographic associations were similar for those reporting physician-specified ABC goals at the American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association-recommended levels (A1C &lt;7%, blood pressure &lt;130/80 mmHg, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> &lt;100 mg/dL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nineteen percent of participants stated that their provider did not specify an A1C goal compared with 47% and 41% for blood pressure and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> goals, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For people who self-reported A1C &lt;7.0%, 83% had an actual A1C &lt;7.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Otherwise, participant knowledge was not significantly associated with risk factor control, except for in those who knew their last <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> level (P = 0.046 for A1C &lt;7.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Results from logistic regression corroborated these findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Ample opportunity exists to improve ABC knowledge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> education should include behavior change components in addition to information on ABC clinical measures </plain></SENT>
