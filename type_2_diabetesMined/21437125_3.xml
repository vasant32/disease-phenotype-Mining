<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Alogliptin is an oral antihyperglycemic agent that is a selective inhibitor of the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of DPP-4 elevates levels of the incretin hormones glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (GLP-1) and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent insulinotropic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (GIP) by preventing their degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To review the evolution of alogliptin and its pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, clinical efficacy and adverse effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, we compared alogliptin to other DPP-4 inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was performed using the term 'alogliptin' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Original research articles and review articles as well as scientific abstracts were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Alogliptin raises postprandial levels of GLP-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It has excellent bioavailability exhibiting a median T(max) ranging from 1 to 2 hours and a mean half-life of 12.4 to 21.4 hours across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When given as monotherapy, mean <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c) (HbA(1c)) reductions achieved were 0.5% to 0.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Combination therapy yielded similar reductions (-0.5% with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, -0.6% with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi>, -0.8% with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> and -0.6% with insulin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Administration of alogliptin does not promote <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> but has not resulted in <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The agent is relatively well tolerated with few adverse effects, the major finding being a marginally higher rate of skin events, primarily <z:hpo ids='HP_0000989'>pruritus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Alogliptin causes significant reductions in HbA(1c) when used alone or in combination with other oral agents in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> similar to other DPP-4 inhibitors in current clinical use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The side effect profile also does not differ from that of other DPP-4 inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, long-term studies are necessary before the place of alogliptin in the management of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> can be established </plain></SENT>
