<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MS was defined in accordance with the Adult Treatment Panel III (ATPIII) guidelines, while FL and CAC were identified by computed tomography.RESULTSThere were increasing frequencies of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and CAC in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three groups: control, MS without FL, and MS plus FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multivariable-adjusted logistic regression analyses showed that FL increased the association of MS with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in both women [odds ratio 10.6 (95% CI 3.4-33.7)] and men [12.1 (4.1-36.1)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In women, FL also increased the association of MS with CAC [2.34 (1.07-5.12)].CONCLUSIONSFL increases the association of MS with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
