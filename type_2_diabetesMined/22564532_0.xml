<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We now implanted osmotic pumps which allowed a constant release of saline or SR59230A (0.6 mg/kg × day) for 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A decrease in islet blood flow was seen also after 2 weeks of continuous SR59230A treatment in the GK rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, no improvement in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance was seen in the GK rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neither did SR59230A affect insulin secretion from isolated islets in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>WAT blood flow was not affected by the 2-week SR59230A treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, the increased islet blood flow seen in the GK rat can be normalized for up to 2 weeks, which opens the possibilities for further studies on the long-term functional role on the islet blood flow increase in this type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> model </plain></SENT>
