<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 811 non-diabetic relatives from 278 pedigrees of northern European extraction in which there was a sib-pair with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were recruited and studied at the six <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> UK Warren Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Heritability estimates were calculated, allowing for key covariates (age, sex, BMI and recruitment centre) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Values greater than 0.10 were considered statistically significant in comparison to zero </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration and homeostasis model assessment of pancreatic beta cell function (HOMA %B) had the highest heritability estimates of 0.72 and 0.78 respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Heritability estimates for the features of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> syndrome (BMI, WHR, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and homeostasis model assessment of insulin sensitivity [HOMA %S]) were also high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The heritability estimate for fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was markedly higher in the present study (0.77 vs 0.21 adjusted for age and sex; p&lt;0.001) than in a comparable study of families from the same background population but with no increased susceptibility to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the estimates for the features of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> syndrome were similar in the two studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In families with a high risk of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the heritability estimates for fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, pancreatic beta cell function and the features of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> syndrome were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The higher heritability estimate for pancreatic beta cell function suggests that this resource may be most effective when investigating genetic susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta cell dysfunction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
