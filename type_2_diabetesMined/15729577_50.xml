<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanistic basis of this phenomenon is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we investigate the effect of early growth restriction on the expression of insulin-signalling proteins in skeletal muscle in a human cohort and a rat model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We recruited 20 young men with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birthweight</z:hpo> (mean birthweight 2702+/-202 g) and 20 age-matched control subjects (mean birthweight 3801+/-99 g) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Biopsies were obtained from the vastus lateralis muscle and protein expression of selected insulin-signalling proteins was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rats used for this study were male offspring born to dams fed a standard (20%) protein diet or a low (8%) protein diet during pregnancy and lactation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Protein expression was determined in soleus muscle from adult offspring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>Low-birthweight</z:hpo> subjects showed reduced muscle expression of protein kinase C (PKC)zeta, p85alpha, p110beta and GLUT4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PKCzeta, GLUT4 and p85 were also reduced in the muscle of rats fed a low-protein diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Other proteins studied were unchanged in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low-birthweight</z:hpo> humans and in rats fed a low-protein diet when compared with control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We found decreased expression of specific insulin-signalling proteins in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low-birthweight</z:hpo> subjects compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These changes precede the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The similarity of protein expression profile in the men with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birthweight</z:hpo> compared to that of the offspring of rats fed a low-protein diet suggests that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519106" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">rodent model</z:e> is an accurate representation of the human situation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It also provides a potential mechanistic explanation as to why the fetal environment plays an important role in determining risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
