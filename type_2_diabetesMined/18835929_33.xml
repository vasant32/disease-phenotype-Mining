<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because skeletal muscle has been shown to secrete proteins that could be used as biomarkers, we characterized the secreted protein profile of muscle cells derived from extremely <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (BMI 48.8 +/- 14.8 kg/m(2); homeostasis model assessment [HOMA] 3.6 +/- 1.0) relative to lean healthy subjects (BMI 25.7 +/- 3.2 kg/m(2); HOMA 0.8 +/- 0.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We hypothesized that skeletal muscle would secrete proteins that predict the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, we used a "bottom-up" experimental design using stable isotope labeling by amino acids in culture (SILAC) and liquid chromatography/mass spectometry/mass spectometry (LC-MS/MS) to both identify and quantify proteins secreted from cultured myotubes derived from extremely <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> compared with healthy nonobese women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Using SILAC, we discovered a 2.9-fold increase in the secretion of myostatin from extremely <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> human myotubes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The increased secretion and biological activity of myostatin were validated by immunoblot (3.16 +/- 0.18, P &lt; 0.01) and a myoblast proliferation assay using conditioned growth medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Myostatin was subsequently shown to increase in skeletal muscle (23%, P &lt; 0.05) and plasma (35%, P &lt; 0.05) and to correlate (r(2) = 0.6, P &lt; 0.05) with the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Myostatin is a potent antianabolic regulator of muscle mass that may also play a role in energy metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings show that increased expression of myostatin in skeletal muscle with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> results in elevated circulating myostatin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This may contribute to systemic metabolic deterioration of skeletal muscle with the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
