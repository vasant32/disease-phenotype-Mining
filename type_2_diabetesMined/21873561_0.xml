<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relevance of these serological markers in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> remains elusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the association of serological markers (elongation factor 1α [EF-1α], stathmin, and N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-glucosaminidase) with leukocyte telomere length, a functional variant of uncoupling protein-2 (UCP2), and susceptibility of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 930 patients and 867 control subjects were recruited to examine the association between leukocyte telomere length, UCP2 variant (-886G&gt;A), recently identified serological markers, and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Telomere length was determined by a quantitative real-time PCR-based assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EF-1α, stathmin, and C-reactive proteins were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-glucosaminidase was measured by an enzyme activity assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The UCP2 variant was determined by PCR and restriction enzyme digestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The average telomere length of type 2 diabetic patients was significantly shorter than that of control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Serological N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-glucosaminidase correlates with both age and telomere length and was significantly higher in patients than in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Neither EF-1α nor stathmin showed significant difference between patients and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The UCP2-886G&gt;A variant correlated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> status but did not correlate with telomere length or the serological markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that higher serological N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-glucosaminidase, shorter telomeres, and the UCP2-886G&gt;A variant are independent risk factors for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Serological N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-glucosaminidase, telomere length, and the UCP2-886G&gt;A variant are independent risk factors for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Serological N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-glucosaminidase correlates with telomere length but not with the UCP2-886G&gt;A variant </plain></SENT>
