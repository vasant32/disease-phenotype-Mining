<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been shown to act on the liver, muscle and pancreatic Î²-cells to uniquely target the key defects of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two studies were performed to compare the safety and efficacy of imeglimin with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and placebo on glycaemic control in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a 4-week phase IIa, three-arm parallel group study, patients were randomized to imeglimin 2000 mg once daily (od), imeglimin 1000 mg twice daily (bid) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> 850 mg bid and responses to an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In an 8-week phase IIa, four-arm controlled multi-centre study, patients were randomized to imeglimin 500 mg bid, imeglimin 1500 mg bid, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> 850 mg bid or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Glycaemic assessments included area under the curve (AUC) up to 6 h (AUC(0-6h)) for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> during a prolonged meal, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) and HbA1c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Safety and tolerability were assessed in both studies through adverse event recording and laboratory parameters, vital signs and electrocardiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Imeglimin was found to be as effective as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> at reducing the AUC(PG) and AUC(0-6h) , FPG and HbA1c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Imeglimin exhibited a favourable tolerability profile in comparison to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results from both studies confirm that imeglimin displays a superior benefit : risk profile compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The encouraging tolerability profile of imeglimin could make it suitable for combination with other classes of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> agents and may increase availability to a wider patient population </plain></SENT>
