<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report two novel GCK mutations (T65I and W99R) that have arisen de novo in two families with familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Insulin levels, although inappropriately high for the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>, remain regulated by fluctuations in glycemia, and pancreatic histology was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These mutations are within the recently identified heterotropic allosteric activator site in the theoretical model of human beta-cell glucokinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Functional analysis of the purified recombinant glutathionyl S-transferase fusion proteins of T65I and W99R GCK revealed that the kinetic changes result in a relative increased activity index (a measure of the enzyme's phosphorylating potential) of 9.81 and 6.36, respectively, compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The predicted thresholds for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin release using mathematical modeling were 3.1 (T65I) and 2.8 (W99R) mmol/l, which were in line with the patients' fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we have identified two novel spontaneous GCK-activating mutations whose clinical phenotype clearly differs from mutations in ATP-sensitive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> channel genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In vitro studies confirm the validity of structural and functional models of GCK and the putative allosteric activator site, which is a potential drug target for the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
