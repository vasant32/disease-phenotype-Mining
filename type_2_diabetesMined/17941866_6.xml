<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Anthropometric measurements (waist and hip circumference, sagittal diameter and percentage body fat) were then conducted in a hospital setting followed by an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) to identify subjects at the highest risk and analyse the factors predicting that risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A health questionnaire was administered to 435 subjects in a community setting and BMI was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects were graded by a risk score based on the health questionnaire as high, medium and low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects with high and medium risk scores and a representative sample of those with low scores had anthropometric measurements in hospital followed by an OGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In total, 205 (47%) of the subjects had an OGTT performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, 48.7% of the subjects tested with an OGTT had evidence of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> dysregulation: 20% had <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 28.7% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression model explained 49.1% of the total variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The significant predictors of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and IGT were Blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> Monitoring Strips (BMI), random blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (BM), sibling with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and presence of diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> or ischaemic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most of these predictors along with other heredity <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> factors create a composite score, with high predictability, as the receiver operating curve analysis shows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We describe a simple, stepwise strategy in a community setting, based on a health questionnaire and anthropometric measurements, to explain about 50% of cases with IGT and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and diagnose about 50% of cases from the population screened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We have also identified factors that predict the risk </plain></SENT>
