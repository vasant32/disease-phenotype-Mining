<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and hepatic fat are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and vary by sex and ethnicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, pancreatic fat fraction (PFF) has also been linked with increasing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to assess ethnic and sex differences in PFF and its relationship to other fat depots, circulating free fatty acids (FFA), insulin secretion and sensitivity, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> adolescents and young adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We examined 138 (40 males, 98 females) <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> Hispanics and African Americans (13-25 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subcutaneous adipose tissue and VAT volumes, hepatic fat fraction (HFF), and PFF were determined by magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity and β-cell function were assessed during an intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Hispanics had higher PFF than African Americans (7.3 ± 3.8 vs. 6.2 ± 2.6%, P = 0.03); this ethnic difference was higher in young adults compared with children and adolescents (ethnicity × age: P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Males had higher PFF than females (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PFF was positively correlated with VAT (r = 0.45, P &lt; 0.0001), HFF (r = 0.29, P &lt; 0.0001), and FFA (r = 0.32, P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PFF positively correlated with inflammatory markers but lost significance when adjusted for VAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In multiple stepwise regression analysis, VAT and FFA were the best predictors of PFF (adjusted R(2) = 0.40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no significant correlations between PFF and markers of insulin sensitivity or β-cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PFF is higher in Hispanics than African Americans, and this difference increases with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In young <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals, PFF is related to VAT, HFF, and circulating FFA, thus possibly contributing to their increased risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
