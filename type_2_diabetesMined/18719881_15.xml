<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to test the cumulative effects of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-risk alleles on measures of beta cell function in non-diabetic individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 1,211 non-diabetic individuals underwent metabolic assessment including an OGTT, from which measures of beta cell function were derived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Individuals were genotyped at each of the risk loci and then classified according to the total number of risk alleles that they carried </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Initial analysis focused on CDKAL1, HHEX/IDE and TCF7L2 loci, which were individually associated with a decrease in beta cell function in our cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Risk alleles for CDKN2A/B, SLC30A8, IGF2BP2 and KCNJ11 loci were subsequently included into the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-risk alleles for CDKAL1, HHEX/IDE and TCF7L2 showed an additive model of association with measures of beta cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Beta cell <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> sensitivity was decreased by 39% in those individuals with five or more risk alleles compared with those individuals with no risk alleles (geometric mean [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>]: 84 [1.07] vs 137 [1.11] pmol min(-1) m(-2) (mmol/l)(-1), p = 1.51 x 10(-6)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The same was seen for the 30 min insulin response (p = 4.17 x 10(-7)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The relationship remained after adding in the other four susceptibility loci (30 min insulin response and beta cell <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> sensitivity, p &lt; 0.001 and p = 0.003, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: This study shows how individual type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-risk alleles combine in an additive manner to impact upon pancreatic beta cell function in non-diabetic individuals </plain></SENT>
