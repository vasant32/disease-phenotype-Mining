<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study was carried out in 4066 British men aged 60 to 79 years who were not on <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> or insulin, of whom there were 426 men with prevalent Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 842 with prevalent CHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Men with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were more likely to have multiple risk factors and higher levels of haemostatic and inflammatory markers than men without, irrespective of CHD status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared with men with CHD only, men with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> only showed increased levels of tissue plasminogen activator antigen, increased plasma and blood viscosity, and increased levels of coagulation factors VII, VIII and IX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They also had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In men with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (homeostasis model assessment, HOMA) was associated with increased levels of haemostatic markers and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of CHD increased significantly with increasing tertiles of HOMA (adjusted odds ratio 1.32 [95% CI: 0.72-2.42] in the second, and 1.70 [95% CI: 0.92-3.44] in the third tertile; p=0.04 for trend) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> among men with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is associated with increased prevalence of CHD and of activated haemostasis and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Reducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in men with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may reduce their tendency to develop <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and hence CHD risk </plain></SENT>
