<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Five hundred and seventy-six patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> of at least 6 months' duration were randomized to receive monotherapy with repaglinide (n = 383) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi> (n = 193) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During weeks 1-8, doses were gradually increased to achieve a target fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) range of 80-140 mg/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The final adjusted dose was maintained for 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Repaglinide patients received a starting dose of 0.5 mg three times/day preprandially, adjusted as necessary to 1, 2 or 4 mg before breakfast, lunch and dinner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">Glyburide</z:chebi> patients received a starting dose of 2.5 mg before breakfast and placebo before lunch and dinner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">Glyburide</z:chebi> was increased as necessary to 5 or 10 mg before breakfast (placebo before lunch and dinner) or to 15 mg (10 mg before breakfast, placebo before lunch, and 5 mg before dinner) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After study drug was stopped, patients were transferred to an appropriate therapy, as recommended by the investigator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Efficacy was assessed by changes from baseline in glycemic control parameters and in C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, insulin, and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Repaglinide provided glycemic control that was at least as effective and potentially safer than that provided by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering effect of repaglinide was most pronounced in pharmacotherapy-naive patients, who showed rapid and marked decreases in mean glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels from baseline (9.4%) to month 3 (7.6%) and month 12 (7.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mean FPG levels also decreased overall in this group, from 222 mg/dl at baseline, to 175 mg/dl at month 3, to 188 mg/dl at month 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>At endpoint, morning C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels had increased significantly in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi>-treated patients compared with those treated with repaglinide, but morning fasting insulin levels did not differ significantly between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Repaglinide efficacy was sustained over 1 year and was not influenced by age or sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Overall safety and changes in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile and body weight were similar with both agents, with no significant change after extended pharmacotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>Weight gain</z:mp> data for the subset of pharmacotherapy-na√Øve patients suggest that patients given repaglinide may gain less weight than those given <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Repaglinide, at doses of 0.5-4.0 mg administered three times preprandially, was well tolerated and provided safe and consistently effectiveglycemic control during this 1-year study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Patients using repaglinide received the same therapeutic benefits as those using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi>, and may have received additional benefits </plain></SENT>
