<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> has mirrored the global increase in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the systematic review was to determine the level of association between diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Item selection, data extraction and critical appraisal were undertaken using standard procedures and independently verified by two researchers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>3 out of 10 potentially relevant studies were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> studies showed a level of association between diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, suggesting a near threefold increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in patients with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> compared to those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An association of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and severity of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> was found in males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> was more strongly linked to impairment in the cognitive domains of verbal learning and recent memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in patients with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> was found in the reviewed studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the relationship of severity of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> has not been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies with standardized measurements for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> are required to delineate this relationship and the role of other factors in this relationship </plain></SENT>
