<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Drug-naive subjects (n = 901) were enrolled into this 28-week, double-blind, parallel-group study if their glycosylated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c) (HbA(1c)) was &gt;7.5% but &lt;or=12% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects were randomized to receive either GLIM [4 mg once daily (OD) maximal], RSG (8 mg OD maximal) or RSG/GLIM <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> regimen A (4 mg/4 mg OD maximal) or RSG/GLIM <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> regimen B (8 mg/4 mg OD maximal) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were assessed for efficacy and safety every 4 weeks for the first 12 weeks of the study, and at weeks 20 and 28 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary efficacy endpoint was change in HbA(1c) from baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Key secondary endpoints included the proportion of patients achieving recommended HbA(1c) and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) targets; change from baseline in FPG, insulin, C-reactive protein (CRP), adiponectin, free fatty acids and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>; and percentage change in homeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Safety evaluations included adverse-event (AE) monitoring and clinical laboratory evaluations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At week 28, both RSG/GLIM <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> regimens significantly reduced HbA(1c) (mean +/- s.d.: -2.4 +/- 1.4% <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> regimen A; -2.5 +/- 1.4% <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> regimen B) to a greater extent than RSG (-1.8 +/- 1.5%) or GLIM (-1.7 +/- 1.4%) monotherapy (model-adjusted mean treatment difference, p &lt; 0.0001 vs. both RSG and GLIM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significantly more subjects achieved HbA(1c) target levels of &lt;or=6.5 and &lt;7% with either RSG/GLIM <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> regimen compared with RSG or GLIM alone (model-adjusted odds ratio, p &lt; 0.0001 for both comparisons) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similarly, a significantly greater reduction in FPG levels was observed in subjects treated with the RSG/GLIM <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> [mean +/- s.d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>(mg/dl): -69.5 +/- 57.5 FDC regimen A; -79.9 +/- 56.8 FDC regimen B) compared with RSG (-56.6 +/- 58.1) or GLIM (-42.2 +/- 66.1) monotherapy (model-adjusted mean treatment difference, p &lt; 0.0001 for both comparisons) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Improvement in CRP was also observed in subjects who were treated with a RSG/GLIM <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> or RSG monotherapy compared with GLIM monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RSG/GLIM <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> was generally well tolerated, with no new safety or tolerability issues identified from its monotherapy components, and a similar AE profile was observed across <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The most commonly reported AE was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e>, and the incidence of confirmed symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> (3.6-5.5%) was comparable among subjects treated with an RSG/GLIM <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> and GLIM monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Compared with RSG or GLIM monotherapy, the RSG/GLIM <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> improved glycaemic control with no significant increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>RSG/GLIM <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> provides an effective and well-tolerated treatment option for drug-naive individuals with T2DM </plain></SENT>
