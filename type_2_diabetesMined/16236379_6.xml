<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the prevalence of fasting <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> among Filipino women aged 40-79 years in the Philippines, Hawaii, and San Diego </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were obtained from the (1) Philippine National Nutrition Survey (1998), (2) Native Hawaiian Health Research Project (1997-2001), and (3) University of California San Diego Filipino Women's Health Study (1995-1999) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> after an 8h fast, blood pressure, and body mass index (BMI) were measured in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three regions; a 75 g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test was performed in San Diego and Hawaii </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The proportion of Filipinas with BMI &gt; or = 30 kg/m2 was higher in Hawaii (20%) compared to women in San Diego (9.3%) or the Philippines (5.2%, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fasting <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> prevalence (fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &gt; or = 126 mg/dl or fasting whole blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &gt; or = 110 mg/dl) did not differ among Filipinas in the Philippines (11.8%), San Diego (14.1%), and Hawaii (14.7%, p = 0.323) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevalence was similar among Filipinas in San Diego (31.6%) and Hawaii (24.9%, p = 0.79) </plain></SENT>
