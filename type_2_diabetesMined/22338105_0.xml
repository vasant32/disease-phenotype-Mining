<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of the current study was to evaluate the relationships between components of the complement system, metabolic risk factors, and family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in healthy South Asians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We recruited 119 healthy, first-degree relatives of South Asian subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SARs</z:e>) and 119 age- and sex-matched, healthy South Asian control subjects (SACs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fasting blood samples were taken for measurement of complement factors and standard metabolic risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SARs</z:e> were characterized by significantly higher properdin (mean concentration 12.6 [95% CI 12.2-13.1] mg/L vs. SACs 10.1 [9.7-10.5] mg/L, P &lt; 0.0001), factor B (187.4 [180.1-195.0] mg/L vs. SACs 165.0 [158.0-172.2] mg/L, P &lt; 0.0001), and SC5b-9 (92.0 [86.1-98.3] ng/mL vs. SACs 75.3 [71.9-78.9] ng/mL, P &lt; 0.0001) and increased homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (2.86 [2.61-3.13] vs. SACs 2.31 [2.05-2.61], P = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>C-reactive protein did not differ between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SARs</z:e> and SACs (P = 0.17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In subgroup analysis of 25 SARs and 25 SACs with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests, properdin, factor B, and SC5b-9 remained significantly elevated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SARs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Increased properdin and complement activation are associated with a family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in South Asians independent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, and predate the development of impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Properdin and SC5b-9 may be novel biomarkers for future risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in this high-risk population and warrant further investigation </plain></SENT>
