<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Little is known about the tissue-specific alterations of H6PDH and G6PT and their contributions to local <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> action in db/db mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We characterised the role of H6PDH and G6PT in pre-receptor metabolism of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi> by examining the production of the hepatic 11β-HSD1-H6PDH-G6PT system in db/db mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We observed that increased production of hepatic H6PDH in db/db mice was paralleled by upregulation of hepatic G6PT production and responded to elevated circulating levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16827">corticosterone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The reduction of H6PDH and 11β-HSD1 production by RU486 was accompanied by RU486-induced suppression of hepatic G6pt (also known as Slc37a4) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
