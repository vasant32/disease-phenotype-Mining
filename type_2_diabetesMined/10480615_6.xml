<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Phosphodiesterase (PDE) 3B is a key enzyme in the mediation of the antilipolytic action of insulin in adipocytes, and activation of this molecule results in a reduced output of free fatty acids (FFAs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An elevation of serum FFAs is known to cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in skeletal muscle and liver, which could be the primary cause of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To elucidate whether PDE3B is involved in this disease, we examined the PDE3B gene expression in epididymal fat tissues of <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> insulin-resistant diabetic KKAy mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also examined the effect of an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">insulin-sensitizing drug</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>, on this gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In adipose tissue of KKAy mice, PDE3B <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and its corresponding protein were reduced to 48 and 43% of those in C57BL/6J control mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Basal and insulin-stimulated membrane-bound PDE activities were also decreased to 50 and 36% of those in the controls, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">Pioglitazone</z:chebi> increased both PDE3B <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels by 1.8-fold of those in untreated KKAy mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Basal and insulin-induced membrane-bound PDE activities were also increased by 1.6- and 2.0-fold, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">Pioglitazone</z:chebi> reduced the elevated levels of serum insulin, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, FFAs, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> in KKAy mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, the reduced PDE3B gene expression in adipose tissues could be the primary event in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in KKAy mice, which was improved by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> possibly because of the restoration of the reduced PDE3B gene expression </plain></SENT>
