<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, A1C does not provide "real-time" information about individual hyperglycemic or hypoglycemic excursions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Real-time information provided by self-monitoring of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (SMBG) represents an important adjunct to A1C, because it can differentiate fasting, preprandial, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011998'>postprandial hyperglycemia</z:hpo>; detect glycemic excursions; identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>; and provide immediate feedback about the effect of food choices, physical activity, and medication on glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The importance of SMBG is widely appreciated and recommended as a core component of management in patients with type 1 or insulin-treated type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, as well as in diabetic pregnancy, for both women with pregestational type 1 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, SMBG in management of non-insulin-treated type 2 diabetic patients continues to be debated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results from clinical trials are inconclusive, and reviews fail to reach an agreement, mainly because of methodological problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Carefully designed large-scale studies on diverse patient populations with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with the follow-up period to investigate long-term effects of SMBG in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> should be carried out to clarify how to make the best use of SMBG, in which patients, and under what conditions </plain></SENT>
