<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genetic studies have clearly demonstrated that DNA polymorphisms within TCF7L2 confer the strongest known association with increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the impact of the TCF7L2 type-2-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-associated rs7903146 T allele on biological function and <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of human pancreatic islets is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Paraffin sections of pancreases from 187 brain-deceased donors (HbA(1c) &lt;6.5% [48 mmol/mol]) were used to genotype the TCF7L2 variant rs7903146 and evaluate its impact on islet <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and alpha and beta cell subpopulations following immunostaining for glucagon and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following islet isolation, we investigated the correlation between TCF7L2 genotype and in vitro islet functional variables from our in-house pancreatic database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TCF7L2 rs7903146 (T/T) was associated with reduced basal and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion in isolated human islets, and reduced islet density in whole pancreas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Morphological analysis demonstrated islet size was increased in T/T carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, rs7903146 was associated with an increased glucagon/C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> ratio, especially in bigger islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: The TCF7L2 variant rs7903146 risk allele is associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948379" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">impaired insulin secretion</z:e>, reduction of total islet number and quantitative as well as qualitative morphological changes in human islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Understanding how the TCF7L2 genotype modulates its activity and how TCF7L2 impacts the islet <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> may aid the design of new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
