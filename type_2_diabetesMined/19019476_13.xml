<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients taking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (MET) alone or with a sulphonylurea (SU) were randomly assigned to exenatide 5 microg then 10 microg twice-daily for 4 and 12 weeks, respectively, or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was baseline to endpoint HbA(1c) change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 466 patients (age 54+/-9 years, weight 68.7+/-11.2 kg, BMI 26.3+/-3.3 kg/m(2), and HbA(1c) 8.3+/-1.1%; mean+/-S.D.) were enrolled in the full analysis set </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endpoint HbA(1c) reduction (mean [95% CI]) with exenatide was superior to placebo (-1.2 [-1.3, -1.1]% vs. -0.4 [-0.5, -0.2]%, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>More exenatide- than placebo-treated patients achieved HbA(1c) &lt;or=7% (48% vs. 17%, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At endpoint, weight reduction was greater with exenatide (-1.2 [-1.5, -0.9]kg) than placebo (-0.1 [-0.3, 0.2]kg), p&lt;0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>Nausea</z:hpo>, generally mild-to-moderate, was the most common adverse event with exenatide (25% vs. 1% with placebo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> with exenatide and placebo were 36% and 9%, respectively (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hypoglycaemia</z:e> rates (events/patient-year) for patients taking exenatide with MET or MET and SU were 1.8 (0.9, 3.7) and 4.7 (3.5, 6.5), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Exenatide treatment improved glycaemic control in Asian patients with T2D and had a similar safety profile as in non-Asian patients </plain></SENT>
