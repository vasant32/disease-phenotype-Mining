<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined the association between parental history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and a type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> genetic risk score (GRS) in two cohort studies from Finland (population-based PPP-Botnia study) and the US (family-based Framingham Offspring Study) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean (95% CI) GRS increased from 16.8 (16.8-16.9) to 16.9 (16.8-17.1) to 17.1 (16.8-17.4) among PPP-Botnia participants with 0, 1, and 2 parents with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, respectively (p(trend)=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The trend was similar among Framingham Offspring but was not statistically significant (p=0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The meta-analyzed p value for trend from the two studies was 0.005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The very modest associations reported above suggest that the increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in offspring of parents with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is largely the result of shared environmental/lifestyle factors and/or hitherto unknown genetic factors </plain></SENT>
