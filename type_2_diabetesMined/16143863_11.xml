<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mammalian tissues express beta-isoforms of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24402">glycosphingolipids</z:chebi> and, among these, sulfatide (sulphated galactosylceramide) is present in the beta cells, and it is here that the short fatty acid chain (C16) isoform is predominately found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In vitro studies have shown that sulfatide preserves insulin crystals and facilitates insulin monomerisation under certain biochemical conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It also activates beta cell <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channels and moderates insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anti-sulfatide antibodies are seen in type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and immunological presentation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24402">glycosphingolipids</z:chebi> by the non-classical CD1 molecules has recently been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is via this mechanism that alpha-galactosylceramide and sulfatide are able to influence the innate immune system and inhibit <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo>, possibly through regulatory natural killer T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Administration of sulfatide substantially reduces the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> diabetic mice and prevents antigen-induced experimental autoimmune <z:mp ids='MP_0006082'>encephalomyelitis</z:mp> in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sulfatide has specific anti-inflammatory properties, increasing the number of CD3+CD25+ regulatory T cells and reducing production of several cytokines, including TNF-alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have low serum concentrations of sulfatide, and some animal models of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have low pancreatic expression of C16:0 sulfatide; administration of this increases insulin secretion and improves first-phase insulin response in <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> fatty rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="24402">Glycosphingolipids</z:chebi> in general, and sulfatide in particular, appear relevant to both type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
