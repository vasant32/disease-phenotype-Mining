<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a single-center, cross-sectional study conducted between 2003 and 2006 in Lausanne, Switzerland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Overall, 3,251 women and 2,937 men, aged 35-75 years, were assessed, of which 5,760 (93%) were free from <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and included in the current study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was assessed using seven different risk scores, including clinical data with or without biological data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Participants were considered to be eligible for primary prevention according to the thresholds provided for each score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results were then extrapolated to the Swiss population of the same sex and age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> increased with age in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of participants at high risk ranged between 1.6 and 24.9% in men and between 1.1 and 15.7% in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Extrapolated to the Swiss population of similar age, the overall number of participants at risk, and thus susceptible to intervention, ranged between 46,708 and 636,841 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, scores that included the same clinical variables led to a significantly different prevalence of participants at risk (4.2% [95% CI 3.4-5.0] vs. 12.8% [11.5-14.1] in men and 2.9% [2.4-3.6] vs. 6.0% [5.2-6.9] in women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS; The prevalence of participants at risk for developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> varies considerably according to the scoring system used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>To adequately prevent type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, risk-scoring systems must be validated for each population considered </plain></SENT>
