<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: An increase in the rate of hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production is the major determinant of fasting <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A better understanding of the signaling pathways and molecules that regulate hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism is therefore of great clinical importance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent studies suggest that an increase in vagal outflow to the liver leads to decreased hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production and reduced blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi>) is the major neurotransmitter of the vagus nerve and exerts its parasympathetic actions via activation of muscarinic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> receptors (mAChRs), we examined the potential metabolic relevance of hepatocyte mAChRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We initially demonstrated that the M(3) mAChR is the only mAChR subtype expressed by mouse liver/hepatocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To assess the physiological role of this receptor subtype in regulating hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> fluxes and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis in vivo, we used gene targeting and transgenic techniques to generate mutant mice lacking or overexpressing M(3) receptors in hepatocytes only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Strikingly, detailed in vivo phenotyping studies failed to reveal any significant metabolic differences between the M(3) receptor mutant mice and their control littermates, independent of whether the mice were fed regular or a high-fat diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the expression levels of genes for various key transcription factors, signaling molecules, and enzymes regulating hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> fluxes were not significantly altered in the M(3) receptor mutant mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This rather surprising finding suggests that the pronounced metabolic effects mediated by activation of hepatic vagal nerves are mediated by noncholinergic signaling pathways </plain></SENT>
