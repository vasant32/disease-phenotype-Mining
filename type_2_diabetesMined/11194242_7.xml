<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To establish <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rates and life expectancies of and risk factors for mortality in insulin-treated diabetic individuals living in Canterbury, New Zealand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Insulin-treated diabetic subjects (n = 1,008) on the Canterbury <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Registry were tracked over 9 years, and their vital status was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> rates were standardized using direct and indirect methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazard regression was used to model the effects of demographic and clinical covariates on survival time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At study entry, age ranged from 2.9 to 92.7 years, with mean 48.7 +/- 20.4 years; age at diagnosis was 0.2-88.9 years, mean 34.5 +/- 20.0 years; and duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 0.1-58.5 years, mean 14.0 +/- 10.6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 303 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in 7,372 person-years of follow-up with a standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of 2.6 (95% CI 2.4-3.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Relative mortality was greatest for those aged 30-39 years (SMR 9.2 [4.8-16.2]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate for the diabetic cohort standardized against the Segi world standard population was 16.2 per 1,000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Attained age, sex, and clinical subtype were significant predictors of mortality The SMR for subjects with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> &lt;30 years was 3.7 (CI 2.7-5.0), 2.2 (1.8-2.6) for those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> &gt; or =30 years, and 3.1 (2.5-3.7) for subjects suspected of having latent autoimmune <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in adulthood or insulin-treated type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Life expectancy was reduced for both sexes at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Mortality rates for insulin-treated diabetic individuals remain high, resulting in shortened life spans relative to the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Marked differences in mortality exist between clinical groups of subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further research is needed to improve <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> classification and to clarify differences in health outcomes </plain></SENT>
