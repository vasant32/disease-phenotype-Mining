<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess whether high salt intake, measured by 24-h urinary <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> excretion, is an independent risk factor for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We followed prospectively 932 Finnish men and 1,003 women aged 35-64 years with complete data on 24-h urinary <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> excretion and other study parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hazard ratios for the incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were estimated for different levels of 24-h urinary <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> excretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 18.1 years, there were 129 incident cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The multivariate-adjusted (age, sex, study year, body mass index, physical activity, systolic blood pressure, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive drug</z:chebi> treatment, education, smoking and coffee, alcohol, fruit, vegetable, sausage, bread and saturated fat consumption) hazard ratio for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for the highest vs combined lower quartiles of 24-h urinary <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> excretion was 2.05 (95% CI, 1.43-2.96) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This positive association persisted in non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects, in normotensive and hypertensive subjects, as well as in men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">Potassium</z:chebi> excretion was not associated with the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: High <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> intake predicted the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, independently of other risk factors including physical inactivity, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results provide direct evidence of the harmful effects of high salt intake in the adult population, although the confounding effect of other dietary factors cannot be fully excluded </plain></SENT>
