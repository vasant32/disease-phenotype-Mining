<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we provide evidence that enhanced insulin release plays an important role in the activation of this gene by <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> (30 vs. 3 mmol/l) increased ACCI <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels approximately 4-fold and stimulated ACCI (pII) promoter activity &gt;30-fold in MIN6 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The latter effect was completely suppressed by blockade of insulin release or of insulin receptor signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, added insulin substantially, but not completely, mimicked the effects of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, suggesting that intracellular metabolites of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> may also contribute to transcriptional stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mutational analysis of the ACCI promoter, and antibody microinjection, revealed that the effect of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> required <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15889">sterol</z:chebi> response element binding protein (SREBP)-1c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, adenoviral transduction with dominant-negative-acting SREBP1c blocked ACCI gene induction, whereas constitutively active SREBP1c increased ACCI <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> also stimulated SREBP1c transcription, although this effect was independent of insulin release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> regulates ACCI gene expression in the beta-cell by complex mechanisms that may involve the covalent modification of SREBP1c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, overexpression of SREBP1c also decreased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin release, implicating SREBP1c induction in beta-cell lipotoxicity in some forms of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
