<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We recently found that serum dehydroepiandrosterone <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> (DHEA-S) concentration correlated inversely with the degree of urinary albumin excretion in a cross-sectional study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore performed an observational study to investigate the relationship between serum DHEA-S concentrations and changes in urinary albumin excretion in male patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> to answer the question as to whether DHEA is a causal rather than simply coincidental intermediate linking urinary albumin excretion to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The relationship between serum DHEA-S concentration and changes in urinary albumin excretion was investigated in 207 consecutive male patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Baseline serum DHEA-S concentration and urinary albumin excretion were measured in 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 12 months, urinary albumin excretion was measured and any changes in urinary albumin excretion were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into tertiles according to DHEA-S concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Greater changes in urinary albumin excretion were seen in patients with low DHEA-S concentration (29.6+/-7.6mg/g <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>) than in patients with high DHEA-S concentration (5.1+/-3.6mg/g <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, P=0.0091) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An inverse correlation was observed between serum DHEA-S concentration and changes in urinary albumin excretion (r=-0.193, P=0.0052) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that HbA1c (beta=0.241, P=0.0009), and serum DHEA-S concentration (beta=-0.195, P=0.0054) were independent determinants of changes in urinary albumin excretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, serum DHEA-S concentration was inversely correlated with changes in urinary albumin excretion, which may indicate causality in the increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> mortality in male patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and low DHEA-S concentration </plain></SENT>
