<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the long-term effects of insulin lispro on inducing lispro-specific, insulin-specific, and cross-reactive (reactive with both insulin lispro and human insulin) antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A multinational, multicenter combination of controlled and noncontrolled, open-label studies of 4.5 years' duration was designed to evaluate the long-term immunologic profile of subcutaneously administered insulin lispro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 1,221 patients (men and women; 12-81 years of age) with type 1 or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Circulating anti-insulin antibodies were measured using radioimmunoassays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Insulin-specific and lispro-specific antibody responses were within the background noise levels of the assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significant elevations of antibody were confined to a cross-reactive antibody response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Antibody levels resulting from prior exposure to long- and short-acting insulins changed little after transfer to insulin lispro and remained within or near the baseline levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>De novo exposure to insulin lispro resulted in increases in cross-reactive but not insulin- or lispro-specific antibody levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cross-reactive insulin antibodies developed more readily in patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than in those with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Long-term antibody responses tended to decrease over time and returned to baseline or near-baseline levels by the end of the long-term studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No evidence of an anamnestic antibody response could be found in individuals treated intermittently with insulin lispro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The immunogenic profile of patients treated with insulin lispro was comparable to that of patients treated with recombinant human insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Inductions of significant levels of specific or cross-reactive antibodies were not observed in patients who had received insulin previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No significant antibody-dependent increases in insulin dosage requirements were noted in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0571622" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">insulin allergy</z:e> was not different from that in patients treated with recombinant regular human insulin </plain></SENT>
