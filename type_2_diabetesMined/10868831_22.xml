<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> was newly diagnosed among 5% of the subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The number of stressful events was positively associated with the prevalence of hitherto undetected <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The highest quintile had a 1.6-fold (95% CI 1.0-2.6) increased probability of undetected <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with the remaining four quintiles (P&lt;0.05 by logistical regression analysis adjusted for age and sex) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This increased probability remained significant after additional adjustment for family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, heavy alcohol consumption, physical activity, and low level of education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of stressful events was weakly positively associated with waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) (men, P&lt;0.01; women, P = 0.05 by multiple regression analysis adjusted for age) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The age- and sex-adjusted association between stress and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was only marginally reduced by adding the WHR into the logistical regression model (odds ratio 1.5 [0.9-2.4]; P = 0.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These cross-sectional findings are partially consistent with Bj√∂rntorp's theory that stressful life events, which indicate <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038443" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychological stress</z:e>, are indeed associated with undetected type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and with visceral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, in this white middle-aged population, visceral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> does not seem to be the main link between stress and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
