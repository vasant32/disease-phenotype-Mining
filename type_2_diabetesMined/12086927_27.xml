<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> phosphatase SHIP2 is a potent negative regulator of insulin signaling and sensitivity in vivo and is thus a good candidate gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report the presence of SHIP2 gene mutations associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in rats and humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The R1142C mutation specifically identified in Goto-Kakizaki (GK) and spontaneously hypertensive rat strains disrupts a potential class II ligand for Src homology (SH)-3 domain and slightly impairs insulin signaling in cell culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In humans, a deletion identified in the SHIP2 3' untranslated region (UTR) of type 2 diabetic subjects includes a motif implicated in the control of protein synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In cell culture, the deletion results in reporter <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> and protein overexpression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, genotyping of a cohort of type 2 diabetic and control subjects showed a significant association between the deletion and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Altogether, our results show that mutations in the SHIP2 gene contribute to the genetic susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in rats and humans </plain></SENT>
