<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Subjects were selected from the Inter99 cohort, a longitudinal population-based study of approximately 6,600 Danes in a nested case-control design with the primary outcome of 5-year conversion to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nondiabetic subjects, aged &gt;or=39 years, with BMI &gt;or=25 kg/m(2) at baseline were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Baseline fasting serum samples from 160 individuals who developed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and from 472 who did not were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An ultrasensitive immunoassay was used to measure of 58 candidate biomarkers in multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-associated pathways, along with six routine clinical variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Statistical learning methods and permutation testing were used to select the most informative biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Risk model performance was estimated using a validated bootstrap bias-correction procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A model using six biomarkers (adiponectin, C-reactive protein, ferritin, interleukin-2 receptor A, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and insulin) was developed for assessing an individual's 5-year risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This model has a bootstrap-estimated area under the curve of 0.76, which is greater than that for A1C, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, fasting serum insulin, BMI, sex-adjusted waist circumference, a model using fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin, and a noninvasive clinical model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A model incorporating six circulating biomarkers provides an objective and quantitative estimate of the 5-year risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, performs better than single risk indicators and a noninvasive clinical model, and provides better stratification than fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> alone </plain></SENT>
