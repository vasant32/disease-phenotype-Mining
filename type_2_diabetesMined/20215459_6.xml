<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine how childhood overweight, in conjunction with other life course weight characteristics, relates to the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Among 109,172 women in the Nurses' Health Study II, body fatness at ages 5, 10, and 20 years was assessed by recall using 9-level pictorial diagrams (somatotypes) representing extreme thinness (category 1) to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (category 9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recalled weights at age 18 years and adulthood were used to derive BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Self-reported cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were confirmed by supplementary questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Somatotypes at ages 5 and 10 years were positively associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk (P(trend) &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The adjusted relative risk (RR) of women with somatotype &gt;or=6 (vs. 2) at age 5 years was 2.19 (95% CI 1.79-2.67) and at age 10 years was 2.57 (2.20-3.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increases in size by somatotype or by <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> since age 18 were associated with increased risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with women who were never overweight at any age, women who were overweight as an adult (BMI &gt;25 kg/m(2)) but not previously had an adjusted RR of 8.23 (7.41-9.15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The adjusted RR was 15.10 (13.21-17.26) for women who were also overweight at age 10 (somatotype &gt;or=5) and 18 (BMI &gt;25 kg/m(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Increased childhood size was not associated with risk among women who did not continue to be overweight in adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mp ids='MP_0001264'>Increased body size</z:mp> starting from childhood is associated with a greater risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, women who become lean in adulthood do not have an increased risk </plain></SENT>
