<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study evaluated whether treatment with salsalate, a traditional anti-inflammatory medication, would improve insulin action in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> non-diabetic individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel trial conducted at the inpatient clinical research unit of the NIDKK (Phoenix, AZ, USA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Participants were 54 adults (18 to 45 years of age) with BMI &gt;or= 30 kg/m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The intervention was salsalate (3 g/day, n = 28) or identical placebo (n = 26) for 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The allocation was kept concealed by giving the investigator only a number corresponding to a vial of placebo or salsalate sequentially randomised in blocks by sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Main outcomes were changes in insulin action assessed as rate of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal (R (d)) by euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp (insulin infusion rate 40 mU m(-2) min(-1)) and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance by 75 g OGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study was completed by 47 participants, of which 40 were analysed (salsalate n = 22, placebo n = 18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Salsalate treatment resulted in decreased fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration (mean [SD]; 4.83 [0.28] vs 5.11 [0.33] mmol/l, p = 0.001) and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> AUC during the OGTT (p = 0.01), and in increased R (d) (20 [8] vs 18 [6] micromol [kg estimated metabolic body size](-1) min(-1), p = 0.002), while there was no significant change in these variables with placebo (p &gt; 0.3 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The effect of salsalate on R (d) disappeared (p = 0.9) after normalising to increased insulin concentrations (701 [285] vs 535 [201] pmol/l, p &lt; 0.0001) measured during the clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No side effects of salsalate were observed during the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering potential of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30762">salicylates</z:chebi> appears to be due to effects on insulin concentration rather than improved insulin action </plain></SENT>
