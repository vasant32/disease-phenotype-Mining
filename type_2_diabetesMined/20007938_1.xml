<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE An association of the C-857T polymorphism of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) gene promoter region with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> levels has been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to evaluate the relationship between the TNF-alpha-C-857T polymorphism and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> levels according to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> treatment in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS DNA was obtained from 322 Japanese subjects (160 male and 162 female) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and TNF-alpha-C-857T polymorphisms were determined by direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> was measured by a direct method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS Although serum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> levels were significantly higher in the T carriers (C/T + T/T) than in the non-T carriers (C/C) (3.14 +/- 0.86 vs. 2.89 +/- 0.75 mmol/l, P &lt; 0.05), there was no difference in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> levels between the non-T carriers and the T carriers in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi>-untreated subjects (2.87 +/- 0.73 vs. 2.89 +/- 0.76 mmol/l, NS), whereas in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi>-treated subjects, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> levels were significantly higher in the T carriers than in the non-T carriers (3.43 +/- 0.89 vs. 2.90 +/- 0.78 mmol/l, P = 0.0007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels between the non-T carriers and the T carriers in both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi>-treated and -untreated subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The percent decrease in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> levels after administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> was significantly smaller in the T carriers compared with the non-T carriers (27.6 vs. 36.4%, P = 0.031) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS The mutant allele of the C-857T promoter polymorphism of the TNF-alpha gene may predispose to resistance to the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>-lowering effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> and could be one of the markers used to predict the efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
