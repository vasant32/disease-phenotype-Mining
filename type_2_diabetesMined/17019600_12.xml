<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relation between coffee consumption and risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) has been examined in many studies, but the issue remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to assess the association between coffee consumption and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> mortality among patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively followed 3,837 randomly ascertained Finnish patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> aged 25 to 74 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Coffee consumption and other study parameters were determined at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The International Classification of Diseases was used to identify CHD, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> cases using computerised record linkage to the national <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The associations between coffee consumption at baseline and risk of total, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>, CHD, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mortality were analysed by using Cox proportional hazards models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the average follow-up of 20.8 years, 1,471 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were recorded, of which 909 were coded as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>, 598 as CHD and 210 as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The respective multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios in participants who drank 0-2, 3-4, 5-6, and &gt; or =7 cups of coffee daily were 1.00, 0.77, 0.68 and 0.70 for total mortality (P&lt;0.001 for trend), 1.00, 0.79, 0.70 and 0.71 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> mortality (P=0.006 for trend), 1.00, 0.78, 0.70 and 0.63 for CHD mortality (p=0.01 for trend), and 1.00, 0.77, 0.64 and 0.90 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mortality (p=0.12 for trend) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In this large prospective study we found that in type 2 diabetic patients coffee drinking is associated with reduced total, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> and CHD mortality </plain></SENT>
