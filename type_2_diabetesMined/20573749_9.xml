<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> have been associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction, but it is debated whether this is a primary factor in the pathogenesis of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To test the concept that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction is secondary to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, we employed the unique model of prolonged fasting in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prolonged fasting is a physiologic condition in which muscular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> develops in the presence of increased free fatty acid (FFA) levels, increased fat oxidation and low <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is therefore anticipated that skeletal muscle <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> function is maintained to accommodate increased fat oxidation unless factors secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> exert negative effects on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: While in a respiration chamber, twelve healthy males were subjected to a 60 h fast and a 60 h <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fed condition in a randomized crossover design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Afterward, insulin sensitivity was assessed using a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> function was quantified ex vivo in permeabilized muscle fibers using high-resolution respirometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Indeed, FFA levels were increased approximately ninefold after 60 h of fasting in healthy male subjects, leading to elevated intramuscular <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels and decreased muscular insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite an increase in whole-body fat oxidation, we observed an overall reduction in both coupled state 3 respiration and maximally uncoupled respiration in permeabilized skeletal muscle fibers, which could not be explained by changes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm that the insulin-resistant state has secondary negative effects on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Given the low insulin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels after prolonged fasting, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> and insulin action per se can be excluded as underlying mechanisms, pointing toward elevated plasma FFA and/or intramuscular fat accumulation as possible causes for the observed reduction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> capacity </plain></SENT>
