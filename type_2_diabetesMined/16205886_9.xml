<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In five DPS centres, 321 subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (intervention group, n=163; control group, n=158) had their PAI-1 and fibrinogen levels measured at baseline and at the 1-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Additional 3-year follow-up assessments were carried out in a sample of 97 subjects in one of the DPS centres (Turku) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The intervention programme included an intensive lifestyle intervention aiming at weight reduction, healthy diet and increased physical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the first intervention year, PAI-1 decreased by 31% in the intervention group but showed no change in the control group (p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the Turku subgroup, the decrease in PAI-1 persisted throughout the 3-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Changes in PAI-1 were associated with the number of lifestyle changes made during the first year (p=0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Weight reduction was the most important factor explaining the decrease in PAI-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Changes in fibrinogen levels did not differ between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In addition to the previously reported reduction in the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in DPS participants with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo>, the intensive dietary and exercise intervention had beneficial long-term effects on fibrinolysis as indicated by the reduced levels of PAI-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that elevated PAI-1 levels in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> are mostly reversible by lifestyle changes, especially those geared to weight reduction </plain></SENT>
