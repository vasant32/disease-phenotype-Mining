<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 60 people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 30 men and 30 women aged 52.2 +/- 6.32 years, were divided randomly into six groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Groups 1, 2, and 3 consumed 1, 3, or 6 g of cinnamon daily, respectively, and groups 4, 5, and 6 were given placebo capsules corresponding to the number of capsules consumed for the three levels of cinnamon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cinnamon was consumed for 40 days followed by a 20-day washout period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 40 days, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three levels of cinnamon reduced the mean fasting serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (18-29%), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> (23-30%), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (7-27%), and total cholesterol (12-26%) levels; no significant changes were noted in the placebo groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Changes in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> were not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrate that intake of 1, 3, or 6 g of cinnamon per day reduces serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, and total cholesterol in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and suggest that the inclusion of cinnamon in the diet of people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> will reduce risk factors associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
