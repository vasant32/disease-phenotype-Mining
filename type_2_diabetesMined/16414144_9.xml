<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To explore whether these genetic variants contribute to the susceptibility for type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) in a Chinese population, a total of 184 T2DM cases and 279 matched healthy controls were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis and DNA sequencing were used to determine the variants of mtDNA (including T16189C, G3316A, T3394C, A14693G, A3243G and C1310T) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Some of them were further analyzed by mfold or tRNA-scan-SE software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A homoplastic A14693G, for the first time, was found in 4 of 184 Chinese cases, the frequency of A14693G and T3394C was 2.17% and 2.72%, respectively, in patients but not in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Secondary structure prediction revealed that there were obvious conformational changes in T3394C mutant ND1 versus <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> and A14693G mutant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29175">tRNA(Glu)</z:chebi> protein versus <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp>, providing additional clues to the disease pathogenesis although A3243G and C1310T mutations were not detected in any patients in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 16189 variant among type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was more prevalent than in controls (36.9% versus 28.7%, P=0.039), and stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that the 16189 variant was an independent factor contributing to HOMA-IR (R(2)=0.043, P=0.037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that the mutations of T3394C and A14693G may contribute to genetic predisposition to T2DM, with the T16189C variant being associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
