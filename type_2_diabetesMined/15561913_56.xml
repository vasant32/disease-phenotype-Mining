<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study characterizes the high-fat diet-fed mouse as a model for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Female C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat diet (58% energy by fat) or a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> diet (11% fat) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Body weight was higher in mice fed the high-fat diet already after the first week, due to higher dietary intake in combination with lower metabolic efficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Circulating <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> increased after 1 week on high-fat diet and remained elevated at a level of approximately 1 mmol/l throughout the 12-month study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, circulating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020459" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">insulin increased</z:e> progressively by time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> challenge revealed a severely compromised insulin response in association with marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> already after 1 week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To illustrate the usefulness of this model for the development of new treatment, mice were fed an orally active inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (LAF237) in the drinking water (0.3 mg/ml) for 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This normalized <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, as judged by an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test, in association with augmented insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the high-fat diet-fed C57BL/6J mouse model is a robust model for IGT and early type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, which may be used for studies on pathophysiology and development of new treatment </plain></SENT>
