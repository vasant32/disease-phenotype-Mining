<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Randomized, controlled, double-blind, parallel-group study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-four type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients on oral anti-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> medication consumed 2×200mL/day of a DSF (Diasip(®)) or an isocaloric standard, fiber-containing formula for 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi> responses were assessed at baseline and after 4 weeks by iAUC and (delta) peak <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi> response was significantly lower in the DSF group after first intake and remained significantly lower after 4 weeks use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postprandial insulin, fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24103">fructosamine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels did not differ between groups after 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Within the standard group, fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and HOMA(IR) significantly increased over the intervention period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Changes in body weight between groups were significantly different, with an increase in the standard group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both products were equally well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Superior <z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi> control by DSF was maintained after 4 weeks use, showing that this formula has added value with respect to <z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi> control for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients compared to a standard, fiber-containing formula </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The observed effects on body weight, fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and HOMA(IR) may further support the use of a DSF </plain></SENT>
