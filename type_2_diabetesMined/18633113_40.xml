<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether plasma fetuin-A levels predict the incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a large prospective, population-based study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A case-cohort study within the European Prospective Investigation into <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> and Nutrition (EPIC)-Potsdam study comprising 27,548 subjects was designed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We randomly selected a subcohort of 2,500 individuals of whom 2,164 were <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> free at baseline and had anamnestic, anthropometrical, and metabolic data for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 849 incident diabetic case subjects identified in the full cohort during 7 years of follow-up, 703 remained for analyses after similar exclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Plasma fetuin-A levels were positively associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk after adjustment for age (relative risk [RR] for extreme quintiles 1.75 [95% CI 1.32-2.31]; RR for 10 mug/ml 1.04 [1.03-1.06]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The association remained significant after adjustment for sex, BMI, waist circumference, and lifestyle risk factors (RR for 10 mug/ml 1.03 [1.01-1.06]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adjustment for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, A1C, gamma-glutamyltransferase, or high-sensitivity C-reactive protein or mutual adjustment for these biomarkers did not appreciably change this result (RR for 10 mug/ml full adjusted model 1.05 [1.02-1.07]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, fetuin-A was associated with increased <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk particularly in individuals with elevated plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that fetuin-A is an independent risk factor of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
