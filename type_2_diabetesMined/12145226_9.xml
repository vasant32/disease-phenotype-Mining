<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We investigated the relationship between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD) in 40 type 2 diabetic patients and 40 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diabetic patients with CAD determined by coronary angiography were consecutively recruited, whereas the control subjects were recruited from among diabetic outpatients without CAD at the same institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> was measured in both carotid arteries using B-mode ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> was significantly greater in the diabetic patients than in the control subjects (1.27 +/- 0.07 vs. 1.03 +/- 0.04 mm, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> was associated with CAD by logistic regression analysis using <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> independent variables (P = 0.062) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When the 40 patients with CAD were divided into a group of 20 patients with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and another 20 patients without CABG, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> was significantly greater in the CABG group than in the non-CABG group (1.47 +/- 0.11 vs. 1.07 +/- 0.07 mm, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the presence of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> implies a high probability of coronary involvement in Japanese nonobese subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
