<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> is considered to play a crucial role in the regulation of food intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On this background, we hypothesized that a short-term reduction of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values acutely increases food intake in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: To test this hypothesis, 12 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were examined twice, once during a euglycemic (5.0 mmol/l) clamp experiment and another time during a hyperglycemic (10.5 mmol/l) clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The experiments were performed in a single-blind fashion with the order of conditions balanced across patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On both clamp conditions, insulin was infused at a constant rate of 2.5 mU/kg per min for 125 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Simultaneously, a <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> solution was infused at a variable rate to achieve target glycemic levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During the final 30 min of the clamps, the patients were allowed to eat as much as they liked from a standard breakfast buffet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with the hyperglycemic condition, the patients ingested on average 25 +/- 10% more energy during euglycemia (645 +/- 75 vs. 483 +/- 37 kcal; P = 0.029) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The increased energy intake during euglycemia was equally distributed across macronutrient components, i.e., during euglycemia the patients ate more carbohydrates (+27.1 +/- 11.4%; P = 0.037), fat (+22.5 +/- 10.0%; P = 0.046), and proteins (+25.2 +/- 11.2%; P = 0.046) than during <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Circulating levels of insulin, amylin, leptin, ghrelin, and glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 did not differ between the euglycemic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> clamp, excluding a major contribution of these hormones to the difference in food intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Summing up the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> administered intravenously and the food ingested yielded a remarkably similar total energy influx in both conditions (794 +/- 64 vs. 790 +/- 53 kcal; P = 0.961) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Together our data suggest that total energy supply to the organism is tightly regulated on a short-term basis independent of the route of influx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, it can be hypothesized that euglycemia stimulated or that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> suppressed food intake at the subsequent buffet meal in our type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Regardless of these different interpretations, our data indicate an important regulatory role of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> for food intake in type 2 diabetic patients that is of considerable clinical relevance </plain></SENT>
