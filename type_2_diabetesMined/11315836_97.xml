<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 23 diabetic patients (age 30-70 years BMI &lt; 36 kg/m2) who being treated with a stable dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> were randomly assigned to receive either placebo (n = 11) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (45 mg/day) (n = 12) for 16 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Before and after 16 weeks of treatment, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects received a 75-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) and hepatic peripheral insulin sensitivity was measured with a two-step euglycemic insulin (40 and 160 mU x min(-1) x m(-2) clamp performed with 3-[3H]<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and indirect calorimetry HbA1c measured monthly throughout the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 16 weeks of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> treatment, the fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG; 184 +/- 15 to 135 +/- 11 mg/dl, P &lt; 0.01), mean plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> during OGTT(293 +/- 12 to 225 +/- 14 mg/dl, P &lt; 0.01), and HbA1c (8.9 +/- 0.3 to 7.2 +/- 0.5%, P &lt; 0.01 ) decreased significantly without change in fasting or <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin/C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fasting plasma free fatty acid (FFA; 647 +/- 39 to 478 +/- 49) microEq/l, P &lt; 0.01) and mean plasma FFA during OGTT (485 +/- 30 to 347 +/- 33 microEq/l, P &lt; 0.01) decreased significantly after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Before and after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> treatment, basal endogenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> prodution (EGP) and FPG were strongly correlated (r = 0.67, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EGP during the first insulin clamp step was significantly decreased after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> treatment (P &lt; 0.05) whereas insulin-stimulated total and nonoxidative <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal during the second insulin clamp was increased (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The change in FPG was related to the change in basal EGP, EGP during the first insulin clamp step, and total <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal during the second insulin clamp step </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The change in mean plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration during the OGGTT was strongly related to the change in total body <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposl during the second insulin clamp step </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> therapy in type 2 diabetic patients decreases lasting and postprandial plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels by improving hepatic and peripheral (muscle) tissue sensitivity to insulin </plain></SENT>
