<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Activation of the renin-angiotensin system (<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>) is reported to contribute to intrarenal hemodynamic abnormality in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined whether <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> blockade by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3380">captopril</z:chebi> induces intrarenal hemodynamic changes in normotensive patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The patients ranged in age from 40 to 65 years (20 men and 20 women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 15 age- and sex-matched healthy individuals served as control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Resistive index (RI) of interlobar arteries was examined by duplex Doppler sonography before and after the oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3380">captopril</z:chebi> (25 mg) test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, no significant differences in RI values or plasma renin activity (PRA) were seen between the patients and healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In healthy subjects, the RI values after the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3380">captopril</z:chebi> test were significantly higher than baseline values (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, both with normoalbuminuria and <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp>, RI values after the test were significantly lower than baseline values (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were significant negative correlations between DeltaRI value and HbA1c (r = -0.458, P &lt; 0.005) and between DeltaRI value and baseline PRA in diabetic patients (r = -0.339, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multiple regression analysis showed that HbA1c and baseline PRA significantly and independently affected the magnitude of decrease in RI values after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3380">captopril</z:chebi> administration in diabetic patients (R2 = 0.391, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the intrarenal <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> may be activated in diabetic patients, that such activation may be affected by poor glycemic control, and that blockade of <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> activation by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitor</z:chebi> reduces intrarenal vascular resistance in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The results emphasize the beneficial effects of ACE inhibition in improving intrarenal hemodynamics in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
