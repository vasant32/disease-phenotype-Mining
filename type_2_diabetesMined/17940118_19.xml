<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We previously demonstrated that 1) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> impairs and 2) sex influences insulin sensitivity of protein metabolism, while 3) poor glycemic control in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> accelerates protein turnover in daily fed-fasted states </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> alters the insulin sensitivity of protein metabolism and that sex modulates it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Hyperinsulinemic ( approximately 570 pmol/l), euglycemic (5.5 mmol/l), and isoaminoacidemic (kept at postabsorptive concentrations) clamps were performed in 17 hyperglycemic type 2 diabetic subjects and 23 subjects without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> matched for age and body composition, after 7 days on a inpatient, protein-controlled, isoenergetic diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> and leucine kinetics were determined using tracers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, postabsorptive (baseline) glycemia was 8-9 mmol/l, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production (R(a)) and disposal (R(d)) were elevated, and once clamped, endogenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> R(a) remained greater and R(d) was less (P &lt; 0.05) than in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Baseline leucine kinetics did not differ despite higher insulin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The latter was an independent predictor of leucine flux within each sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With clamp, total flux increased less (P = 0.016) in type 2 diabetic men, although protein breakdown decreased equally ( approximately 20%) in male groups but less in female groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Whereas protein synthesis increased in male control subjects and in both female groups, it did not in male subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In men, homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> predicted 44%, and, in women, waist-to-hip ratio predicted 40% of the change in synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: During our clamp, men with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have greater <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> of protein metabolism than that conferred by excess <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> itself, whereas women do not </plain></SENT>
