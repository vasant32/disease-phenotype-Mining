<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To test whether dietary AGEs play a role in the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mice fed high-fat diets, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> C57/BL6 mice were randomly assigned to high-fat diets (35% g fat), either high (HAGE-HF group; 995.4 units/mg AGE) or low (by 2.4-fold LAGE-HF group; 329.6 units/mg AGE) in AGE content for 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Age-matched C57/BL6 and db/db(++) mice fed regular diet (5% g fat, 117.4 units/mg AGE) served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 6 months, 75% of HAGE-HF mice were diabetic and exhibited higher body weight (P &lt; 0.001), fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.001), insulin (P &lt; 0.001), and serum AGEs (P &lt; 0.01) than control mice, while none of the LAGE-HF mice were diabetic despite a similar rise in body weight and plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The HAGE-HF group displayed markedly impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin responses during <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests and euglycemic and hyperglycemic clamps and altered pancreatic islet structure and function compared with those of LAGE-HF mice, in which findings resembled those of control mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The HAGE-HF group had more visceral fat (by two- and fourfold) and more AGE-modified fat (by two- and fivefold) than LAGE-HF and control mice, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the HAGE-HF group, plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33023">8-isoprostane</z:chebi> was higher (P &lt; 0.01) and adiponectin lower (P &lt; 0.001) than control mice, while in the LAGE-HF group, these were more modestly affected (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during prolonged high-fat feeding are linked to the excess AGEs/advanced lipoxidation end products inherent in fatty diets </plain></SENT>
