<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the dose-related pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of a single preprandial oral dose of repaglinide in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 16 Caucasian men with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> participated in two placebo-controlled double-blind randomized cross-over studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomized to receive a single oral dose of repaglinide (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg in study 1 and 4.0 mg in study 2) or placebo (both studies) administered 15 min before the first of two sequential identical standard meals (breakfast and lunch) that were 4 h apart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During each of the study days, which were 1 week apart, blood samples were taken at frequent intervals over a period of approximately 8 h for measurement of plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, and repaglinide concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the first meal period (0-240 min), administration of repaglinide reduced significantly the area under the curve (AUC) for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration and significantly increased the AUC for insulin levels, C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels, and the insulin secretion rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results, compared with those of administering placebo, were dose dependent and log linear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effect of repaglinide administration on insulin secretion was most pronounced in the early prandial period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Within 30 min, it caused a relative increase in insulin secretion of up to 150% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During the second meal period (240-480 min), there was no difference between repaglinide and placebo administration in the AUC for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration, C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> concentration, and the estimated insulin secretion rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A single dose of repaglinide (0.5-4.0 mg) before breakfast improves insulin secretion and reduces prandial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> dose-dependently Administration of repaglinide had no effect on insulin secretion with the second meal, which was consumed 4 h after breakfast </plain></SENT>
