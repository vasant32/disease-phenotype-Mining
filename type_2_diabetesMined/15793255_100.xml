<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">Troglitazone</z:chebi>, an insulin-sensitizing agent, was used initially but was discontinued during the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">Troglitazone</z:chebi> therapy was compared with other DPP interventions, considering both the short-term "in-trial" results and the longer-term results after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> were discontinued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From 1996 to 1998, participants were randomly assigned to treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (n = 587), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> (n = 585), double placebo (n = 582), or intensive lifestyle intervention (ILS) (n = 589) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because of concern regarding its liver toxicity, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> arm was discontinued in June 1998, after which follow-up of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants continued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the mean 0.9 year (range 0.5-1.5 years) of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> treatment, the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence rate was 3.0 cases/100 person-years, compared with 12.0, 6.7, and 5.1 cases/100 person-years in the placebo, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, and ILS participants (P &lt; 0.001, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> vs. placebo; P = 0.02, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> vs. <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>; P = 0.18, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> vs. ILS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> was in part due to improved insulin sensitivity with maintenance of insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During the 3 years after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> withdrawal, the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence rate was almost identical to that of the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">Troglitazone</z:chebi>, therefore, markedly reduced the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during its limited period of use, but this action did not persist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Whether other thiazolidinedione drugs used for longer periods can safely prevent <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
