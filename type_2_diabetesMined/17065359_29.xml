<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The common missense single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) K121Q in the ectoenzyme nucleotide <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">pyrophosphate</z:chebi> phosphodiesterase (ENPP1) gene has recently been associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Italian, U.S., and South-Asian populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A three-SNP haplotype, including K121Q, has also been associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in French and Austrian populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We set out to confirm these findings in several large samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We genotyped the haplotype K121Q (rs1044498), rs1799774, and rs7754561 in 8,676 individuals of European ancestry with and without type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, in 1,900 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and 930 lean individuals of European ancestry from the U.S. and Poland, and in 1,101 African-American individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neither the K121Q missense polymorphism nor the putative risk haplotype were significantly associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two SNPs showed suggestive evidence of association in a meta-analysis of our European ancestry samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These SNPs were rs7754561 with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (odds ratio for the G-allele, 0.85 [95% CI 0.78-0.92], P = 0.00003) and rs1799774 with BMI (homozygotes of the delT-allele, 0.6 [0.42-0.88], P = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, these findings are not supported by other studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We did not observe a reproducible association between these three ENPP1 variants and BMI or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
