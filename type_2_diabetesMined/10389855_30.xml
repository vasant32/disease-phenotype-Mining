<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma is a major regulator of adipogenesis and insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The PPAR-gamma gene generates two isoforms through alternative splicing, PPAR-gamma1 and -gamma2, the latter having an additional stretch of 28 amino acids at its <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29318,29339">NH2</z:chebi>-terminus in the ligand-independent activation domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This extension renders PPAR-gamma2 more sensitive to insulin action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since there is a Pro12Ala substitution in this domain, we tested whether it is related to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, 131 type 2 diabetic patients and 312 normoglycemic control subjects were screened for the presence of the mutation and for major clinical and metabolic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the mutation did not differ significantly between diabetic patients and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BMI, insulin, and other metabolic and anthropometric variables were also not associated with the mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although the study was carried out on a sufficiently large sample, the conclusions do not support a major role for the Pro12Ala substitution of the PPAR-gamma gene in the etiology of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
