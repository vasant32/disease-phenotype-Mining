<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Increased <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> (OS) and impaired anti-OS defenses are important in the development and persistence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (IR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several anti-inflammatory and cell-protective mechanisms, including advanced glycation end product (AGE) receptor-1 (AGER1) and sirtuin (silent mating-type information regulation 2 homolog) 1 (SIRT1) are suppressed in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because basal OS in type 2 diabetic patients is influenced by the consumption of AGEs, we examined whether AGE consumption also affects IR and whether AGER1 and SIRT1 are involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study randomly assigned 36 subjects, 18 type 2 diabetic patients (age 61��4 years) and 18 healthy subjects (age 67±1.4 years), to a standard diet (&gt;20 AGE equivalents [Eq]/day) or an isocaloric AGE-restricted diet (&lt;10 AGE Eq/day) for 4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Circulating metabolic and inflammatory markers were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression and activities of AGER1 and SIRT1 were examined in patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMNC) and in AGE-stimulated, AGER1-transduced (AGER1+), or AGER1-silenced human monocyte-like <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Insulin and homeostasis model assessment, leptin, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-α and nuclear factor-κB p65 acetylation, serum AGEs, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33023">8-isoprostanes</z:chebi> decreased in AGE-restricted type 2 diabetic patients, whereas PMNC AGER1 and SIRT1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, and protein levels normalized and adiponectin markedly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>AGEs suppressed AGER1, SIRT-1, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13389">NAD</z:chebi>+ levels in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These effects were inhibited in AGER1+ but were enhanced in AGER1-silenced cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Food-derived pro-oxidant AGEs may contribute to IR in clinical type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and suppress protective mechanisms, AGER1 and SIRT1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>AGE restriction may preserve native defenses and insulin sensitivity by maintaining lower basal OS </plain></SENT>
