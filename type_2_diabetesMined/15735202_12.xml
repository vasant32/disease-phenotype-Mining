<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Amadori-modified proteins are the intermediate products of nonenzymatic glycation and constitute the forms of glycated proteins in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of the current study was to utilize two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, Western blot, and mass spectrometry to identify Amadori-modified plasma proteins in type 2 diabetic patients with poor glycemic control and assess the impact of short-term insulin treatment on the glycation of these proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We compared eight type 2 diabetic subjects (aged 56 +/- 3 years and BMI 29.7 +/- 0.9 kg/m(2)) with an average <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration of 8.5 years (range 3-19) with equal numbers of weight-matched (aged 56 +/- 2 years and BMI 30.1 +/- 10.0 kg/m(2)) and lean (aged 58 +/- 2 years and BMI 25 +/- 00.5 kg/m(2)) nondiabetic subjects who have no first-degree relatives with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two separate blood samples were collected from the type 2 diabetic subjects, one following 2 weeks of withdrawal of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> medications (T(2)D-; plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> 12.6 +/- 1.0 mmol/l) and another following 10 days of intensive insulin treatment (T(2)D+; plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> 5.5 +/- 0.2 mmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma proteins were separated using single and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis was performed, and several proteins, which reacted with the Amadori-antibody (1-deoxyfructosyl lysine), were identified by tandem mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No significant differences in the glycation of proteins between the <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and lean groups were noted, but type 2 diabetic patients had several proteins with higher glycation than the control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We identified 12 plasma proteins with reduced reaction to the anti-Amadori antibody upon intensive insulin treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A significant (P &lt; 0.03) difference in Amadori modification was observed between the T(2)D- and control subjects for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these proteins except the Ig light chain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Insulin treatment reduced Amadori modification of albumin (23.2%, P &lt; 0.02), fibrin (34.6%, P &lt; 0.001), Ig heavy chain constant region (20.7%, P &lt; 0.05), transferrin (25.4%, P &lt; 0.04), and Ig light chain (13%, P &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, Western blot analysis of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis identified alpha-fibrinogen precursor, beta-fibrinogen precursor, fibrinogen gamma-B chain precursor, hemopexin, <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> binding protein, and serine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37670">protease inhibitor</z:chebi> as proteins with a reduced reaction to anti-Amadori antibody upon intensive insulin treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The current approach offers the opportunity to identify Amadori modification of many proteins that may cause functional alterations and offers the potential for monitoring short-term glycemic control in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
