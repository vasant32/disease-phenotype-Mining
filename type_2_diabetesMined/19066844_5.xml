<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are associated with increased intracellular p38 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling, which may promote tissue <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Activation of p38 MAPK can be induced by either of the immediate upstream kinases, MAP kinase kinase (MKK)3 or MKK6, and recent evidence suggests that MKK3 has non-redundant roles in the pathology attributed to p38 MAPK activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this study examined whether MKK3 signalling influences the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>Wild-type</z:mp> and Mkk3 (also known as Map2k3) gene-deficient db/db mice were assessed for the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and renal injury from 8 to 32 weeks of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mkk3 (+/+) db/db and Mkk3 (-/-) db/db mice developed comparable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and were similar in terms of incidence and severity of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 32 weeks, diabetic Mkk3 (+/+) db/db mice had increased kidney levels of phospho-p38 and MKK3 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In comparison, kidney levels of phospho-p38 in diabetic Mkk3 ( -/- ) db/db mice remained <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, despite a fourfold compensatory increase in MKK6 protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The reduced levels of p38 MAPK signalling in the diabetic kidneys of Mkk3 ( -/- ) db/db mice was associated with protection against the following: declining renal function, increasing <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp>, renal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>, podocyte loss, mesangial cell activation and glomerular <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Diabetic Mkk3 ( -/- ) db/db mice were also significantly protected from tubular injury and interstitial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, which was associated with reduced Ccl2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression and interstitial macrophage accumulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: MKK3-p38 MAPK signalling is not required for the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but plays a distinct pathogenic role in the progression of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in db/db mice </plain></SENT>
