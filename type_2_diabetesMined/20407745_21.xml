<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are highly conserved pattern recognition receptors that coordinate the innate <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> to numerous substances, including NEFAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we investigated a potential contribution of TLR2 to the metabolic dysregulation induced by high-fat diet (HFD) feeding in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male and female littermate Tlr2(+/+) and Tlr2(-/-) mice were analysed with respect to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion and energy metabolism on chow and HFD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adipose, liver, muscle and islet pathology and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> were examined using molecular approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Macrophages and dendritic immune cells, in addition to pancreatic islets were investigated in vitro with respect to NEFA-induced cytokine production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: While not showing any differences in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis on chow diet, both male and female Tlr2(-/-) mice were protected from the adverse effects of HFD compared with Tlr2(+/+) littermate controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Female Tlr2(-/-) mice showed pronounced improvements in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and insulin secretion following 20 weeks of HFD feeding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These effects were associated with an increased capacity of Tlr2(-/-) mice to preferentially burn fat, combined with reduced tissue <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells and pancreatic islets from Tlr2(-/-) mice did not increase IL-1beta expression in response to a NEFA mixture, whereas Tlr2(+/+) control tissues did </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: These data suggest that TLR2 is a molecular link between increased dietary <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> intake and the regulation of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis, via regulation of energy substrate utilisation and tissue <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
