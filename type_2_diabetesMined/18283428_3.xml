<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a nationwide population-based follow-up study among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Danish patients hospitalised with first-time MI from 1996 to 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data on use of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering drugs and other medications, comorbidities, socioeconomic status, laboratory findings, readmission with MI and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were obtained from medical databases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We computed mortality rates and rates of MI and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> readmission, according to type of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering treatment and used Cox's proportional hazards regression analysis to compute hazard ratios (HRs) as estimates of relative risks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 8,494 MI patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall cumulative 30 day and 1 year mortality rates were 22.2 and 36.6%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients not receiving any <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering drugs (adjusted 30 day HR: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.57-1.10) and users of any combination (adjusted 30 day HR: 1.43, 95% CI: 0.98-2.09) had the lowest and highest mortality rates, respectively, when compared with users of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found that glycaemic control had no impact on the risk estimates in a subanalysis including biochemical laboratory data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found no differences in the risk of new MI and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> between the different <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Type of preadmission <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering treatment in monotherapy is not associated with substantial differences in prognosis following hospitalisation with MI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, patients treated with any combination had increased mortality rates </plain></SENT>
