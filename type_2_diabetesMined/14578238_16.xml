<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Outpatient Intensive Treatment (DOIT) program, a multiday group education and skills training experience combined with daily medical management, followed by case management over 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using a randomized control design, the study explored how DOIT affected glycemic control and self-care behaviors over a short term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The impact of two additional factors on clinical outcomes were also examined (frequency of case management contacts and whether or not insulin was started during the program) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients with type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in poor glycemic control (A1c &gt;8.5%) were randomly assigned to DOIT or a second condition, entitled EDUPOST, which was standard <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care with the addition of quarterly educational mailings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 167 patients (78 EDUPOST, 89 DOIT) completed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> baseline measures, including A1c and a questionnaire assessing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related self-care behaviors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 6 months, 117 patients (52 EDUPOST, 65 DOIT) returned to complete a follow-up A1c and the identical self-care questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At follow-up, DOIT evidenced a significantly greater drop in A1c than EDUPOST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DOIT patients also reported significantly more frequent blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring and greater attention to carbohydrate and fat contents (ACFC) of food compared with EDUPOST patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An increase in ACFC over the 6-month period was associated with improved glycemic control among DOIT patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Also, the frequency of nurse case manager follow-up contacts was positively linked to better A1c outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The addition of insulin did not appear to be a significant contributor to glycemic change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: DOIT appears to be effective in promoting better <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care and positively influencing glycemia and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related self-care behaviors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, it demands significant time, commitment, and careful coordination with many health care professionals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The role of the nurse case manager in providing ongoing follow-up contact seems important </plain></SENT>
