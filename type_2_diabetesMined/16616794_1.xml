<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of 18,470 diabetic patients registered with CoDiC in June, 2003, 12,279 patients were being treated with insulin preparations and/or oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi>, with 861 of these patients having Type 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and 11,418 patients having Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three analytical surveys were carried out with the Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Study I: Cross-sectional survey on the treatment in 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six hundred and thirteen patients received intensive conventional insulin treatment (ICT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of patients receiving rapid-acting insulin analogue (RA) was greater than that of patients receiving regular insulin (R) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum CPR was lower in the patients with ICT than in the patients with conventional insulin treatment (CT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Study II: Survey on the changes in the actual usage and clinical effectiveness of insulin preparations, based on the data input in 2001 and 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The number of patients with ICT using RA insulin markedly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Study III: Analysis of the participants' clinical course over the 18-month period of the study from the time of first consultation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The dose of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020459" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">insulin increased</z:e> during the term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The average HbA1c level fell drastically and reached to 7.5% over the first 9 months of the study and then remained between a range of 7.5% and 8% for the rest of the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, ICT is actively performed and the RA insulin analogues are widely used in Type 1 diabetic patients in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Basal-bolus therapy should be used to treat Type 1 diabetic patients with postprandial serum CPR of less than 0.5 ng/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It is difficult to obtain the ideal glycaemic control in Type 1 diabetic patients with the currently available insulin preparations </plain></SENT>
