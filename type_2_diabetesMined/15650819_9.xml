<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the relationship has not been clarified well in the Japanese </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, studies of the relationship between HbA(1)c and mortality from malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> are scarce </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: HbA(1)c was measured for 3,710 people of a cohort composed of A-bomb survivors and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At baseline they were divided into five groups: a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> HbA(1)c group of 1,143 individuals with HbA(1)c of &lt;5.5%, a slightly high but <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> HbA(1)c group of 1,341 individuals with HbA(1)c &gt; or =5.5% to &lt;6.0%, a slightly high HbA(1)c group of 589 individuals with HbA(1)c &gt; or =6.0% to &lt;6.5%, a high HbA(1)c group of 259 individuals with HbA(1)c &gt; or =6.5%, and a group of 378 individuals known to have type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using a Cox proportional hazards model, hazard ratios based on comparisons with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> HbA(1)c group were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the observation period there were 754 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> mortality, a significant increase of the hazard ratio was observed for the slightly high HbA(1)c group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A similar increase in malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo>-related mortality was observed for both the high HbA(1)c group and the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that individuals in the Japanese population with HbA(1)c levels of 6% or more might have increased mortality risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that HbA(1)c measurements should be sought even for people who have not been diagnosed with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
