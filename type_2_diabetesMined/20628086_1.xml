<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their use has been associated with peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>-outcomes that may have a genetic etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We genotyped 4,197 participants of the multiethnic DREAM (<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> REduction Assessment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8774">ramipril</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> Medication) trial with a 50k single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) array, which captures ∼2000 cardiovascular, inflammatory, and metabolic genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We tested 32,088 SNPs for an association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> among Europeans who received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> (n = 965) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One SNP, rs6123045, in NFATC2 was significantly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> (odds ratio 1.89 [95% CI 1.47-2.42]; P = 5.32 × 10(-7), corrected P = 0.017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Homozygous individuals had the highest <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> rate (hazard ratio 2.89, P = 4.22 × 10(-4)) when compared with individuals homozygous for the protective allele, with heterozygous individuals having an intermediate risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The interaction between the SNP and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> was significant (P = 7.68 × 10(-3)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six SNPs in NFATC2 were significant in both Europeans and Latin Americans (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Genetic variation at the NFATC2 locus contributes to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> among individuals who receive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
