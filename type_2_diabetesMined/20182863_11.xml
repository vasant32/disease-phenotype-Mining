<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Amyloid formation is considered a significant factor in deterioration of islet function and reduction in beta cell mass, and involves aggregation of monomers of the normally soluble beta cell <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, human islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (hIAPP) into oligomers, fibrils and, ultimately, mature amyloid deposits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite extensive in vitro studies, the process of hIAPP aggregation in vivo is poorly understood, though it is widely reported to promote cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, studies have suggested that only the early stages of fibril assembly, and in particular small hIAPP oligomers, are responsible for beta cell cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This challenges the prior concept that newly formed fibrils and/or mature fibrillar amyloid are cytotoxic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Herein, evidence both for and against the toxic hIAPP oligomer hypothesis is presented; from this, it is apparent that what exactly causes beta cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> when hIAPP aggregates remains debatable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, substantially more work with more specific reagents and techniques than are currently available will be required to identify conclusively the toxic species resulting from hIAPP aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Keeping an open mind on the nature of the cytotoxic insult has implications for therapeutic developments and clinical care in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
