<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We studied the association between baseline serum ferritin concentration and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in 360 clinically incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> cases and 758 controls nested within the EPIC (European Prospective Investigation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e>)-Norfolk Cohort Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum ferritin levels were categorised into five groups: sex-specific quartiles of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range of ferritin and a group with clinically raised ferritin below levels indicative of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018995" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">haemochromatosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Baseline serum ferritin was higher among cases than control participants (geometric mean: men 96.6 vs 67.8 ng/ml, respectively, p &lt; 0.001; women 45.9 vs 34.8 ng/ml, respectively, p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In analyses adjusted for known risk factors (age, BMI, sex, family history, physical activity, smoking habit) and dietary factors measured by 7-day food diary, the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was markedly elevated in participants with clinically raised ferritin compared with the lowest quartile (odds ratio [OR] 7.4, 95% CI 3.5-15.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further adjustment for potential confounding by <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> (C-reactive protein, IL-6 and fibrinogen) had no material impact on the observed association, while adjustment for hepatic enzymes (alanine aminotransferase and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24190">gamma glutamyl</z:chebi> transferase) and adiponectin attenuated the magnitude of association, but it remained statistically significant (OR 3.2 [1.3-7.6]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Serum ferritin is an important and independent predictor of the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This finding may have important implications for understanding the aetiology of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
