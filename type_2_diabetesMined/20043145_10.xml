<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether variants either confirmed or newly identified as <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility variants through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) modulate changes in phenotypes derived from an IVGTT in response to an endurance training programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analysed eight polymorphisms in seven type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> genes (CDKAL1 rs7756992; CDKN2A and CDKN2B rs10811661 and rs564398; HHEX rs7923837; IGF2BP2 rs4402960; KCNJ11 rs5215; PPARG rs1801282; and TCF7L2 rs7903146) in a maximum of 481 sedentary, non-diabetic white individuals, who participated in a 20-week endurance training programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Associations were tested between the variants and changes in IVGTT-derived phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The only evidence of association with training response was found with PPARG rs1801282 (Pro12Ala) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We observed that Ala carriers experienced greater increase in overall <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (Deltaglucose disappearance index Ala/Ala 0.22 +/- 0.22, Pro/Ala 0.14 +/- 0.06, Pro/Pro 0.004 +/- 0.03; p = 0.0008), <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> effectiveness (Ala/Ala 0.28 +/- 0.41, Pro/Ala 0.44 +/- 0.14, Pro/Pro 0.09 +/- 0.06; p = 0.004), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (Ala/Ala 64.21 +/- 37.73, Pro/Ala -11.92 +/- 40.30, Pro/Pro -46.30 +/- 14.70; p = 0.03) and disposition index (Ala/Ala 551.8 +/- 448.5, Pro/Ala 534.6 +/- 218.3, Pro/Pro -7.44 +/- 88.18; p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Compared with Pro/Pro individuals, PPARG Ala carriers experienced greater improvements in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin metabolism in response to regular endurance training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, we did not find evidence of association between type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility variants recently identified through GWAS and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis response to exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results extend those of previous studies showing that Ala carriers appear to be more responsive to beneficial health effects of lifestyle interventions </plain></SENT>
