<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The direct medical costs and cost-effectiveness of the interventions relative to the control group are reported here </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Relative effectiveness and costs of interventions (LSM, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, and LSM and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>) in the IDPP were estimated from the health care system perspective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Costs of intervention considered were only the direct medical costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Direct nonmedical, indirect, and research costs were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cost-effectiveness of interventions was measured as the amount spent to prevent one case of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> within the 3-year trial period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The direct medical cost to identify one subject with IGT was Indian rupees (INR) 5,278 ($117) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Direct medical costs of interventions over the 3-year trial period were INR 2,739 ($61) per subject in the control group, INR 10,136 ($225) with LSM, INR 9,881 ($220) with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, and INR 12,144 ($270) with LSM and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The number of individuals needed to treat to prevent a case of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 6.4 with LSM, 6.9 with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, and 6.5 with LSM and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cost-effectiveness to prevent one case of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with LSM was INR 47,341 ($1,052), with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> INR 49,280 ($1,095), and with LSM and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> INR 61,133 ($1,359) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Both LSM and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> were cost-effective interventions for preventing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among high risk-individuals in India and perhaps may be useful in other developing countries as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The long-term cost-effectiveness of the interventions needs to be assessed </plain></SENT>
