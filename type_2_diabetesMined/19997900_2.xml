<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We also compared the trends in patients with and without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used national registers to identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with clinically known type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Finland during the years 1988 to 2002 (n = 222,940) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> first-ever ACS events (n = 43,412) among these patients were identified using the Hospital Discharge Register and the Causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> Register </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">Cardiovascular Disease</z:e> Register we identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> first ACS attacks (n = 191,403) among non-diabetic patients in the country </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, we calculated annual age-standardised case fatality rates for ACS for three time periods: prehospital, days 0 to 27 and days 28 to 364 after the first ACS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The case fatality rate of first ACS declined significantly in both sexes at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time points considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The declining trends were not different between patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among men aged 35 to 74 years, 58.5% (95% CI 57.6-59.4%) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 44.1% (95% CI 43.8-44.5%) without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had died from cardiovascular causes 1 year after their first ACS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among women of the same age, the corresponding figures were 54.2% (95% CI 53.0-55.4%) and 36.5% (95% CI 35.9-37.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Men generally had higher case fatality rates than women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, except for prehospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, diabetic women had the same or even higher case fatality rates than non-diabetic men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The case fatality rates for first ACS show similar improving trends in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and in those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, case fatality rates have remained higher in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
