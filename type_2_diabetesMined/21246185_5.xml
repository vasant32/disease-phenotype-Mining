<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the long-term effects of such diets are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine whether high-protein diets are superior to high-carbohydrate diets for improving glycaemic control in individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Overweight/<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals (BMI 27-40 kg/m(2)) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (HbA(1c) 6.5-10%) were recruited for a 12 month, parallel design, dietary intervention trial conducted at a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> specialist clinic (Melbourne, VIC, Australia) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 108 initially randomised, 99 received advice to follow low-fat (30% total energy) diets that were either high in protein (30% total energy, n = 53) or high in carbohydrate (55% total energy, n = 46) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dietary assignment was done by a third party using computer-generated random numbers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was change in HbA(1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Secondary endpoints included changes in weight, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, blood pressure, renal function and calcium loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Study endpoints were assessed blinded to the diet group, but the statistical analysis was performed unblinded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study used an intention-to-treat model for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants who received dietary advice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Follow-up visits were encouraged regardless of dietary adherence and last measurements were carried forward for study non-completers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ninety-nine individuals were included in the analysis (53 in high protein group, 46 in high carbohydrate group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>HbA(1c) decreased in both groups over time, with no significant difference between groups (mean difference of the change at 12 months; 0.04 [95% CI -0.37, 0.46]; p = 0.44) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Both groups also demonstrated decreases over time in weight, serum triacylglycerol and total cholesterol, and increases in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>No differences in blood pressure, renal function or calcium loss were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These results suggest that there is no superior long-term metabolic benefit of a high-protein diet over a high-carbohydrate in the management of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
