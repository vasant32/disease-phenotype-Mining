<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aim of the present study is to compare the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi>, repaglinide, and insulin glargine in type 2 diabetics during Ramadan fasting on the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients, who were willing to fast, were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> (n=21), repaglinide (n=18), and insulin glargine (n=10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixteen non-fasting control type 2 diabetics matched for age, sex, and body mass index were also included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FBG), post-prandial blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (PBG), HbA1c, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24103">fructosamine</z:chebi> as well as <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism were evaluated in pre-Ramadan, post-Ramadan, and 1-month post-Ramadan time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no significant change from pre-Ramadan in FBG, PBG, and HbA1c variables in fasting diabetics at post-Ramadan and 1-month post-Ramadan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, PBG was found higher in non-fasting control diabetics at post-Ramadan and 1-month post-Ramadan (p&lt;0.05 and p&lt;0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24103">fructosamine</z:chebi> levels, a significant increase was noted both in fasting group and non-fasting group at 1-month post-Ramadan (p&lt;0.01 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, no significant difference was found in the comparison of the changes in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24103">fructosamine</z:chebi> levels between fasting group and non-fasting group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> did not significantly differ between fasting and non-fasting diabetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between three drug therapies regarding <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism and rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No adverse effects on plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> were noted in fasting diabetics </plain></SENT>
