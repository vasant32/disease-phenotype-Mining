<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A multiple choice online survey was completed by 847 physicians, of which 516 were engaged in primary care (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCP</z:e>) and 331 in specialized care (SCP) in the US, the UK, Germany and France (3-30 years in practice, at least 40 patients with T2D) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A continuous rating system was used to measure familiarity ("totally familiar" to "never heard of") or agreement with a statement (from "totally agree" to "totally disagree") </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The term "<z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>" was recognized by 74% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCPs</z:e> and 90% of SCPs (p&lt;0.05) and 76% felt that it was "a key but not the sole determinant of T2D" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only 47% agreed that "<z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta cell dysfunction</z:hpo> is a key determinant of T2D <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>" and 57% agreed with "<z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta cell dysfunction</z:hpo> being a key determinant of T2D progression" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Even among SCPs, 6% were not familiar with the term "<z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta cell dysfunction</z:hpo>" (16% among <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCPs</z:e>, p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall familiarity with the following terms was: 55% with "<z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta cell dysfunction</z:hpo>", 56% with "beta cells", 38% with "glucagon", 32% with "alpha cells", 55% with "hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> output", 15% with "incretins" and 18% with "GLP-1" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SCPs were significantly more familiar with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> terms than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCPs</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p-values &lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The pathogenetic role of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta cell dysfunction</z:hpo> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and progression of T2D did not seem to be well established. "<z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo>" was a well known concept even among <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCPs</z:e>, while "hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> output", "pancreatic alpha cells" and "glucagon" were not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Incretin hormones and GLP-1 were widely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This may effect prescribing behaviour and how well an individual's therapy is based on pathophysiology </plain></SENT>
