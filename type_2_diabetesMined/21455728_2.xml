<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and the role of AMPK in adipose tissue remain poorly characterised, we examined the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> on AMPK activity in adipose tissue of individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a randomised glycaemia-controlled crossover study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty men with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (aged 50-70 years) treated with diet, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> alone were recruited from North Glasgow University National Health Service Trusts' <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> clinics and randomised to either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi> for 10 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Randomisation codes, generated by computer, were put into sealed envelopes and stored by the hospital pharmacist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Medication bottles were numbered, and allocation was done in sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The participants and investigators were blinded to group assignment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the end of each phase of therapy adipose biopsy, AMPK activity (primary endpoint) and levels of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism and signalling proteins were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In parallel, the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> on AMPK and insulin-signalling pathways was investigated in 3T3-L1 adipocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ten participants were initially randomised to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and subsequently crossed over to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi>, while ten participants were initially randomised to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi> and subsequently crossed over to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No participants discontinued the intervention and the adipose tissue AMPK activity was analysed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 20 participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no adverse events or side effects in the study group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Adipose AMPK activity was increased following <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi> therapy (0.057 ± 0.007 vs 0.030 ± 0.005 [mean �� <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>] nmol min(-1) [mg lysate](-1); p &lt; 0.005), independent of AMPK level, glycaemia or plasma adiponectin concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The increase was associated with reduced levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15351">acetyl-CoA</z:chebi> carboxylase (ACC) protein and increased ACC Ser80 phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> reduced levels of ACC protein and stimulated phosphorylation of AMPK Thr172 and hormone-sensitive lipase Ser565 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results provide the first evidence that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> activates AMPK and reduces ACC protein levels in human adipose tissue in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Future studies are required to assess the role of adipose AMPK activation in the pharmacological effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
