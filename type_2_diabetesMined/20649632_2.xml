<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we assessed whether an impairment of insulin-mediated microvascular perfusion occurs early in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hooded Wistar rats were fed either a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> diet (ND) or a high-fat diet (HFD) for 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anaesthetized animals were subjected to an isoglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp (3 or 10 mU/min/kg x 2 h), and measurements were made of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion rate (GIR), hindleg <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake, muscle <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake by 2-deoxy-d-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (R'g), <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> appearance (Ra), <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disappearance (Rd), femoral blood flow (FBF) and hindleg 1-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="25348">methylxanthine</z:chebi> disappearance (1-MXD, an index of microvascular perfusion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with ND-fed animal, HFD feeding led to a mild increase in fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and plasma insulin, without an increase in total body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the clamps, HFD rats showed an impairment of insulin-mediated action on GIR, hindleg <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake, R'g, Ra, Rd and FBF, with a greater loss of insulin responsiveness at 3 mU/min/kg than at 10 mU/min/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The HFD also impaired insulin-mediated microvascular perfusion as assessed by 1-MXD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, 1-MXD was the only measurement that remained unresponsive to the higher dose of 10 mU/min/kg insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the early stage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> is characterized by an impairment of the insulin-mediated microvascular responses in skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This is likely to cause greater whole body <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> by limiting the delivery of hormones and nutrients to muscle </plain></SENT>
