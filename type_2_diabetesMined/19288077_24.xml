<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We undertook genotyping of 81 healthy young Danish men for rs7903146 of TCF7L2 and carried out various beta cell tests including: 24 h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin and glucagon profiles; OGTT; mixed meal test; IVGTT; hyperglycaemic clamp with co-infusion of glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (GLP)-1 or <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent insulinotropic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (GIP); and a euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp combined with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tracer infusion to study hepatic and peripheral insulin action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Carriers of the T allele were characterised by reduced 24 h insulin concentrations (p &lt; 0.05) and <z:mp ids='MP_0003059'>reduced insulin secretion</z:mp> relative to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> during a mixed meal test (beta index: p &lt; 0.003), but not during an IVGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This was further supported by reduced late-phase insulinotropic action of GLP-1 (p = 0.03) and GIP (p = 0.07) during a 7 mmol/l hyperglycaemic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Secretion of GLP-1 and GIP during the mixed meal test was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite elevated hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production, carriers of the T allele had significantly reduced 24 h glucagon concentrations (p &lt; 0.02) suggesting altered alpha cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Elevated hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production and reduced insulinotropic effect of incretin hormones contribute to an increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in carriers of the rs7903146 risk T allele of TCF7L2 </plain></SENT>
