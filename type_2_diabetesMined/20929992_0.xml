<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Altogether, 2,712 participants from three hospital districts in Finland attended a health examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cutoff scores ≥10 and ≥16 in the 21-item Beck <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Inventory (BDI-21) were used for depressive symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The participants were defined as having known <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> if they reported <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test was used to detect <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> regulation (NGR), impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (IFG), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT), and screen-detected <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The participants were defined as having IGR if they had IFG or IGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Prevalence of depressive symptoms, defined as a BDI-21 cutoff score ≥10, was 14.4% for those with NGR, 13.7% for those with IGR, 14.8% for those with screen-detected <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and 26.4% for those with previously known <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The corresponding prevalences for a cutoff score ≥16 were 3.4, 3.4, 4.2, and 7.5%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with NGR and adjusted for demographic, lifestyle, and biological factors, the odds ratios for IGR, screen-detected <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and previously known <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were 0.91 (95% CI 0.69-1.20), 0.70 (0.45-1.08), and 1.35 (0.84-2.15), respectively, for a cutoff score ≥10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For a cutoff score ≥16, the corresponding odds ratios were 1.05 (0.62-1.76), 0.87 (0.40-1.90), and 1.56 (0.69-3.50), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Participants with diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had a higher prevalence of depressive symptoms than participants with NGR, IGR, and previously unknown <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>When potential confounding factors were included in the analysis, previously known <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was not significantly associated with depressive symptoms </plain></SENT>
