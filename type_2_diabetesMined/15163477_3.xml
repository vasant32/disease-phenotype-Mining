<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Fingerstick capillary whole blood was collected from 400 children aged 11 to 13 years and the percent A1C was determined on-site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the boys, the A1C was significantly higher among the minorities (4.88+/-0.37%, mean+/-S.D.) than among the non-hispanic whites (4.73+/-0.41%, P&lt;0.01), but was similar in the two groups of girls (4.74+/-0.41 and 4.75+/-0.34, respectively, P=0.88) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>None of the students had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001952'>abnormal glucose tolerance</z:hpo> by the standards published for adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A1C in boys was higher among minorities than among the non-hispanic whites, even at this young age of 11-13 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This may be an early sign of predisposition to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among the groups known to be at higher risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, this difference was not seen among girls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reasons for the discrepancy between boys and girls is unexplained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A school-based fingerstick screening program proved to be practical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-related diseases, such as type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, increases among youth, the classroom may become an important location for screening </plain></SENT>
