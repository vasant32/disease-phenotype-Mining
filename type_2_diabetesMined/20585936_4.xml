<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we investigated the effect of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi> in a model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, Psammomys obesus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: P. obesus (morning blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> [mBG] 16.9 +/- 0.6 mmol/l) were treated with vehicle or different doses (1-15 mg/kg) of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6375">lansoprazole</z:chebi> for 17 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6375">lansoprazole</z:chebi> resulted in up to ninefold dose-dependent increases in endogenous gastrin levels (p &lt; 0.05 for 10 mg/kg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6375">lansoprazole</z:chebi> vs vehicle) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a significant reduction in mBG levels in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals in the high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6375">lansoprazole</z:chebi> groups during the 17 day treatment period, whereas there was no significant improvement in mBG in animals in the vehicle groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mBG at end of study was 18.2 +/- 2.1, 8.7 +/- 2.2 (p &lt; 0.01), and 6.1 +/- 2.3 (p &lt; 0.001) mmol/l for vehicle and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6375">lansoprazole</z:chebi> 10 and 15 mg/kg, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The animals treated with 15 mg/kg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6375">lansoprazole</z:chebi>, compared with vehicle, had a 2.3-fold increase in the intensity of insulin staining in beta cells (p=0.0002) and 50% higher beta cell mass (p=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATIONS: The <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6375">lansoprazole</z:chebi> had significant <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering effects in an animal model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, an effect that is most likely mediated through an increase in endogenous gastrin levels </plain></SENT>
