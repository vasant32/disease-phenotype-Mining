<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0002079'>hyperinsulinism</z:mp> induced by the use of long-acting insulin may be the key to explain this adverse effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate whether a regimen free of long-acting insulin can provide long-term glycaemic control without causing <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is an uncontrolled, 1-year study comprising 58 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and secondary failure, age 30-75 years, BMI 25-35 kg/m(2), HbA1c &gt; 7.5% and fasting C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> level &gt; 0.3 mmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were treated with the GAME regimen, a combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> administered at 20:00 hours for nocturnal glycaemic control, insulin aspart three times daily for meal-related <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-one per cent of the patients were considered evaluable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HbA1c decreased from 10.0 +/- 0.3 to 7.4 +/- 0.1% (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifty-nine per cent reached HbA1c levels &lt;or= 7.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic nocturnal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> was not reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Body weight tended to decrease during the first 3 months (-1.0 +/- 0.5 kg, p = 0.06), but then gradually rose to a value 0.8 +/- 0.5 kg higher than at baseline (p = 0.12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This is 4.4 +/- 0.6 kg less than predicted for conventional regimens employing long-acting insulin (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The GAME regimen provides long-term glycaemic control as well as stabilization of body weight in about 60% of type 2 patients presenting with secondary failure </plain></SENT>
