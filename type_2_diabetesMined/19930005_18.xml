<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients [body mass index (BMI) &gt;27 kg/m(2)] with elevated cardiovascular risk and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> inadequately controlled on two or three oral antidiabetes drugs (OADs) were randomized to add-on exenatide 5-10 microg b.i.d </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study population had baseline mean (s.d.) age of 56.5 (9.1) years and BMI of 34.1 (5.3) kg/m(2), and 58.5% of patients were taking two OADs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean baseline HbA1c was 8.65 (0.68)% in the exenatide group and 8.48 (0.66)% in the insulin glargine group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proportions of patients achieving the composite endpoint of HbA1c &lt; or =7.4% with <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> &lt; or =1 kg were 53.4% for the exenatide group and 19.8% for the insulin glargine group (p &lt; 0.001 for exenatide vs. insulin glargine) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Exenatide and insulin glargine did not demonstrate a significant difference in HbA1c improvements [least square (LS) mean [s.e.m.]: -1.25 [0.09]% and -1.26 [0.09]% respectively; p = 0.924], but had divergent effects on body weight (-2.73 [0.31] vs. +2.98 [0.31] kg respectively, p &lt; 0.001) after 26 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were more treatment-related adverse events with exenatide but a lower incidence of nocturnal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e>, with no differences in overall or severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Additional treatment with exenatide resulted in significantly more overweight and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with an elevated cardiovascular risk and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> achieving better glycaemic control with minimal <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> compared with insulin glargine </plain></SENT>
