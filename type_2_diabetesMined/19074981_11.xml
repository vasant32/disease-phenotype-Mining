<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The RETN gene encodes the adipokine resistin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Associations of RETN with plasma resistin levels, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and related metabolic traits have been inconsistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using comprehensive linkage disequilibrium mapping, we genotyped tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in RETN and tested associations with plasma resistin levels, risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and glycemic traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We examined 2,531 Framingham Offspring Study participants for resistin levels, glycemic phenotypes, and incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> over 28 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We genotyped 21 tag SNPs that capture common (minor allele frequency &gt;0.05) or previously reported SNPs at r2 &gt; 0.8 across RETN and its flanking regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used sex- and age-adjusted linear mixed-effects models (with/without BMI adjustment) to test additive associations of SNPs with traits, adjusted Cox proportional hazards models accounting for relatedness for incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and generated empirical P values (Pe) to control for type 1 error </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four tag SNPs (rs1477341, rs4804765, rs1423096, and rs10401670) on the 3' side of RETN were strongly associated with resistin levels (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> minor alleles associated with higher levels, Pe&lt;0.05 after multiple testing correction) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>rs10401670 was also associated with fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (Pe = 0.02, BMI adjusted) and mean <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> over follow-up (Pe = 0.01; BMI adjusted) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant association was observed for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On meta-analysis, the previously reported association of SNP -420C/G (rs1862513) with resistin levels remained significant (P = 0.0009) but with high <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> across studies (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SNPs in the 3' region of RETN are associated with resistin levels, and one of them is also associated with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, although replication is needed </plain></SENT>
