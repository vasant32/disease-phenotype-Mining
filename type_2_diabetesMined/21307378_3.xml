<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we evaluated how high-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> HbA(1c) levels predict type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We measured HbA(1c) in 919 Caucasian subjects, aged 40-79 years, and recorded new cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the following 15 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> was diagnosed with HbA(1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Subjects were stratified according to baseline HbA(1c) (&lt;5.0, 5.00-5.49 [reference], 5.50-5.99, and 6.00-6.49%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sex- and age-adjusted hazard ratios (95% CI) for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were 1.11 (0.30-4.41), 1.00, 3.79 (1.79-8.06), and 12.50 (5.51-28.34), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results did not change after adjusting for several putative confounding factors and were confirmed when models with updated variables were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: HbA(1c) is an independent risk factor for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subjects with high-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels of HbA(1c) deserve particular attention because they have a strong risk of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
