<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By blocking DPP-4, saxagliptin increases and prolongs the effects of incretins, a group of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25905">peptide hormones</z:chebi> released by intestinal cells after meals, which stimulate <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent insulin secretion to lower blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In controlled clinical trials, saxagliptin administered as monotherapy or in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi>, or a thiazolidinedione improved glycemic control in a clinically significant manner, reflected by significant decreases in glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (monotherapy, -0.5%; add-on to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, thiazolidinedione, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi>, -0.6% to 0.9%; initial combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, -2.5%), fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, saxagliptin improved β-cell function, reflected as increases in homeostasis model assessment (HOMA)-2β </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Saxagliptin was generally well tolerated; it did not increase <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> compared with controls, and was weight neutral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A meta-analysis of Phase II and III trials showed that saxagliptin did not increase the risk of major cardiovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Professional organizations have updated their guidelines for T2D to include a DPP-4 inhibitor as an early treatment option-either as initial therapy in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, or as add-on therapy for patients whose glycemia is inadequately controlled by a single oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drug </plain></SENT>
