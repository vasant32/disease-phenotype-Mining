<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: It is well established that the risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is closely linked to the presence and duration of overweight and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A reduction in the incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with lifestyle changes has previously been demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that adding a weight-reducing agent to lifestyle changes may lead to an even greater decrease in body weight, and thus the incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a 4-year, double-blind, prospective study, we randomized 3,305 patients to lifestyle changes plus either orlistat 120 mg or placebo, three times daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Participants had a BMI &gt;/=30 kg/m2 and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (79%) or impaired (21%) <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (IGT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Primary endpoints were time to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and change in body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analyses were by intention to treat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of orlistat-treated patients, 52% completed treatment compared with 34% of placebo recipients (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After 4 years' treatment, the cumulative incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 9.0% with placebo and 6.2% with orlistat, corresponding to a risk reduction of 37.3% (P = 0.0032) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Exploratory analyses indicated that the preventive effect was explained by the difference in subjects with IGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> after 4 years was significantly greater with orlistat (5.8 vs. 3.0 kg with placebo; P &lt; 0.001) and similar between orlistat recipients with impaired (5.7 kg) or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (NGT) (5.8 kg) at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A second analysis in which the baseline weights of subjects who dropped out of the study was carried forward also demonstrated greater <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> in the orlistat group (3.6 vs. 1.4 kg; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Compared with lifestyle changes alone, orlistat plus lifestyle changes resulted in a greater reduction in the incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> over 4 years and produced greater <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> in a clinically representative <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Difference in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence was detectable only in the IGT subgroup; <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> was similar in subjects with IGT or NGT [correction] </plain></SENT>
