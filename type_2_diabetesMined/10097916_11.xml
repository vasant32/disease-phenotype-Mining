<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 193 newly diagnosed, previously untreated, Caucasian type 2 diabetic subjects (135 men, 58 women) had FPG measured on two consecutive days (FPG1, FPG2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ethical approval and subjects' full informed consent were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects fasted for 12 h before each study day and rested for at least 30 min before blood was taken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was analyzed by a <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> oxidase method with intra- and interassay coefficients of variation (CVs) &lt; 2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Variability of FPG was assessed by comparison of percentage differences (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDs</z:e>): <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> = 100 (FPG2 - FPG1)/FPG1, with averaged FPG (FPGaver = [FPG1 + FPG2]/2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Biological and analytical variability were determined by use of SD2total = SD2biological + SD2analytical, where SD2analytical approximately equal to 2 x (CVglucose measurement)2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Given normally distributed data with zero mean, 95% of daily percentage differences will be expected to fall within a range of +/- 2 SDtotal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Subjects were age 54 +/- 10 years (mean +/- SD) and had BMI of 29.3 +/- 5.3 kg/m2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>FPG values for both days were 12.2 +/- 3.4 mmol/l (FPG1) and 12.1 +/- 3.3 mmol/l (FPG2), with a mean paired difference (95% CI) of 0.1 (0.0 to 0.3) mmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The variance of these differences increased with increasing FPGaver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDs</z:e> did not exhibit this effect and were normally distributed (mean -0.6% [-1.7 to 0.4]; SD 7.4% [6.8 to 8.3]), giving a 95% variability (2 SD) of 14.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Biological variability (2 SDbiological) was 13.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No significant difference in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> was found between men and women (mean difference 1.3% [-1.0 to 3.6]; SDmale 7.4%, SDfemale 7.3%; P = 0.62) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A total of 95% of the FPG values for this group of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic subjects varied within approximately +/- 15% on a daily basis, with approximately 14% caused by biological variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>As these results are expressed in percentage terms, subjects in the group with higher FPG values are likely to experience larger changes in FPG values measured from day to day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This variability should be considered when using FPG for the diagnosis and/or monitoring of response to treatment in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
