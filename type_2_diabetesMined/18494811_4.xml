<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-eight patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were randomized to receive either twice-daily 50/50 premixed insulin lispro (Mix50 group) or BB (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin at bedtime and preprandial insulin lispro) therapy (BB group) for 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA1C), 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG), blood plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level, body mass index (BMI), daily total insulin dosage and insulin therapy-related QOL (ITR-QOL) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ITR-QOL was significantly better in the Mix50 than in the BB group (103.1 +/- 9.8 vs. 90.6 +/- 19.4; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HbA(1c) improved in both groups (from 11.1 +/- 2.1 to 6.9 +/- 1.0% with Mix50 vs. from 11.0 +/- 2.3 to 6.6 +/- 0.8% with BB therapy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results might suggest that twice-daily injections of premixed rapid-acting insulin analogue therapy could achieve good glycaemic control and better QOL compared with BB therapy in insulin-naïve type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
