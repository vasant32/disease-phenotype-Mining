<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Whereas it is known that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> (MetS) has a paradoxically lower prevalence in non-Hispanic black adolescents than in non-Hispanic whites or Hispanics, the relative severity of MetS by race/ethnicity is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>Inflammation</z:mp>, indicated by high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), is a key factor linking MetS to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our goal was to determine whether elevations of hsCRP vary by race/ethnicity among adolescents with MetS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1999-2008) and evaluated adolescents (age 12-19 years) using a pediatric/adolescent adaptation of the ATP III definition of MetS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used linear regression to evaluate the interaction between MetS status and ethnicity with respect to hsCRP concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For male and female adolescents, MetS was associated with elevated hsCRP levels compared with adolescents without MetS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the elevation in hsCRP between adolescents with and without MetS was greater in non-Hispanic blacks compared with that in non-Hispanic whites (P = 0.04) but not that in Hispanics (P = 0.18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>hsCRP concentrations correlated with individual MetS components similarly among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ethnicities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In an evaluation of adolescents diagnosed with MetS, non-Hispanic blacks had higher BMI and more <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> than other ethnicities but there were no other racial/ethnic differences in the features of MetS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Non-Hispanic black adolescents have a greater differential in hsCRP between those with and those without MetS than the differential in non-Hispanic whites but not that in Hispanics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, even though MetS has a low prevalence in non-Hispanic blacks, MetS is a particularly good indicator of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in non-Hispanic black adolescents </plain></SENT>
