<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Thirty patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> underwent 12 weeks of PRT of six muscle groups (two sets, 10 repetitions each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The subjects were evaluated with detailed anthropometry and with measurements of the disappearance of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> per unit time (K) during the short insulin tolerance test (K(ITT)) for assessment of insulin sensitivity; of fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, A1C, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP); of total body fat, regional fat, and lean body mass by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry; and of cross-sectional skeletal muscle area of upper arm and thigh by computed tomography scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Insulin sensitivity improved significantly from mean +/- SD K(ITT) 1.22 +/- 0.73 to 2.13 +/- 0.75 (P &lt; 0.0001) after the intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant decline (mean difference +/- SD) from baseline was recorded in levels of the following parameters: A1C (0.54 +/- 0.4%, P &lt; 0.001), fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (2.7 +/- 2.2 mmol/l, P &lt; 0.001), total cholesterol (0.39 +/- 0.7 mmol/l, P = 0.003), serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (0.39 +/- 0.5 mmol/l, P &lt; 0.001), and truncal and peripheral subcutaneous adipose tissue compartments (SCAT) (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, no significant changes were noticed in BMI or levels of total body fat, truncal fat, lean body mass, cross-sectional skeletal muscle area of the extremities, or hsCRP levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Moderate-intensity PRT for 3 months resulted in significant improvement in insulin sensitivity, glycemia, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, and truncal and peripheral SCAT in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Resistance training should be an integral part of exercise regimen in Asian Indians with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
