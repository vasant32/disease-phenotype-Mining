<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to explore the associations between caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee consumption and measures of insulin sensitivity and secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study population included 954 multi-ethnic non-diabetic adults from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin Resistance</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Study (IRAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multiple regression analyses were performed to examine the cross-sectional relationships between caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee intake and insulin sensitivity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin response, measured by a frequently sampled intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test, 2 h postload <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> measured by OGTT, fasting insulin, and proinsulin to C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Caffeinated coffee intake was positively associated with insulin sensitivity (β = 0.054; SE = 0.026; p = 0.04) and inversely related to 2 h postload <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (β = -0.37; SE = 0.10; p = 0.0003) in fully adjusted models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Caffeinated coffee intake was not associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin response or proinsulin ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Decaffeinated coffee intake was inversely related to 2 h postload <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (β = -0.47; SE = 0.18; p = 0.0096) and positively related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin response (β = 0.191; SE = 0.077; p = 0.0132) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Decaffeinated coffee intake was inversely related to the ratios of both intact and split proinsulin to C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (β = -0.150; SE = 0.061; p = 0.0148; β = -0.254; SE = 0.068; p = 0.0002, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In this cross-sectional study, caffeinated coffee was positively related to insulin sensitivity and decaffeinated coffee was favourably related to measures of beta cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results provide pathophysiological insight as to how coffee could impact the risk of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
