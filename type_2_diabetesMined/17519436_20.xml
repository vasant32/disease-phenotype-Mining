<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A literature search was conducted in MEDLINE and the Commonwealth Agricultural Bureau </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eligible studies were English language randomized controlled trials of <z:chebi fb="74" ids="28073">chromium</z:chebi> supplement intake &gt; or = 3 weeks, with &gt; or = 10 participants receiving <z:chebi fb="74" ids="28073">chromium</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> trials with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism outcomes and trials of individuals with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> for <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> outcomes were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Meta-analyses were performed as appropriate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-one studies met criteria, almost half of which were of poor quality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among participants with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:chebi fb="74" ids="28073">chromium</z:chebi> supplementation improved glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels by -0.6% (95% CI -0.9 to -0.2) and fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> by -1.0 mmol/l (-1.4 to -0.5) but not <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no benefit in individuals without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were some indications of dose effect and differences among <z:chebi fb="74" ids="28073">chromium</z:chebi> formulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Larger effects were more commonly observed in poor-quality studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The evidence was limited by poor study quality, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in methodology and results, and a lack of consensus on assessment of <z:chebi fb="74" ids="28073">chromium</z:chebi> status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: No significant effect of <z:chebi fb="74" ids="28073">chromium</z:chebi> on <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism was found in people without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="74" ids="28073">Chromium</z:chebi> supplementation significantly improved glycemia among patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, future studies that address the limitations in the current evidence are needed before definitive claims can be made about the effect of <z:chebi fb="74" ids="28073">chromium</z:chebi> supplementation </plain></SENT>
