<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare the incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> between low-income Mexican-Americans residing in San Antonio, Texas, and low-income residents in Mexico City, Mexico </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using data from the San Antonio Heart Study and the Mexico City <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study, we compared the incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in 35- to 64-year-old low-income Mexican-American residents of San Antonio with similarly aged low-income residents of Mexico City </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because of the different follow-up times in the two studies, Poisson regression was used to compare the rates of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Potential risk factors for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were also analyzed to determine whether they explained or contributed to a difference in incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The age- and sex-adjusted incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was significantly higher in San Antonio (RR 2.01) compared with Mexico City </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This difference was seen primarily in the oldest age group (55-64 years of age) and remained statistically significant after adjusting for a number of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk factors, including demographic, anthropometric, and metabolic variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Follow-up rates were similar in both cities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that there was a higher incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in San Antonio than in Mexico City, and that difference occurred primarily in individuals in the oldest age group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The potential mediating factors we examined did not account for this difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Other factors, such as exercise and diet, which were not available for analysis in this study, in addition to a cohort effect, may have contributed to the difference in incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the two cities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, there was no evidence of a higher case fatality among diabetic individuals from Mexico City compared with San Antonio </plain></SENT>
