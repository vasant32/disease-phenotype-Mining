<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The short-chain l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCHAD) protein is involved in the penultimate step of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> fatty acid oxidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previously, it has been shown that mutations in the corresponding gene (HADHSC) are associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002079'>hyperinsulinism</z:mp> in infancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The presumed function of the SCHAD enzyme in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion led us to the hypothesis that common variants in HADHSC on chromosome 4q22-26 might be associated with development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have performed a large-scale association study in four different cohorts from the Netherlands and Denmark (n = 7,365) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Direct sequencing of HADHSC cDNA and databank analysis identified four tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) including one missense variant (P86L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neither the SNPs nor haplotypes investigated were associated with the disease, enzyme function, or any relevant quantitative measure (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &gt; 0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The present study provides no evidence that the specific HADHSC variants or haplotypes examined do influence susceptibility to develop type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that it is unlikely that variation in HADHSC plays a major role in the pathogenesis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the examined cohorts </plain></SENT>
