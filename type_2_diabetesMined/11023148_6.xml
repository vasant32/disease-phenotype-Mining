<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the role of the hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1alpha and HNF-4alpha genes in the etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Finnish and Chinese subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The whole coding regions of the genes encoding for HNF-1alpha and HNF-4alpha, including approximately 800 bp of the HNF-1alpha promoter, were investigated in 40 Finnish subjects (fasting C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> 50-570 pmol/l) and 47 Chinese subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Frequencies of the variants of these genes were analyzed by restriction fragment-length polymorphism analysis in additional samples of 100 Finnish diabetic patients and 82 Finnish control subjects and in 58 Chinese diabetic patients and 51 Chinese control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No previously reported gene defects were detected, but one novel functionally silent GCC--&gt;GCG variant (nucleotide 73, exon 10) was observed in the HNF-4alpha gene in a Chinese diabetic patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the Ala98Val substitution of the HNF-1alpha gene occurred at a significantly higher frequency in 140 Finnish diabetic patients compared with 82 control subjects (P = 0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Ala98Val variant was not, however, associated with abnormalities in insulin secretion evaluated by oral and intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests in subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (n = 295) or impaired (n = 38) <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Variants in the HNF-1alpha and HNF-4alpha genes are unlikely to play a major role in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Finnish and Chinese subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the association of the Ala98Val variant of the HNF-1alpha gene with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Finnish subjects may indicate a diabetogenic locus close to the HNF-1alpha gene </plain></SENT>
