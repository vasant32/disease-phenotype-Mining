<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because little is known about the impact of outpatient <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> management on <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> outcomes, we examined changes in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profiles in urban African-Americans who attended a structured <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of initial and 1-year follow-up <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> values was conducted among patients selected from a computerized registry of an urban outpatient <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The independent effects of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-specific medications, glycemic control, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> on serum total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels were evaluated by analysis of covariance and multiple linear regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 345 patients (91% African-American and 95% with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>), HbA(1c) decreased from 9.3% at the initial visit to 8.2% at 1 year (P &lt; 0.001); total and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels were significantly lower, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> was higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After stratifying based on use of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-specific therapy, different outcomes were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 243 patients not taking <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> medications, average total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> concentrations at 1 year were similar to initial values, whereas in 102 patients receiving pharmacotherapy, these <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lower at 1 year relative to baseline (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> increased regardless of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> treatment status (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for other variables, changes in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> concentration were associated only with use of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-specific agents (P = 0.003), whereas improved HbA(1c) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> had no independent effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">Lipid</z:chebi> therapy, improved glycemic control, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> were not independently related to changes in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> and therefore could not account for the positive changes observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Use of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-directed medications, improvement in glycemic control, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> resulted in significant declines in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels but only improved HbA(1c) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> had an independent effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among urban African-Americans, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> management led to favorable changes in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels, but improved glycemic control and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> had no independent effect on <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Initiation of pharmacologic therapy to treat <z:mp ids='MP_0000182'>high LDL cholesterol levels</z:mp> should be considered early in the course of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> management to reach recommended targets and reduce the risk of cardiovascular complications in this patient population </plain></SENT>
