<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The ORP150 gene that encodes the human oxygen-regulated protein (150 kDa) maps to chromosome 11q23, a region previously reported to be linked to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in Pima Indians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This gene was also found to be differentially expressed in global gene expression studies comparing muscle <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> from insulin-resistant versus insulin-sensitive subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, ORP150 was analyzed as a candidate gene for susceptibility to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twelve variants were identified, and three unique representative polymorphisms were genotyped in 1,338 Pima Indians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None of these polymorphisms were associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but two polymorphisms were significantly associated with measures of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that ORP150 has a role in insulin action but does not have a major role in determining susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Pima Indians </plain></SENT>
