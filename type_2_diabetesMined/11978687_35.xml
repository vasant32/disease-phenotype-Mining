<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the role of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> in prospective analyses of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo> (PVD) in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, taking into account other potential risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Potential risk factors for the development of PVD were examined in 3,834 of 5,102 individuals enrolled in the U.K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prospective <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study (UKPDS) without PVD at diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, followed for 6 years, and for whom relevant data were available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PVD was defined as two of the following: ankle-arm blood pressure index &lt; 0.8, absence of both dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses to palpation in one or both legs, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004417'>intermittent claudication</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression was used to estimate the association between potential risk factors measured 3-4 months after diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and incident PVD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of PVD at 3-year intervals to 18 years was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>Hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, assessed as HbA(1c), was associated with an increased risk for incident PVD, independent of other risk factors including age, increased systolic blood pressure, reduced <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, smoking, prior <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000763'>peripheral sensory neuropathy</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Each 1% increase in HbA(1c) was associated with a 28% increased risk of PVD (95% CI 12-46), and each 10-mmHg increase in systolic blood pressure with a 25% increase in risk (95% CI 10-43) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>Hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, as well as smoking, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e>, and blood pressure are potentially modifiable risk factors for the development of PVD </plain></SENT>
