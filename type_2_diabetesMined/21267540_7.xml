<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent genome-wide association (GWA) studies have identified multiple loci robustly associated with BMI and risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, information on their associations with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Such information could help increase our understanding of the link between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We examined the associations of 12 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> susceptibility loci, individually and in combination, with risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the population-based European Prospective Investigation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> (EPIC) Norfolk cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We genotyped 12 SNPs, identified by GWA studies of BMI, in 20,428 individuals (aged 39-79 years at baseline) with an average follow-up of 12.9 years, during which 729 individuals developed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A genetic predisposition score was calculated by adding the BMI-increasing alleles across the 12 SNPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Associations with incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were examined by logistic regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 12 SNPs, eight showed a trend with increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, consistent with their BMI-increasing effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Each additional BMI-increasing allele in the genetic predisposition score was associated with a 4% increased odds of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (OR 1.041, 95% CI 1.005-1.078; p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Adjustment for BMI completely abolished the association with incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (OR 1.003, 95% CI 0.967-1.039; p = 0.89) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The genetic predisposition to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> leads to increased risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, which is completely mediated by its <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-predisposing effect </plain></SENT>
