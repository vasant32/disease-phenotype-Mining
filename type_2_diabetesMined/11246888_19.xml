<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of this complication is poorly understood, but it clearly involves production in the vascular wall of macrophage (Mo) <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> lipase (LPL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mo LPL is increased in human <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Peripheral factors dysregulated in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, including <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and free fatty acids (FAs), may contribute to this alteration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> stimulates LPL production in both J774 murine and human Mo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we evaluated the direct effect of FAs on murine Mo LPL expression and examined the involvement of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) in this effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>J774 Mo were cultured for 24 h with 0.2 mmol/l unsaturated FAs (arachidonic [AA], eicosapentaenoic [<z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi>], and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17351">linoleic acids</z:chebi> [LA]) and monounsaturated (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16196">oleic acid</z:chebi> [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e>]) and saturated FAs (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15756">palmitic acid</z:chebi> [PA] and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28842">stearic acid</z:chebi> [SA]) bound to 2% bovine serum albumin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the end of this incubation period, Mo LPL <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression, immunoreactive mass, activity, and synthetic rate were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Incubation of J774 cells with LA, PA, and SA significantly increased Mo LPL <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, exposure of these cells to AA and <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> dramatically decreased this parameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> FAs, with the exception of <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e>, increased extra- and intracellular LPL immunoreactive mass and activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Intracellular LPL mass and activity paralleled extracellular LPL mass and activity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> FA-treated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In Mo exposed to AA, LA, and PA, an increase in Mo LPL synthetic rate was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the role of PPARs in the modulatory effect of FAs on Mo LPL gene expression, DNA binding assays were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Results of these experiments demonstrate an enhanced binding of nuclear proteins extracted from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> FA-treated Mo to the peroxisome proliferator-response element (PPRE) consensus sequence of the LPL promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>PA-, SA-, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e>-stimulated binding activity was effectively diminished by immunoprecipitation of the nuclear proteins with anti-PPAR-alpha antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In contrast, anti-PPAR-gamma antibodies only significantly decreased AA-induced binding activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Overall, these results provide the first evidence for a direct regulatory effect of FAs on Mo LPL and suggest a potential role of PPARs in the regulation of Mo LPL gene expression by FAs </plain></SENT>
