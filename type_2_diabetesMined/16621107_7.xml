<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Asian Indians have shown an increasing prevalence of T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">Apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E (APOE) and Angiotensin-1 converting enzyme (ACE) I/D polymorphisms have been associated with T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study examined the association of APOE and ACE genes with T2DM patients of Punjab, India </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>APOE (HhaI) and ACE (I/D) genotypes analysed by polymerase chain reaction were available from 90 patients and 97 random healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> loci and populations are in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There is no significant association of APOE vis-Ã -vis T2DM, however APOE*4 allele frequency is low in diabetics (3.9% and 8.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DD genotype and *D allele of ACE are associated with T2DM (OR=1.90, p&lt;0.05, and OR=1.58, p&lt;0.05, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recessive and multiplicative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>mode of inheritance</z:hpo> for *D allele provided the strongest support for the association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Height, weight and BMI did not reveal any significant association with <z:chebi fb="16" ids="53704">APO</z:chebi> or ACE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DD-33 and ID-23 combinations (ACE-APOE) showed higher odds of 2.01 and 2.14, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>ACE but not APOE polymorphism is positively associated with T2DM in Indian population, however, the synergistic effects of DD-33 and ID-23 are also evident </plain></SENT>
