<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Eligible participants (n = 299) were randomized within strata of baseline common carotid artery (CCA) intima-media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) (&lt;0.8 mm, &gt;or=0.8 mm) to 400 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> daily or placebo for 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A general linear mixed-effects model was used to compare the rate of change in CCA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> between treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, average rates of CCA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> change were not significantly different between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi>- and placebo-treated subjects (0.0030 +/- 0.021 vs. 0.0066 +/- 0.021 mm/year; P = 0.17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the stratum of subjects with CCA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> &gt;or=0.8 mm, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> significantly reduced the progression of CCA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> relative to placebo (0.0013 +/- 0.022 vs. 0.0084 +/- 0.023 mm/year; P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, and HbA(1c) were significantly lower in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi>- versus placebo-treated subjects (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Whereas blood pressure significantly differed between treatment groups in the &gt;or=0.8-mm stratum, there was no difference between treatment groups in the &lt;0.8-mm stratum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Insulin sensitization and reduction in blood pressure may be contributory mechanisms by which <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> reduced subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> progression in this cohort of well-controlled insulin-dependent patients with clinical characteristics suggesting type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
