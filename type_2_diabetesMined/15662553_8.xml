<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it remains uncertain whether the association between non-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> and cardiovascular risk in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> depends on the status of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine whether non-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> predicts CHD events among diabetic women independently of currently established risk factors and the status of glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively followed 921 diabetic women in the Nurses' Health Study, who were free of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> at the time that blood was drawn in 1989/90 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During 10 years of follow-up, we identified 122 incident CHD cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After adjustment for age, BMI, smoking, alcohol consumption, and other lifestyle risk factors, the multivariate relative risks (RRs) of CHD for extreme quartiles were 1.97 (95% CI: 1.14-3.43) for non-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, 1.78 (1.02-3.11) for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B-100, and 1.93 (1.15-3.22) for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the association between non-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> and CHD risk was only apparent among women with elevated fasting <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (RR for extreme quartiles: 3.80; p=0.045) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HbA(1)c was strongly associated with increased CHD risk (RR for increase by 1 unit: 1.24; 95% CI: 1.13-1.35), and both non-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> and HbA(1)c additively predicted CHD risk (RR for the combination of high non-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> and high HbA(1)c [tertiles]: 4.59) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our study suggests that non-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> and HbA(1)c are potent predictors of CHD risk in diabetic women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therapies to lower CHD risk in diabetic patients should emphasise both glycaemic control and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> lowering </plain></SENT>
