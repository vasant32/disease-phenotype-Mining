<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A possible explanation is a genotype-dependent difference in the complex splicing pattern; however, this has not previously been characterised in pancreatic or insulin target tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, the detailed TCF7L2 splicing pattern in five human tissues is described and dependence on risk genotype explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: RT-PCR and quantitative real-time PCR were employed to characterise TCF7L2 splicing in pancreatic islets, blood lymphocytes, skeletal muscle and subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue from non-diabetic individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mapping of TCF7L2 splice variants shows a specific pattern in pancreatic islets, with four predominant transcripts and high usage of the variable exons 4 and 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall concentration of TCF7L2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> is highest in islets and fat and lower in blood and muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant difference in overall amount or splicing pattern was observed between carriers and non-carriers of the rs7903146 risk (T) allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, incorporation of exon 4 in islets correlates positively with plasma HbA(1c) levels (r = 0.758; p = 0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: There were pronounced tissue-specific differences in the splicing of TCF7L2 with forms containing exon 4 and 15 being most abundant in islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incorporation of exon 4 in islets correlated with HbA(1c) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further experiments will be needed to determine the direction of this correlation, and larger cohorts needed to unequivocally resolve whether there is a relationship between genotype and splicing in islets </plain></SENT>
