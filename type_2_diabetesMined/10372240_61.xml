<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To expand on this finding, we investigated at the clinical level how long-term administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> influences the body fat distribution in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">Troglitazone</z:chebi> (400 mg/day) was administered for 6 months to 30 type 2 diabetic patients whose glycemic control was poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 18 patients received diet therapy alone (in the single-treatment group, BMI 26.0 +/- 4.6, HbA1c 8.2 +/- 1.7%), and 12 patients concomitantly received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> (1.25-7.5 mg/day) (in the concomitant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> group, BMI 25.4 +/- 4.7, HbA1c 9.2 +/- 1.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BMI, HbA1c, serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> level, and body fat distribution, which were determined by computed tomography (CT) scan at the umbilical level, were measured and compared before and after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the 6-month <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> treatment, HbA1c levels decreased and BMI increased in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As for body fat distribution in the single-treatment group, visceral fat area (VFA) decreased (from 118.3 +/- 54.3 to 101.1 +/- 50.8 cm2; P &lt; 0.001), and subcutaneous fat area (SFA) increased (from 189.7 +/- 93.3 to 221.6 +/- 101.6 cm2; P &lt; 0.001), resulting in a decrease in visceral/subcutaneous (V/S) ratio (from 0.74 +/- 0.48 to 0.50 +/- 0.32; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the concomitant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> group, VFA was unchanged (from 108.1 +/- 53.5 to 112.5 +/- 59.9 cm2), while SFA increased (from 144.6 +/- 122.0 to 180.5 +/- 143.5 cm2; P &lt; 0.01), thereby decreasing the V/S ratio (from 0.91 +/- 0.46 to 0.77 +/- 0.44; P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> level and the area under <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> curve during the 75-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test decreased significantly in the single-treatment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: According to our data, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> appears to promote fat accumulation in the subcutaneous adipose tissue rather than in the visceral adipose tissue in mildly <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> Japanese people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This shift of energy accumulation from the visceral to subcutaneous adipose tissue may greatly contribute to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi>-mediated amelioration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
