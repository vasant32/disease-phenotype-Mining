<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our hIAPP transgenic mice developed islet amyloid when fed a breeder chow but not regular chow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because the breeder chow contained increased amounts of fat, we hypothesized that increased dietary fat enhances islet amyloid formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, we fed male hIAPP transgenic and nontransgenic control mice diets containing 15% (low fat), 30% (medium fat), or 45% (high fat) of calories derived from fat for 12 months, and we measured islet amyloid, islet <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> cell composition, and beta-cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Increased dietary fat in hIAPP transgenic mice was associated with a dose-dependent increase in both the prevalence (percentage of islets containing amyloid deposits; 34 +/- 8, 45 +/- 8, and 58 +/- 10%, P &lt; 0.05) and severity (percentage of islet area occupied by amyloid; 0.8 +/- 0.5, 1.0 +/- 0.5, and 4.6 +/- 2.5%, P = 0.05) of islet amyloid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, in these hIAPP transgenic mice, there was a dose-dependent decrease in the proportion of islet area comprising beta-cells, with no significant change in islet size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, nontransgenic mice adapted to diet-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> by increasing their islet size more than twofold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increased dietary fat was associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948379" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">impaired insulin secretion</z:e> in hIAPP transgenic (P = 0.05) but not nontransgenic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In summary, dietary fat enhances both the prevalence and severity of islet amyloid and leads to beta-cell loss and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948379" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">impaired insulin secretion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because both morphologic and functional defects are present in hIAPP transgenic mice, this would suggest that the effect of dietary fat to enhance islet amyloid formation might play a role in the pathogenesis of the islet lesion of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in humans </plain></SENT>
