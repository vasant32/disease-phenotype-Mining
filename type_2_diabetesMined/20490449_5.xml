<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ZNT8 is also an autoantigen associated with the appearance of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A number of experimental models have been employed to suggest how ZNT8 and other zinc transporters regulate beta cell insulin processing and possibly secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An additional role for the zinc transporters in regulating alpha cell function has been suggested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this issue of Diabetologia, Wijesekara and colleagues, using a cell-specific Znt8 (also known as Slc30a8) knockout model, demonstrate that beta cell insulin processing and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance is negatively affected after beta cell knock out of Znt8, whereas Znt8 knockout in alpha cells seems to have little effect on glucagon secretion or <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although we are yet to see the therapeutic potential of these new findings, the area represents a field through which manipulation of islet function may eventually be possible </plain></SENT>
