<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We determined the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> haplogroup and the mtDNA sequence of the control region in 859 subjects with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 1,151 normoglycemic control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Full-length mtDNA sequences were conducted in 40 subjects harboring specific <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related haplogroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression analysis with adjustment for age, sex, and BMI revealed that subjects harboring the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> haplogroup B4 have significant association with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (DM) (odds ratio [OR], 1.54 [95% CI 1.18-2.02]; P &lt; 0.001), whereas subjects harboring D4 have borderline resistance against DM generation (0.68 [0.49-0.94]; P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Upon further study, we identified an mtDNA composite group susceptible to DM generation consisting of a 10398A allele at the coding region and a polycytosine variant at nucleotide pair 16184-16193 of the control region, as well as a resistant group consisting of C5178A, A10398G, and T152C variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The OR for susceptible group is 1.31 (95% CI 1.04-1.67; P = 0.024) and for the resistant group is 0.48 (0.31-0.75; P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our study found that mtDNA variants in the coding and control regions can have combined effects influencing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> generation </plain></SENT>
