<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Aggregation of human amylin (hA) into beta-sheet-containing oligomers is linked to islet <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta-cell dysfunction</z:hpo> and the pathogenesis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigated possible contributions of Fas-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>-receptor signaling to the mechanism of hA-evoked beta-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We measured responses to hA in isolated mouse islets and two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021670" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">insulinoma</z:e> cell lines, wherein we measured Fas/Fas ligand (FasL) and Fas-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> domain (FADD) expression by quantitative RT-PCR, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used two anti-Fas/FasL blocking antibodies and the Fas/FasL <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> Kp7-6 to probe roles of Fas interactions in the regulation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in hA-treated beta-cells and measured Kp7-6-mediated effects on beta-sheet formation and aggregation using circular dichroism and thioflavin-T binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: hA treatment stimulated Fas and FADD expression in beta-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both blocking antibodies suppressed hA-evoked <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> but did not modify its aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, Fas receptor interactions played a critical role in induction of this pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, hA-evoked beta-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was suppressed and rescued by Kp7-6, which also impaired hA beta-sheet formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report linking hA-evoked induction and activation of Fas and FADD to beta-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We have identified a Fas/FasL <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, Kp7-6, as a potent inhibitor of hA aggregation and related beta-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results also support an interaction between hA and Fas on the surface of apoptotic beta-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Increased expression and activation of Fas in beta-cells could constitute a molecular event common to the pathogenesis of both type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, although the mode of pathway activation may differ between these common forms of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
