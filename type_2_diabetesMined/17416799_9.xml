<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Adiponectin has been associated with low <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The metabolic effects of adiponectin are mediated by adiponectin receptors 1 (ADIPOR1) and 2 (ADIPOR2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a prospective, nested case-control study of 714 cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 1,120 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six polymorphisms in ADIPOR1 and 16 polymorphisms in ADIPOR2 were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Haplotypes inferred from ADIPOR1 polymorphisms were significantly associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk (overall test, -2log-likelihood = 15.1 on 5 df; P = 0.0098) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A single copy of haplotype 001100 (0, common allele; and 1, minor allele) was associated with 24% decreased risk (odds ratio [OR] 0.76 [95% CI 0.61-0.96], P = 0.02) compared with the most common haplotype, 110000, adjusting for age, BMI, and other covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A 3' untranslated region (UTR) polymorphism, rs1139646, showed the strongest and nominally significant association with greater <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk (unadjusted OR 1.26 [1.03-1.53] and adjusted OR 1.36 [1.10-1.70]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, such an association became marginal after controlling for multiple comparisons by permutation test (P = 0.08 on the basis of 10,000 permutations) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were not significant associations between ADIPOR2 polymorphisms, individually or in haplotypes, and the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our data indicate significant associations between ADIPOR1 haplotypes and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk but do not support a relation between ADIPOR2 variability and the disease </plain></SENT>
