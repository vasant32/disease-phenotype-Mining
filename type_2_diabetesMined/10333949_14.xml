<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether humans with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have increased levels of oxidized fatty acids in their serum chylomicron fraction after the ingestion of dietary oxidized fatty acids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study was performed on 31 male type 2 diabetic patients and 24 age-matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among the diabetic patients, 22 had poor glycemic control, defined as HbA1 &gt; 10% (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> value &lt; 7.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nine patients had good glycemic control (HbA1 &lt; or = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Heated corn oil containing low or high levels of oxidized fatty acids was used as a test meal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 2.5 h after the test meal, 50-ml blood samples were obtained from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects, and the chylomicron fraction (Sf &gt; 1,000) was isolated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The degree of oxidation in chylomicrons was determined by measuring conjugated dienes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For determining the postprandial levels of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> and of oxidized <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> in serum chylomicrons over an extended time period, blood samples were obtained at 0, 2.5, 5.0, and 7.5 h for isolation of chylomicrons and determination of fatty acid oxidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that at 2.5 h after the consumption of the test meal containing either a low or high oxidized fatty acid content, conjugated dienes in serum chylomicrons in diabetic subjects in poor glycemic control were increased compared with those in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Diabetic patients in good glycemic control had similar levels of oxidized <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> in their chylomicrons when compared with control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Additionally, in diabetic patients in poor glycemic control, the levels of oxidized <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> in chylomicrons remained elevated for an extended post-prandial period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In diabetic subjects with poor glycemic control, dietary oxidized <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> induce an exaggerated and sustained increase in the levels of oxidized <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> in chylomicrons when compared with either control subjects or diabetic patients with good glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These increased postprandial levels of potentially atherogenic oxidized <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> may contribute to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0004943'>accelerated atherosclerosis</z:hpo> associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
