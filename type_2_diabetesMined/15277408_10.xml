<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: 1,5-Anhydroglucitol (1,5AG) is a major circulating <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26191">polyol</z:chebi> arising primarily from ingestion and excreted competitively with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Japanese studies have demonstrated reduced concentrations of 1,5AG in serum in hyperglycemic patients in comparison with euglycemic subjects and a gradual normalization of 1,5AG values for patients responding to antihyperglycemic therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this first U.S. study, we assessed the ability of 1,5AG measurements to monitor glycemic control in a cohort of 77 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (22 with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 55 with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) who presented with suboptimal glycemic control at baseline (defined as HbA(1c) &gt;or=7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Each patient received therapies consisting of combinations of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> education, nutritional counseling, and addition or dose adjustment of various insulins or oral antihyperglycemic medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therapy was targeted to reduce mean HbA(1c) by &gt;or=1.0% over the monitoring period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>1,5AG, HbA(1c), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24103">fructosamine</z:chebi>, and random <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> measurements were performed at baseline and at 2, 4, and 8 weeks after the initiation of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 1,5AG, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24103">fructosamine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> values progressed significantly toward euglycemia by week 2 of monitoring (Wilcoxon's signed-rank test, P &lt; 0.05), with median changes of 93, -7, and -13% for 1,5AG, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24103">fructosamine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, HbA(1c) values did not respond significantly to therapy until week 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On an individual patient basis, 89.6% of patients displayed longitudinal changes of 1,5AG from baseline to week 8 in concordance with HbA(1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>1,5AG was also highly correlated with HbA(1c) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24103">fructosamine</z:chebi> (Spearman rho = -0.6459 and -0.6751, respectively; both P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that 1,5AG responds sensitively and rapidly to changes in glycemia and monitors glycemic control in accordance with established markers </plain></SENT>
