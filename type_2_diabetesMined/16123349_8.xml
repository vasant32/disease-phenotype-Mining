<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To assess the molecular changes associated with pancreatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta-cell dysfunction</z:hpo> occurring during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we profiled pancreatic islet <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> from diabetic male and high-fat-fed female <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats and their nondiabetic lean counterparts on custom islet-specific oligonucleotide arrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most prominent changes in both the male and female models of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were increases in the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> encoding proteases and extracellular matrix components that are associated with tissue remodeling and <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> for metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, -12, and -14 were sharply increased with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of islet dysfunction and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Zymography of islet extracts revealed a concurrent, &gt;10-fold increase in MMP-2 protease activity in islets from 9-week-old male ZDF rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment of female ZDF rats receiving a diabetogenic diet with PD166793, a broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor, substantially prevented <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effect of this compound was due in part to marked beta-cell expansion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These studies indicate that MMPs contribute to islet <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> and insulin insufficiency in ZDF rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Class-targeted <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37670">protease inhibitors</z:chebi> should be explored for their potential therapeutic utility in preservation of beta-cell mass in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
