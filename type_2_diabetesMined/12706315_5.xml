<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of the study was to determine whether genetic polymorphisms of the PON1 gene are associated with insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight Japanese patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were recruited, and euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp was performed to assess insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The PON1 promoter polymorphism C(-108)T was determined by direct sequencing, and the coding region polymorphism Q192R was determined by polymerase chain reaction and digestion of the amplified fragments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No association was observed between the Q192R polymorphism and the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion rate (GIR), whereas GIR increased with the following order of genotypes: -108TT &lt; -108CT &lt; and -108CC (4.2+/-1.6, 5.1+/-2.5, and 6.9+/-2.5 mg kg(-1) min(-1), respectively; P&lt;0.02, ANCOVA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stepwise regression analysis revealed that the C(-108)T polymorphism significantly contributed to the GIR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> attenuates insulin signaling in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The PON1 promoter polymorphism C(-108)T may influence insulin sensitivity by modulating serum <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> capacity </plain></SENT>
