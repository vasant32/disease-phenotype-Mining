<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 2,999 newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients recruited to the U.K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prospective <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study who were randomized to conventional or intensive <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control policies if their fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels remained &gt;6 mmol/l after a dietary run-in </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 2,484 patients (83%) were white Caucasian (WC), 265 patients (9%) were Afro-Caribbean (AC), and 250 patients (8%) were Asian of Indian origin (IA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Variables were assessed at 3, 6, and 9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the 9-year study period, body weight increased more in WC patients (mean 5.0 kg) than in AC (3.0 kg) and IA (2.5 kg) patients (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for age, sex, baseline value, treatment allocation, and change in weight, there were no consistent ethnic differences in mean change in fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> or HbA(1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> therapy, increase in systolic blood pressure at 9 years was greatest in AC patients (7 mmHg; P &lt; 0.01 vs. WC patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> decreased progressively during the 9 years in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In AC patients, the mean increase in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (0.16 mmol/l) at 3 years, maintained to 9 years, and the mean decrease in plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> level (0.4 mmol/l) at 9 years were greater than in WC and IA patients (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study shows important ethnic differences in body weight, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profiles, and blood pressure, but not glycemic control, during 9 years after diagnosis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>AC patients maintained the most favorable <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profiles, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> developed in more AC patients than WC or IA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Ethnicity-specific glycemic control of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> seems unnecessary, but other risk factors need to be addressed independently </plain></SENT>
