<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the effect of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Care Protocol on A1C and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> in type 2 diabetic patients in primary care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a cluster randomized trial, mean changes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> between the intervention and control groups after 1 year were calculated by generalized linear models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Throughout the Netherlands, 26 intervention practices included 1,699 patients and 29 control practices 1,692 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The difference in A1C change was not significant, whereas total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, and blood pressure improved significantly more in the intervention group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 10-year <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> risk estimate of the UK Prospective <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study improved 1.4% more in the intervention group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Delegation of routine <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care to a practice nurse combined with computerized decision support and feedback did not improve A1C but reduced cardiovascular risk in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
