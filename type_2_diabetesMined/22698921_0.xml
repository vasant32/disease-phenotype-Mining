<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the evidence derives from cross-sectional observational studies, retrospective studies, or short-term prospective studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This long-term prospective study of a large cohort of women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCOS</z:e>, followed from youth to middle age, aimed at estimating, for the first time, the incidence and potential predictors of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 255 women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCOS</z:e> were followed for at least 10 years (mean follow-up 16.9 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six women were patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at baseline, and another 42 women developed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence rate of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the study population was 1.05 per 100 person-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The age-standardized prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at the end of follow-up was 39.3%, which is significantly higher with respect to that of the general Italian female population of a similar age (5.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The likelihood of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> significantly increased as BMI, fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> area under the curve at baseline increased and significantly decreased as <z:chebi fb="25" ids="50112">sex hormone</z:chebi>-binding globulin (SHBG) levels at follow-up increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is markedly elevated in middle-aged women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCOS</z:e> and suggests including BMI, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and SHBG-circulating levels in the risk stratification </plain></SENT>
