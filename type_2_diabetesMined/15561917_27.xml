<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Amylin is a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25905">peptide hormone</z:chebi> that is cosecreted with insulin from the pancreatic beta-cell and is thus deficient in diabetic people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It inhibits glucagon secretion, delays gastric emptying, and acts as a satiety agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Amylin replacement could therefore possibly improve glycemic control in some people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, human amylin exhibits physicochemical properties predisposing the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25905">peptide hormone</z:chebi> to aggregate and form amyloid fibers, which may play a part in beta-cell destruction in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This obviously makes it unsuitable for pharmacological use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A stable analog, pramlintide, which has actions and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties similar to the native <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, has been developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The efficacy and safety of pramlintide administration has been tested in a vast number of clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Approximately 5,000 insulin-treated patients have received pramlintide and approximately 250 for &gt; or =2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The aims of this review are to 1) briefly describe actions of amylin as demonstrated in animal and human models and 2) primarily review results from clinical trials with the amylin analog pramlintide </plain></SENT>
