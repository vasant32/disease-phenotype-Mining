<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Subjects were 813 male and female participants in the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study, aged 40-69 years at baseline (1990-1994), and with a baseline fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &lt;7.0 mmol/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was identified in 1994-1998 by self-report and confirmation from doctors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eligible cases and a random group of controls were selected, with NMR data available for 59 cases and 754 non-cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Concentration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39027">very low density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>) particles (positive) and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>) particle size (negative) were selected by stepwise regression as predictors of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These associations were independent of other non-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> risk factors, but not plasma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Factor analysis identified a factor from NMR variables, explaining 47% of their variation, and characterized by a positive correlation with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>, particularly large and medium sized; more <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>) that were smaller; and relatively smaller, but not more <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> particles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This factor was positively associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence, but not independently of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We identified an atherogenic NMR <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> profile in people who developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but this did not improve <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prediction beyond conventional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
