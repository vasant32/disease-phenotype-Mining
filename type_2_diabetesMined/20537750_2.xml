<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Subjects completed generic and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-specific health-related quality-of-life measures (RAND-36 and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp>-39) and a symptom assessment measure (DSC-Revised) at baseline and 6 months post insulin initiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean score change was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Effect size (ES; Cohen's d) and analysis of covariance were used to examine extent and significance of change both within and between treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Subject characteristics were mean age 57 years, males 59%, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> 9.6 years, and baseline HbA1c 8.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the total sample, significant (P&lt;0.01) improvements (with small ES) were observed in four of eight RAND-36 subscales (ES range: 0.13-0.24), three of five <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp>-39 subscales (ES range: 0.09-0.34), and five of eight DSC-Revised subscales (ES range: 0.15-0.38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While significance of within-group changes varied by treatment, only one subscale (physical functioning for LM25) showed deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The changes were not significantly different (P&gt;0.01) between regimens for any subscales </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that insulin initiation improves selective PRO in patients with poorly controlled T2DM </plain></SENT>
