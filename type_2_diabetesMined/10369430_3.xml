<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was therefore to test the hypothesis that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018995" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">haemochromatosis</z:e> gene mutations Cys282Tyr and His63Asp are more prevalent in Type 2 diabetic patients compared with the Canterbury, New Zealand general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied 230 consecutive patients referred to the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Services with age &gt; or = 30 years and considered to have Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA was extracted from whole blood and amplified by polymerase chain reaction prior to restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the mutations was compared with that observed previously in 1064 subjects from the Canterbury general population by chi2 testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Iron was measured by a colorimetric method, transferrin by rate nephelometry and ferritin by immunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 2/230 (0.8%) Cys282Tyr homozygous subjects in the diabetic group compared with 5/1064 (0.5%) NS in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although there was a trend to lower incidence of Cys282Tyr heterozygosity in the diabetic group, there was no significant difference for any of the six genotype frequencies between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018995" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Haemochromatosis</z:e> gene mutations Cys282Tyr and His63Asp are therefore not increased in Type 2 diabetics compared with the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Transferrin saturation was a sensitive marker (100%) of genetic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018995" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">haemochromatosis</z:e>, although ferritin had low specificity (77.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Genetic susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018995" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">haemochromatosis</z:e> is not an important aetiological factor for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and targeted screening of diabetic patients for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018995" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">haemochromatosis</z:e> is not indicated </plain></SENT>
