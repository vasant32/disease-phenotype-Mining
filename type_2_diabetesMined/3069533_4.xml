<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The action of midaglizole as a platelet alpha 2-<z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> was confirmed by in vitro studies using platelet-rich plasma and washed platelet suspension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hypoglycaemia</z:e> was induced by a bolus injection of short-acting insulin in 24 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were divided into two groups, a control group (n = 12) and an alpha 2-group (n = 12), and midaglizole was administered orally 60 min before insulin injection in the latter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and plasma C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels were significantly decreased (p less than 0.005) by insulin injection in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Counter-regulatory hormones, including <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi>, and arginine vasopressin were similarly increased at the hypoglycaemic nadir compared with the levels at 0 min in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma beta-thromboglobulin was increased at the hypoglycaemic nadir (165.5 +/- 12.6 ng/ml) compared with the level at 0 min (121.0 +/- 11.5, p less than 0.005) in the control group, whereas no significant increase was demonstrated in the alpha 2-group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that plasma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi> plays an important role in platelet activation during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> in Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, and that the platelet activation is prevented by alpha 2-adrenoceptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
