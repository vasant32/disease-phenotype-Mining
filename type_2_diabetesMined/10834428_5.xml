<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and apo(e) polymorphisms among participants in the Framingham Offspring Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: During 1991-1995, subjects underwent a clinical examination and an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test with measurement of fasting and 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin levels, and fasting <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We measured <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> using the homeostasis model, in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-IR) = fasting insulin x <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>/22.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Apo(e) isoforms and phenotypes were determined in 1983-1987 using isoelectric focusing of plasma <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 2,120 subjects with complete HOMA-IR and apo(e) data, 204 with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The remainder were classified with features of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> syndrome including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (1997 American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association criteria), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (criteria from the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of <z:mp ids='MP_0002842'>High Blood Pressure</z:mp> [6th report]), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (BMI &gt;85th percentile), high waist-to-hip ratio (&gt;85th percentile), and high <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> and low <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> levels (NCEP-2 criteria) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We analyzed data with contingency tables and age- and sex-adjusted logistic regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 1,916 subjects, the mean age was 55 (range 28-83 years) and 51% were women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median HOMA-IR was 6.4 (interquartile range 5.2-8.2), and allele frequencies were 7.8, 79.9, and 12.4% for apo(e) alleles e2, e3, and e4, respectively There were no differences in proportions of apo(e) isoforms or alleles across increasing quintiles of HOMA-IR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A less dramatic increase in proportions occurred with elevated <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> associated with increasing HOMA-IR among those with apo(e) isoforms 2/2 and 2/3 compared with the others (P &lt; or = 0.01 for interaction) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Otherwise, apo(e) did not substantially modify associations between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and features of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is no association between apo(e) polymorphisms and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These appear to represent 2 completely independent risk factors for CHD </plain></SENT>
