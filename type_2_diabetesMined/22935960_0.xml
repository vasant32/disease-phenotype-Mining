<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this placebo-controlled randomised crossover study, the effect of oral NAC dosing on platelet-monocyte conjugation and intraplatelet GSH was investigated in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (eligibility criteria: men or post-menopausal women with well-controlled <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (HbA(1c) &lt; 10%), not on aspirin or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients (n = 14; age range 43-79 years, HbA(1c) = 6.9 ± 0.9% [52.3 ± 10.3 mmol/mol]) visited the Highland Clinical Research Facility, Inverness, UK on day 0 and day 7 for each arm of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood was sampled before and 2 h after oral administration of placebo or NAC (1,200 mg) on day 0 and day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients received placebo or NAC capsules for once-daily dosing on the intervening days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The order of administration of NAC and placebo was allocated by a central office and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and research staff involved in the study were blinded to the allocation until after the study was complete and the data fully analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome for the study was platelet-monocyte conjugation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Oral NAC reduced platelet-monocyte conjugation (from 53.1 ± 4.5% to 42.5 ± 3.9%) at 2 h after administration and the effect was maintained after 7 days of dosing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intraplatelet GSH was raised in individuals with depleted GSH and there was a negative correlation between baseline intraplatelet GSH and platelet-monocyte conjugation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The NAC-induced normalisation of intraplatelet GSH, coupled with a reduction in platelet-monocyte conjugation, suggests that NAC might help to reduce atherothrombotic risk in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
