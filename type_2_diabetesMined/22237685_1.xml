<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) is induced by ER stress and has a central role in apoptotic execution pathways triggered by ER stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to characterise the role of CHOP in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Metabolic studies were performed in Chop ( -/- ) and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> C57Bl/6 mice, and included euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamps and indirect calorimetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The inflammatory state of liver and adipose tissue was determined by quantitative RT-PCR, immunohistology and macrophage cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Viability and absence of ER stress in islets of Langerhans was determined by electron microscopy, islet culture and quantitative RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Systemic deletion of Chop induced abdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>hepatic steatosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, Chop ( -/- ) mice had preserved <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance and insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This discrepancy was accompanied by lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and less infiltration of immune cells into fat and liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These observations suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> is not induced by fat accumulation per se, but rather by the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> induced by ectopic fat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CHOP may play a key role in the crosstalk between excessive fat deposition and induction of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>-mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
