<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, no previous study has evaluated <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> mellitus (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e>) risk in relation to <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> iron intake during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated associations of maternal preconceptional and early pregnancy <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> and nonheme iron intake with subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of 3,158 pregnant women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A food frequency questionnaire was used to assess maternal diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariable generalized linear regression models were used to derive estimates of relative risks (RRs) and 95% CIs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Approximately 5.0% of the cohort developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> (n=158) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">Heme</z:chebi> iron intake was positively and significantly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> risk (Ptrend=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for confounders, women reporting the highest <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> iron intake levels (â‰¥1.52 vs. &lt;0.48 mg per day) experienced a 3.31-fold-increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> risk (95% CI 1.02-10.72) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In fully adjusted models, we noted that a 1-mg per day increase in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> iron was associated with a 51% increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> risk (RR 1.51 [95% CI 0.99-2.36]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nonheme iron was inversely, though not statistically significantly, associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> risk, and the corresponding RRs were 1.00, 0.83, 0.62, and 0.61 across quartiles of nonheme iron intake (Ptrend=0.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High levels of dietary <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> iron intake during the preconceptional and early pregnancy period may be associated with increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Associations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> risk with dietary nonheme iron intake are less clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Confirmation of these findings by future studies is warranted </plain></SENT>
