<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>Weight loss</z:hpo> was 2, 3, and 3 kg after 5, 10, and 20 days, respectively; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the weight lost was body fat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FBG) levels fell from 11.9 +/- 1.4 at baseline to 8.9 +/- 1.6, 7.9 +/- 1.4, and 8.8 +/- 1.3 mmol/l at days 5, 10, and 20, respectively (P &lt; 0.05, baseline vs. 5, 10, and 20 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Endogenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production (EGP) was 22 +/- 2, 18 +/- 2, 17 +/- 2, and 22 +/- 2 pmol x kg(-1) lean body mass (LBM) x min(-1) (P &lt; 0.05, days 5 and 10 vs. baseline) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gluconeogenesis measured by mass isotopomer distribution analysis provided 31 +/- 4, 41 +/- 5, 40 +/- 4, and 33 +/- 4%, respectively, of the EGP (NS); absolute glycogenolytic contribution to the EGP was 15 +/- 2, 11 +/- 2, 11 +/- 2, and 15 +/- 2 pmol x kg(-1) LBM x min(-1), respectively (P &lt; 0.001, baseline vs. days 5 and 10 and day 10 vs. day 20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> clearance rate increased significantly at day 20 (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neither lipolysis nor flux of plasma nonesterified fatty acids were altered compared with baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, severe energy restriction per se independent of major changes in body composition reduces both FBG concentration and EGP in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the reduction in EGP results entirely from a reduction of glycogenolytic input into blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and the duration of reduced glycogenolysis is short-lived after relaxation of energy restriction even without <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>, but effects on plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> clearance persist and partially maintain the improvement in fasting glycemia </plain></SENT>
