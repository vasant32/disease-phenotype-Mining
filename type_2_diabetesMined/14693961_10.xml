<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> mellitus (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e>) and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> share certain pathophysiological mechanisms, few studies have examined <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We prospectively examined routine leukocyte counts collected at the first prenatal visit in a cohort of 2,753 nulliparous euglycemic women, 98 (3.6%) of whom were later diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects were divided into quartiles of leukocyte count, and the results of third-trimester <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> screening tests and the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> among these quartiles were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression was used to calculate univariate and multivariable-adjusted relative risks (RRs) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> according to leukocyte quartiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Leukocyte counts were increased among women who subsequently developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> compared with those who remained free of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> (10.5 +/- 2.2 vs. 9.2 +/- 2.2 x 10(3) cells/ml; P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a linear increase in postloading mean <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels (P for trend &lt;0.01), the area under the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test curves (P for trend &lt;0.01), and the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> (quartile 1, 1.1; quartile 2, 2.5; quartile 3, 4.2; and quartile 4, 6.4%; P for trend &lt;0.01) with increasing leukocyte quartiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the multivariable-adjusted analysis, the linear trend in the RR of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> with increasing leukocyte quartiles remained statistically significant (quartile 1, reference; quartile 2, RR 2.3 [95% CI 0.9-5.7]; quartile 3, 3.3 [1.4-7.8]; quartile 4, 4.9 [2.1-11.2]; P for trend &lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mp ids='MP_0000218'>Increased leukocyte count</z:mp> early in pregnancy is independently and linearly associated with the results of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> screening tests and the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although overlap in the leukocyte count distributions precludes it from being a clinically useful biomarker, these data suggest that <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> is associated with the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> and may be another pathophysiological link between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> and future type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
