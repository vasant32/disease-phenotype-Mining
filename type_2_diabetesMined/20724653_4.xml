<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the prognostic value of gated myocardial perfusion single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> computed tomography (SPECT) for asymptomatic diabetic patients in a Japanese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Asymptomatic patients (n=485) aged≥50 years with either a maximal carotid artery intima-media thickness of ≥1.1 mm, or a urinary albumin ≥30 mg/g <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> or who had at least two of the following, abdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003233'>low HDL cholesterol</z:hpo>, high <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, were enrolled at 50 institutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were evaluated using gated SPECT with the stress-rest protocol and followed up for 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the follow-up period, 62 (13%) events occurred, including 5 cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> and 57 cardiovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with summed stress scores (SSS) of ≥9 had a significantly higher incidence (of either <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or cardiovascular events) than those with SSS scores of &lt;9 (23 vs. 12%; P=0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that significant variables were SSS≥9, a low estimated glomerular filtration rate, and being a current smoker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Univariate Cox regression analysis showed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi> and insulin use are potent medical modulators of cardiovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The incidences of cardiovascular events and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were significantly high in a select population of type 2 diabetic patients with SPECT abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A targeted treatment strategy is required for asymptomatic but potentially high-risk patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
