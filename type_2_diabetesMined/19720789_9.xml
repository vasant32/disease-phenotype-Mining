<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 13 FDR and 20 CON subjects participated in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were studied before and after 9 days of bed rest using the clamp technique combined with indirect calorimetry preceded by an intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> turnover rates were studied using stable isotope kinetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Bed rest caused a significant decrease in whole-body insulin sensitivity in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hepatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> was elevated in FDR subjects prior to bed rest and was significantly augmented by bed rest in FDR (P &lt; 0.01) but not in CON (P = NS) subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rate of whole-body lipolysis decreased during bed rest in both FDR and CON subjects, with no significant differences between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo> induced by bed rest was fully accounted for by the impairment of nonoxidative <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in both groups (overall P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Whole-body insulin action in both insulin-resistant FDR and healthy CON subjects deteriorates with 9 days of bed rest, converging toward similar degrees of whole-body <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>FDR subjects exhibit hepatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HIR), which, in contrast to CON subjects, deteriorates in response to physical inactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>FDR subjects exhibit <z:mp ids='MP_0003059'>reduced insulin secretion</z:mp> when seen in relation to their degree of HIR but not peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
