<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We have previously shown that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000044'>hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism</z:hpo> is common in middle-aged patients with type 2, but not with type 1, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have now investigated the total and free <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> concentrations in young (aged 18-35 years) type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this study carried out in a tertiary referral center, serum concentrations of total and free <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> were measured in 38 type 1 diabetic (mean age 26.45 +/- 0.89 years) and 24 type 2 diabetic (mean age 27.87 +/- 0.97 years) subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean BMI of type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients was 27.41 +/- 1.18 and 38.55 +/- 2.04 kg/m(2), respectively (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean total <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> concentration of type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients was 22.89 +/- 1.23 and 11.14 +/- 0.99 nmol/l, respectively (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean free <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> concentration of type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients was 0.489 +/- 0.030 and 0.296 +/- 0.022 nmol/l, respectively (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight of 24 (33%) type 2 diabetic patients had subnormal free <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> concentrations (&lt;0.225 nmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using an age-based reference range, 14 of 24 (58%) type 2 diabetic patients had low free <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> concentrations (&lt;0.278 nmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three of 38 (8%) type 1 diabetic patients had free <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> concentrations below the lower limit of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (P = 0.02 when compared with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentrations in type 2 diabetic patients with low free <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> concentrations were in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range and were similar to those in type 1 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Young type 2 diabetic patients have significantly lower plasma concentrations of total and free <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> and inappropriately low LH and FSH concentrations with a very high prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000044'>hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism</z:hpo>, when compared with type 1 diabetic patients of a comparable age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The potential implications for their sexual and reproductive function during prime reproductive years are profound </plain></SENT>
