<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanism of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> amelioration by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">imatinib</z:chebi> is unknown, and it is uncertain whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">imatinib</z:chebi> has effects on type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> itself without other confounding diseases like <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">imatinib</z:chebi> on <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in db/db mice and investigated possible mechanism's underlying improved glycemic control by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">imatinib</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> tolerance and insulin tolerance tests were done after daily intraperitoneal injection of 25 mg/kg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">imatinib</z:chebi> into db/db and C57BL/6 mice for 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Insulin signaling and endoplasmic reticulum stress responses were studied by Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>beta-Cell mass and apoptotic beta-cell number were determined by combined terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining and insulin immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The in vitro effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">imatinib</z:chebi> was studied using HepG2 cells </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress markers in the liver and adipose tissues of db/db mice, such as phospho-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="17300">PERK</z:chebi>, phospho-eIF2alpha, TRB3, CHOP, and phospho-c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase, was reduced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">imatinib</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Insulin receptor substrate-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and Akt phosphorylation after insulin administration were improved by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">imatinib</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Serum aminotransferase levels and hepatic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> contents were decreased by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">imatinib</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Pancreatic beta-cell mass was increased by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">imatinib</z:chebi>, accompanied by decreased TUNEL(+) beta-cell and increased BrdU(+) beta-cell numbers </plain></SENT>
