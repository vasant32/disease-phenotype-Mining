<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although there are studies examining the relationship between serum FGF21 levels and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis, the role of FGF21 remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to examine whether serum FGF21 levels are associated with metabolic parameters in subjects with varying degrees of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance and with complications in subjects with type2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study consisted of 213 subjects who were lean and had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (lean NGT), were overweight with NGT, had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) or had T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum FGF21 levels and their associations with the parameters of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e>, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance and the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The serum FGF21 levels in T2DM were higher than in lean NGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum FGF21 levels showed a positive correlation with the urine albumin-to-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio (ACR) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects except for the T2DM subjects, who showed a correlation after adjustment of age, gender and body mass index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the subjects with carotid artery plaque showed higher serum FGF21 levels than those without complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Serum FGF21 levels were associated with the urine ACR and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> including carotid artery plaque </plain></SENT>
