<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated platelet nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> generation stimulated by beta-adrenoceptors and adenylyl cyclase in Type 2 diabetic patients and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Platelets isolated from blood taken from nine Type 2 diabetic patients and nine healthy control subjects of similar age were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> 1 micro mol/l, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42471">forskolin</z:chebi> 1 micro mol/l or vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Platelet nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase activity was measured by L-[(3)H]-arginine to L-[(3)H]-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18211">citrulline</z:chebi> conversion, cyclic <z:chebi fb="10" ids="17345">GMP</z:chebi> content by radioimmunoassay, and nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase type 3 expression by western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Basal platelet nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase activity was lower in diabetic patients than in control subjects (0.01+/-0.02 pmol <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16349">L-citrulline</z:chebi>/10(8) platelets, compared with 0.12+/-0.05; p&lt;0.05), although no corresponding difference was seen in basal platelet cyclic <z:chebi fb="10" ids="17345">GMP</z:chebi> (0.61+/-0.39 and 0.13+/-0.22 pmol cyclic <z:chebi fb="10" ids="17345">GMP</z:chebi>/10(8) platelets respectively; p=0.37) </plain></SENT>
