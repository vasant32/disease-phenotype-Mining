<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of three cohorts: the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) I and II and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">Antihypertensive</z:chebi> medication use was ascertained by biennial questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After excluding participants who reported a history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at baseline, 41,193 older women (NHS I), 14,151 younger women (NHS II), and 19,472 men (HPFS), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, were followed for 8, 10, and 16 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We documented 3,589 incident cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for age, BMI, physical activity, the use of other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> medications, and other risk factors, the multivariate relative risk (RR) of incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in participants taking a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50264">thiazide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretic</z:chebi> compared with those not taking a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50264">thiazide</z:chebi> was 1.20 (95% CI 1.08-1.33) in older women, 1.45 (1.17-1.79) in younger women, and 1.36 (1.17-1.58) in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The multivariate RR in participants taking a beta-blocker compared with those not taking a beta-blocker was 1.32 (1.20-1.46) in older women and 1.20 (1.05-1.38) in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitors</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38215">calcium channel blockers</z:chebi> were not associated with risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50264">Thiazide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretic</z:chebi> and beta-blocker use were independently associated with a higher risk of incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Increased surveillance for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in patients treated with these medications may be warranted </plain></SENT>
