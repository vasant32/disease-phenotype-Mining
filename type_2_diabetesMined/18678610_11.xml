<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients (n = 126) were randomly assigned to 12 weeks of therapy with Technosphere insulin or Technosphere powder after lifestyle education on nutrition, exercise, and instructions on inhaler use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary efficacy outcome was change in A1C from baseline to study end, and the secondary efficacy outcome was area under the curve for postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels during a meal test at treatment weeks 4, 8, and 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A1C reduction from a mean baseline of 7.9% was greater with Technosphere insulin than with Technosphere powder (-0.72 vs. -0.30%; P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excursions were reduced by 56% with Technosphere insulin compared with baseline, and maximal postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were reduced by 43% compared with Technosphere powder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Incidences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, cough, and other adverse events were low in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Body weight was unchanged in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Technosphere insulin was well tolerated and demonstrated significant improvement in glycemic control with clinically meaningful reductions in A1C levels and postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations after 12 weeks of treatment </plain></SENT>
