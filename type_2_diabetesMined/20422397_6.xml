<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we examined if exercise training could increase intrinsic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> function in diabetic patients compared with control individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifteen male type 2 diabetic patients and 14 male control individuals matched for age, BMI and VO(2max) enrolled in a 12 week exercise intervention programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ex vivo <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> function was assessed by high-resolution respirometry in permeabilised muscle fibres from vastus lateralis muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Before and after training, insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal was examined during a hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Diabetic patients had intrinsically lower <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-stimulated state 3 respiration and lower <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23019">carbonyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="53" ids="17514">cyanide</z:chebi> 4-(trifluoro-<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32772">methoxy</z:chebi>)phenylhydrazone (FCCP)-induced maximal oxidative respiration, both on <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> and on <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> and succinate, and in the presence of palmitoyl-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi> (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After training, diabetic patients and control individuals showed increased state 3 respiration on the previously mentioned substrates (p &lt; 0.05); however, an increase in FCCP-induced maximal oxidative respiration was observed only in diabetic patients (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> respiration was accompanied by a 30% increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> content upon training (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> density, state 3 and FCCP-induced maximal oxidative respiration were similar between groups after training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Improvements in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> respiration were paralleled by improvements in insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal in diabetic patients, with a tendency for this in control individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We confirmed lower intrinsic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> function in diabetic patients compared with control individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Diabetic patients increased their <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> content to the same extent as control individuals and had similar intrinsic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> function, which occurred parallel with improved insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
