<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Decreased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17268">myo-inositol</z:chebi> levels and increased activity of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26191">polyol</z:chebi> pathway have been proposed to play a role in causing diabetic microvascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are few clinical methods for examining the activity of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26191">polyol</z:chebi> pathway in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed the effect of changes in glycemic control on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26191">polyol</z:chebi> pathway activity by measuring urinary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26191">polyol</z:chebi> excretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Gas-chromatography/mass-spectrometry (GC/MS) was used to assess the urinary excretion of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26191">polyols</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17268">myo-inositol</z:chebi>, sorbitol, and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28757">fructose</z:chebi>) in 50 patients who had type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> and 20 healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the diabetic patients with poor glycemic control, urinary sorbitol levels were significantly increased and urinary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17268">myo-inositol</z:chebi> excretion was approximately 6.5-fold higher than in healthy controls (33.0+/-6.5 vs 221.7+/-45.9 mg/day, mean+/-SE, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During strict glycemic control, some patients (Group A) showed simultaneous disappearance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003076'>glucosuria</z:hpo> and normalization of the urinary excretion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17268">myo-inositol</z:chebi> (&lt;50 mg/day) and, while others (Group B) showed delayed normalization of urinary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17268">myo-inositol</z:chebi> excretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Group B showed significantly higher urinary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17268">myo-inositol</z:chebi>, sorbitol, and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28757">fructose</z:chebi> excretion than Group A at the time of disappearance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003076'>glucosuria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that patients in Group B may have increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26191">polyol</z:chebi> pathway activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Even though short-term strict glycemic regulations were established in long-standing hyperglycemic diabetic patients, to normalize the once-exaggerated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26191">polyol</z:chebi> pathway activities, it was essential to maintain <z:hpo ids='HP_0003076'>glucosuria</z:hpo>-free conditions for some period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Quantitation of urinary <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26191">polyols</z:chebi> using GC/MS appears to be a clinically useful method for assessing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26191">polyol</z:chebi> pathway activity </plain></SENT>
