<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to obtain reliable risk estimates for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and the association with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, comorbidity and lifestyle in a large cohort of type 2 diabetic patients in the UK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using the General Practice Research Database, we identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who had type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and were aged 35 to 89 years on 1 January 1992 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also identified five comparison subjects without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and of the same age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hazard ratios (HRs) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> between January 1992 and October 1999 were calculated, and the association with age, sex, body mass index, smoking, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The absolute rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was 11.91 per 1,000 person-years (95% CI 11.41-12.43) in people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 41,799) and 5.55 per 1,000 person-years (95% CI 5.40-5.70) in the comparison group (n = 202,733) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The age-adjusted HR for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in type 2 diabetic compared with non-diabetic subjects was 2.19 (95% CI 2.09-2.32) overall, 2.08 (95% CI 1.94-2.24) in men and 2.32 (95% CI 2.16-2.49) in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The increase in risk attributable to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was highest among young women (HR 8.18; 95% CI 4.31-15.51) and decreased with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No investigated comorbidity or lifestyle characteristic emerged as a major contributor to risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: This study provides risk estimates for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> for an unselected population from UK general practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were at an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, which decreased with age and was higher in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Additional risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in type 2 diabetic patients included duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, smoking, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
