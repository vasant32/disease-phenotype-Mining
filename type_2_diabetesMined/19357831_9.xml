<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Previous findings in rodents used as a model of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> suggest that insulin activation of atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) is impaired in muscle, but, unexpectedly, conserved in liver, despite impaired hepatic protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Moreover, aPKC at least partly regulates two major transactivators: (1) hepatic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15889">sterol</z:chebi> receptor binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), which controls <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> synthesis; and (2) nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB), which promotes <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In Goto-Kakizaki rats used as a model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we examined: (1) whether differences in hepatic aPKC and PKB activation reflect differences in activation of IRS-1- and IRS-2-dependent phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K); (2) whether hepatic SREBP-1c and NFkappaB are excessively activated by aPKC; and (3) metabolic consequences of excessive activation of hepatic aPKC, SREBP-1c and NFkappaB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In liver, as well as in muscle, IRS-2/PI3K activation by insulin was intact, whereas IRS-1/PI3K activation by insulin was impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, hepatic IRS-2 is known to control hepatic aPKC during insulin activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Against this background, selective inhibition of hepatic aPKC by adenoviral-mediated expression of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> encoding kinase-inactive aPKC or short hairpin <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> targeting Irs2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and partially depleting hepatic IRS-2 diminished hepatic SREBP-1c production and NFkappaB activities, concomitantly improving serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and insulin signalling in muscle and liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similar improvements in SREBP-1c, NFkappaB and insulin signalling were seen in ob/ob mice following inhibition of hepatic aPKC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In diabetic rodent liver, diminished PKB activation may largely reflect impaired IRS-1/PI3K activation, while conserved aPKC activation reflects retained IRS-2/PI3K activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hepatic aPKC may also contribute importantly to excessive SREPB-1c and NFkappaB activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Excessive hepatic aPKC-dependent activation of SREBP-1c and NFkappaB may contribute importantly to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020473" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperlipidaemia</z:e> and systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
