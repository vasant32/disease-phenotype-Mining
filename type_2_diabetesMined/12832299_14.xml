<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The subjects consisted of 248 male and 304 female adult nondiabetic relatives of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dietary intake was measured by means of two 3-day food records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Associations of total, water-insoluble, and water-soluble fiber with measures of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism based on an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test, were analyzed by multiple linear regression analysis adjusting for sex, age, length of education, physical activity, BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, systolic blood pressure, and serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The homeostasis model assessment <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> index, the incremental 30-min serum insulin concentration divided by the incremental 30-min <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration, and fasting and 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations were the outcome variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The dietary intake of total as well as water-insoluble and water-soluble fiber was inversely associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>: -0.17 (0.07), P = 0.012; -0.15 (0.07), P = 0.024; and -0.14 (0.07), P = 0.049 [regression coefficients (SE)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fiber variables were unrelated to insulin secretion and plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results support evidence that a high intake of dietary fiber is associated with enhanced insulin sensitivity and therefore may have a role in the prevention of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
