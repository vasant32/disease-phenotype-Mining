<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This article aims to provide an updated summary of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention efforts by reviewing relevant literature published between 2007 and 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These include results from the long-term follow-up of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention trials and the roll-out of community-based interventions in "real world" settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Some countries have begun to implement population-based strategies for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disease prevention, but investment in developing and evaluating population-level interventions remains inadequate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By focussing on the "small change" approach and involving a number of different agencies, it may be possible to shift the population distribution of risk factors for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> in a favourable direction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cost-effectiveness of primary prevention strategies for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> has not been universally demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Some of the uncertainties relating to screening for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have now been resolved but longer-term data on hard cardiovascular outcomes are still needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In summary, individual countries should aim to develop and evaluate cost-effective, setting-specific <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk identification and prevention strategies based on available resources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These should be linked to initiatives aimed at reducing the burden of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, and complemented with population-based strategies focusing on the control and reduction of behavioural and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> by targeting their key determinants </plain></SENT>
