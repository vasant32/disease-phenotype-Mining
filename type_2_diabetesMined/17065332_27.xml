<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The islet microvasculature was increased approximately twofold in young male ZDF rats by both morphometric analysis and quantifying <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of endothelial markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ZDF rats at 12 weeks of age showed a significant reduction in the number of endothelial cells, which was prevented by pretreatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Light and electron microscopy of normoglycemic 7-week-old ZDF rats showed thickened endothelial cells with loss of endothelial fenestrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By 12 weeks of age, there was disruption of the endothelium and intra-islet <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Islets from 7- and 12-week-old ZDF rats showed an approximate three- and twofold increase in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and VEGF protein secretion, respectively, compared with lean controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thrombospondin-1 mRNA increased in 7- and 12-week-old rats by 2- and 10-fold, respectively, and was reduced by 50% in 12-week-old rats pretreated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Islets from young male control rats induced migration of endothelial cells in a collagen matrix only after pretreatment with matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Islets from 7-week-old ZDF rats showed a fivefold increase in migration score compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> controls, even without MMP-9 treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Islets from 15-week-old ZDF rats did not induce migration; rather, they caused a significant rounding up of the duct-derived cells, suggesting a toxic effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that in the ZDF rat model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, an inability of the islet to maintain vascular integrity may contribute to beta-cell failure </plain></SENT>
