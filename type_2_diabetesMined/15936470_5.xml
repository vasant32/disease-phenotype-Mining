<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 725 eligible type 2 diabetics received DR screening during 1999-2002 and then evaluated utility values in 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of DR was performed by a panel of ophthalmologists using ophthalmoscopy and a 45-degree color <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> photographs to examine fundus after dilating pupils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The utility values were measured by using time trade-off method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 406 type 2 diabetics participating the utility survey with 56% response rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall mean utility value was 0.92+/-0.12 (95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.91-0.93) suggesting that type 2 diabetics were willing to trade about 8% (95%CI: 7-9%) of their remaining life in return for being free of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> perpetually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The significant associated factors of utility values based on the multiple linear regression analysis were older age and different degrees of DR among type 2 diabetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our results found that in addition to older age, different degrees of DR do decrease utility values in type 2 diabetics from the patient's preference-based viewpoint </plain></SENT>
