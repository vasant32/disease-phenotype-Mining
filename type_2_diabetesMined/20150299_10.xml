<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Baseline data from a type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-management randomized trial with 463 adults having elevated BMI (M = 34.8 kg/m(2)) were used to investigate relations among demographic, psychosocial, and social-environmental variables; dietary, exercise, and medication-taking behaviors; and biologic outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Self-efficacy, problem solving, and social-environmental support were independently associated with diet and exercise, increasing the variance accounted for by 23 and 19%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only diet contributed to explained variance in BMI (beta = -0.17, P = 0.0003) and self-rated health status (beta = 0.25, P &lt; 0.0001); and only medication-taking behaviors contributed to <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> ratio (total-to-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>) (beta = -0.20, P = 0.0001) and A1C (beta = -0.21, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Interventions should focus on enhancing self-efficacy, problem solving, and social-environmental support to improve self-management of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
