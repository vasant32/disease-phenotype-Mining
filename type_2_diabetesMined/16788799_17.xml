<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the contribution made by ADIPOQ gene variants to glycaemic status in southern Chinese individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Sixty unrelated subjects were screened for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the ADIPOQ gene by direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The association of tagging SNPs with the outcome of glycaemic status in 262 subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) was examined in a 5-year prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 15 polymorphisms in the ADIPOQ gene, ten of them constituting the tagging SNPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 5 years, 39.7% of the subjects with IGT had regressed to NGT, 41.2% had persistent IGT or impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and 19.1% had developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only the T45G polymorphism was associated with persistent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> at 5 years (p=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Haplotypes formed by the addition of other SNPs, as haplotype blocks or pairs, did not confer greater association than T45G alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On logistic regression analysis, T45G independently predicted persistent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> at 5 years (OR=2.25, 95% CI 1.29-3.95, G carriers vs TT; p=0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It also predicted persistent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> in a nested case-control study involving 158 sex- and age-matched controls with persistent NGT (p=0.012, adjusted for BMI), and that of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or glycaemia progression (p&lt;0.05) in a meta-analysis that also included two published studies in Europid subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our findings support a significant role of this common ADIPOQ gene polymorphism in predicting glycaemic status in southern Chinese people </plain></SENT>
