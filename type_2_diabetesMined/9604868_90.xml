<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Upper body <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> is a risk factor for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known about the regulation of body fat distribution, but leptin may be involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examined the secretion of leptin in subcutaneous and omental fat tissue in 15 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and 8 nonobese women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Leptin secretion rates were two to three times higher in subcutaneous than in omental fat tissue in both <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and nonobese women (P &lt; 0.0001 and P &lt; 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a positive correlation between BMI and leptin secretion rates in both subcutaneous (r = 0.87, P &lt; 0.0001) and omental (r = 0.74, P &lt; 0.0001) fat tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, leptin secretion rates in subcutaneous and omental fat tissue correlated well with serum leptin levels (r = 0.84, P &lt; 0.0001 and r = 0.73, P = 0.001, respectively), although in multivariate analysis, the subcutaneous leptin secretion rate was the major regressor for serum leptin (F = 42) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subcutaneous fat cells were approximately 50% larger than omental fat cells, and there was a positive correlation between fat cell size and leptin secretion rate in both fat depots (r = 0.8, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Leptin (but not gamma-actin) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were twofold higher in subcutaneous than in omental fat tissue (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus the subcutaneous fat depot is the major source of leptin in women owing to the combination of a mass effect (subcutaneous fat being the major depot) and a higher secretion rate in the subcutaneous than in the visceral region, which in turn could be due to <z:mp ids='MP_0000354'>increased cell size</z:mp> and leptin gene expression </plain></SENT>
