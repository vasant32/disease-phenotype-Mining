<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are two <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi> shuttles: the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> phosphate and malate-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> shuttle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mice with a targeted disruption of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi>-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, a rate-limiting enzyme of the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> phosphate shuttle, are not diabetic and have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> islet <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we analyzed if environmental factors, such as a high carbohydrate diet could contribute to the development of Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> in mice with a specific defective genetic background </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The mice were fed with a high carbohydrate diet for 1 and 6 months, and several biochemical parameters were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> respiratory activity was assayed by polarography; and the islet function was studied by islet perifusion and pancreas perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The high carbohydrate diet induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020459" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperinsulinaemia</z:e>, and islet <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and heterozygote mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Activity of the respiratory chain complex I also increased in these mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, these effects were not observed in the null mice fed with the diet; in addition, these null mice had an <z:mp ids='MP_0002891'>increased insulin sensitivity</z:mp> compared to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: The phenotype of the mice with an impairment of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi> shuttles does not worsen when fed a high carbohydrate diet; moreover, the diet does not compromise islet function </plain></SENT>
