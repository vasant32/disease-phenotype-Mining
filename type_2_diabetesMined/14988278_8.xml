<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been proposed that type 1 and 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> might share common pathophysiological pathways and, to some extent, genetic background </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, to date there has been no convincing data to establish a molecular genetic link between them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have genotyped three single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a large type 1 diabetic family collection of European descent: Gly972Arg in the insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) gene, Glu23Lys in the <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> inwardly-rectifying channel gene (KCNJ11), and Pro12Ala in the peroxisome proliferative-activated receptor gamma2 gene (PPARG2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We were unable to confirm a recently published association of the IRS1 Gly972Arg variant with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, KCNJ11 Glu23Lys showed no association with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the PPARG2 Pro12Ala variant showed evidence of association (RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.04-1.28, P = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additional studies need to be conducted to confirm this result </plain></SENT>
