<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A prospective, randomized, repeated measures study was conducted on the Texas-Mexico border in Starr County </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 256 randomly selected individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> between 35 and 70 years of age, diagnosed with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after 35 years of age, and accompanied by a family member or friend were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The intervention consisted of 52 contact hours over 12 months and was provided by bilingual Mexican American nurses, dietitians, and community workers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The intervention involved 3 months of weekly instructional sessions on nutrition, self-monitoring of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, exercise, and other self-care topics and 6 months of biweekly support group sessions to promote behavior changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The approach was culturally competent in terms of language, diet, social emphasis, family participation, and incorporation of cultural health beliefs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Outcomes included indicators of metabolic control (HbA(1c) and fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>), <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> knowledge, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related health beliefs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Experimental groups showed significantly lower levels of HbA(1c) and fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> at 6 and 12 months and higher <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> knowledge scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 6 months, the mean HbA(1c) of the experimental subjects was 1.4% below the mean of the control group; however, the mean level of the experimental subjects was still high (&gt;10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the effectiveness of culturally competent <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-management education on improving health outcomes of Mexican Americans, particularly for those individuals with HbA(1c) levels &gt;10% </plain></SENT>
