<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scales are child self-report and parent proxy-report scales developed as the generic core measure to be integrated with the PedsQL disease-specific modules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The electronic version of the PedsQL 4.0 (ePedsQL) was designed for Internet administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Utilizing a randomized crossover design, the PedsQL scales were administered to 92 pediatric patients with type 1 or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 93 parents in electronic and paper formats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Missing values (0.76% child report, 0.37% parent report), internal consistency reliability (total scale score alpha = 0.90 child report, 0.92 parent report), and mean scores (total scale score M = 78.41 child report, 76.19 parent report) were equivalent between the electronic and paper-and-pencil modes of administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ePedsQL distinguished between healthy children and children with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The ePedsQL Internet mode of administration demonstrated equivalent measurement properties to the well-established PedsQL paper-and-pencil mode of administration </plain></SENT>
