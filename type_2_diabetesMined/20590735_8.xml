<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seven hundred and thirty-two patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> completed a 77-item questionnaire during a randomized, 52-week, double-blind study with liraglutide 1.2 mg (n = 245) or 1.8 mg (n = 242) compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> 8 mg (n = 245) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean (SE) decreases in glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> levels were greater with liraglutide 1.2 mg [-0.84 (0.08)%] and 1.8 mg [-1.14 (0.08)%] than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> [-0.51 (0.08)%; p = 0.0014 and p &lt; 0.0001, respectively] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients gained weight on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> [mean (SE), 1.12 (0.27) kg] but lost weight on liraglutide [1.2 mg: -2.05 (0.28) kg; 1.8 mg: -2.45 (0.28) kg; both p &lt; 0.0001] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patient weight assessment was more favourable with liraglutide 1.8 mg [mean (SE) score: 40.0 (2.0)] than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> [48.7 (2.0); p = 0.002], and liraglutide 1.8 mg patients were 52% less likely to feel overweight [odds ratio (OR) 0.48; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.331-0.696] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean (SE) weight concerns were less with liraglutide [1.2 mg: 30.0 (1.2); 1.8 mg: 32.8 (1.2)] than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> [38.8 (1.2); p &lt; 0.0001 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively], with liraglutide groups 45% less likely to report weight concern (OR 0.55, 95% CI: 0.41-0.73) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean (SE) mental and emotional health and general perceived health improved more with liraglutide 1.8 mg [476.1 (2.8) and 444.2 (3.2), respectively] than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> [466.3 (2.8) and 434.5 (3.2), respectively; p = 0.012 and p = 0.033, respectively] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Improved glycaemic control and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004325'>decreased weight</z:hpo> with liraglutide 1.8 mg vs. <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> can improve psychological and emotional well-being and health perceptions by reducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and worry associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
