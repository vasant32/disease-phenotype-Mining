<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty healthy volunteers served as control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hundred and thirty-eight newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients had been treated with TIIT for 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TNF-alpha, free fatty acids (FFAs), <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and insulin (INS) had been measured before and after TIIT, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) was used to estimate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-IR) and islet beta-Cell function (HOMA-beta) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TNF-alpha was significantly increased in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After TIIT, TNF-alpha, fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, FFAs, and HOMA-IR were significantly decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HOMA-beta and the areas under the curves of INS were significantly increased during intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TNF-alpha had not only significant negative correlation with the changes of insulin secretion, but also significant positive correlation with the changes of HOMA-IR after adjustment of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Partial correlation analyses demonstrated that there was an indepenent relationship between TNF-alpha and HOMA-IR and HOMA-beta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our study confirms that TIIT can effectively decrease serum TNF-alpha in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is inferred that the decrease of serum TNF-alpha might be involved in the improvement of beta-Cell function and the decrease of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> by TIIT </plain></SENT>
