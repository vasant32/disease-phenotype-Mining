<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: We examined the effects of the 11Î²-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35350">hydroxysteroid</z:chebi> dehydrogenase type 1 (HSD1) inhibitor, MK-0916, on the multiple components of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> (MetS) in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2DM) and MetS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a 12-week, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with T2DM (mean baseline A1C: 7.3%) and National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP III)-defined MetS were randomized 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 to 0.5, 2 or 6 mg/day MK-0916 or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary efficacy endpoint was a change from baseline at week 12 in fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Secondary endpoints included glycosylated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c) (A1C), 2-h postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (2-h <z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi>), body weight, waist circumference, blood pressure and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treatment with MK-0916 had no significant effect relative to placebo on FPG at week 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared to placebo, 6 mg MK-0916 produced a modest, significant (p = 0.049) reduction in A1C of 0.3% at week 12, but no significant difference was observed in 2-h <z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six milligram MK-0916 increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> relative to placebo by 10.4% (p = 0.041) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment with MK-0916 led to modest dose-dependent decreases in blood pressure and body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall, MK-0916 was generally well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MK-0916 produced mechanism-based activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, resulting in mean increases in adrenal <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> levels that remained within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> doses tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of HSD1 with MK-0916 was generally well tolerated in patients with T2DM and MetS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although no significant improvement in FPG was observed with MK-0916 compared to placebo, modest improvements in A1C, body weight and blood pressure were observed </plain></SENT>
