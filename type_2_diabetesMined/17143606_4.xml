<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied associations between the birthweight of parents and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> in the offspring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified men and women (aged 35-68 years), who had been born in Holdsworth Memorial Hospital, Mysore, India </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also identified the offspring (20-46 years) of these men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In total, 283 offspring of 193 mothers and 223 offspring of 144 fathers were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Investigations included anthropometry, oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, plasma insulin and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> concentrations and blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> was defined using WHO criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the offspring, lower birthweight was associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo>, impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) and higher cholesterol and triacylglycerol concentrations (p &lt; 0.05 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> adjusted for sex and age) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most outcomes in the offspring, including most individual components of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e>, were unrelated to parental birthweight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, both maternal and paternal birthweight were inversely related to offspring <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> (odds ratio [OR] 0.36 [95% CI: 0.13-1.01] per kg, p = 0.053 for mother-offspring pairs; OR 0.26 [0.07-0.93], p = 0.04 for father-offspring pairs, adjusted for offspring age, sex, BMI and socioeconomic status) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Maternal birthweight was inversely related to offspring systolic blood pressure (beta = -2.5 mmHg [-5.00 to 0.03] per kg maternal birthweight; p = 0.052) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Factors in both parents may influence the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> in their offspring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There are several possible explanations, but the findings are consistent with the fetal insulin (genetic) hypothesis </plain></SENT>
