<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of topically applied recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor-BB (rhPDGF-BB) (becaplermin) with placebo gel in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> diabetic neuropathic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> of the lower extremities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This multicenter double-blind placebo-controlled phase III trial included 382 patients with type 1 or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> of at least 8 weeks' duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After sharp debridement of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath>, patients were randomized to receive becaplermin gel 30 micrograms/g, becaplermin gel 100 micrograms/g, or placebo gel, in conjunction with a standardized regimen of good wound care until complete wound closure was achieved or for a maximum of 20 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moist saline-soaked gauze dressings were changed twice daily with study medication applied by patients or caregivers at the evening dressing change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Safety was assessed by monitoring adverse events (AEs) and by clinical laboratory evaluations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with placebo gel, becaplermin gel 100 micrograms/g significantly increased the incidence of complete wound closure by 43% (50 vs. 35%, P = 0.007) and decreased the time to achieve complete wound closure by 32% (86 vs. 127 days; estimated 35th percentile, P = 0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AEs reported during treatment or during a 3-month follow-up period were similar in nature and incidence across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Becaplermin gel 100 micrograms/g, in conjunction with good wound care, significantly increased the incidence of complete wound closure and significantly reduced the time to complete closure of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> diabetic neuropathic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The safety profile of becaplermin gel was similar to that of placebo gel </plain></SENT>
