<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied prospectively 2610 patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> attending our <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects were compared according to degree of sensory loss, and presence or absence of neuropathic pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effects of gender and ethnicity were evaluated by studying patients in different height bands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Insensate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> and painful <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> was present in 11.4 and 3.3% of subjects, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Age, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, height, vibration perception and HbA(1c) (P&lt;0.0001) were independent determinants of insensate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e>, whereas only duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and vibration perception (P&lt;0.0001) were predictive of pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was more insensate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> in males (OR 1.9) and anglo-celtics (OR 1.4) but stratification by height showed that these effects were due to height </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Height has no influence on the development of pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is significant overlap but also considerable dichotomy in the two major forms of diabetic sensory <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The insensate type is more explainable by duration, degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> and length of peripheral nerves, factors that are likely to reflect severity of underlying structural nerve damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Glycaemic control was not a predictor of painful <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
