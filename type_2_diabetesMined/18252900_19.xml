<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether and to what extent risk factors for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and other baseline characteristics of the study participants modified the effectiveness of the lifestyle intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Overweight, middle-aged volunteers with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> were randomly assigned to intensive lifestyle intervention (n = 265) or to a control group (n = 257) for a median of 4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> status was ascertained annually with repeated oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Incidence rates of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and hazard ratios (HRs) comparing the intervention group with the control group were calculated by sex and baseline tertiles of age, BMI, waist circumference, plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration at fasting and 2 h after a <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> load, fasting serum insulin and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> index, and categories of composite baseline Finnish <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Risk Score (FINDRISC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interactions between the intervention assignment and baseline risk factors on <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The intervention was most effective among the oldest individuals (HRs 0.77, 0.49, and 0.36 by increasing age tertiles, respectively; P(interaction) = 0.0130) and those with a high baseline FINDRISC (HRs 1.09, 0.84, 0.34, and 0.22 by increasing risk score category, respectively; P(interaction) = 0.0400) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The effect of the intervention on <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk was not modified by other baseline characteristics or risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The FINDRISC may be useful in identifying high-risk groups most likely to benefit from intensive lifestyle intervention to prevent type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
