<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Accumulation of visceral adipose tissue is also associated with iron metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite the coincidence of visfatin expression in iron-rich tissues, no study has investigated the possible interaction of visfatin with parameters of iron metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We evaluated insulin sensitivity and parameters of iron metabolism in 95 men with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (NGT) and 43 men with altered <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Men with newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had significantly increased serum visfatin in parallel with increased serum prohepcidin and serum ferritin compared with the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects as a whole, circulating visfatin was not found to be significantly linked to insulin sensitivity (r = 0.07, P = 0.4) but was significantly associated with serum prohepcidin concentration (r = 0.40, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> status and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance status influenced the relationships among visfatin, insulin sensitivity, and parameters of iron metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among men with altered <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, serum visfatin was strongly associated with serum prohepcidin (r = 0.61, P &lt; 0.0001) and serum soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) (r = -0.51, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In nonobese subjects, sTfR (P = 0.02) and prohepcidin (P = 0.04) contributed independently to visfatin variance after controlling for age and BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When insulin sensitivity was added to the model, only the latter (P = 0.006) contributed to 17% of visfatin variance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> men, however, only sTfR (P = 0.04) contributed independently to visfatin variance in this latter model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Serum visfatin concentration is significantly associated with parameters of iron metabolism, especially in subjects with altered <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
