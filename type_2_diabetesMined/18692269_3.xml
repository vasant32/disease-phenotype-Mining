<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study compared the risk of exercise-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients receiving either basal insulin glargine or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a prospective trial, 122 ICT patients (glargine n=60, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> n=62) had a standardized treadmill test, monitored by capillary <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (BG) profiles were performed the day before, during and the day after the exercise test, with the patients on a strict carbohydrate-defined diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had been on a stable ICT scheme for at least three months and had an HbA1c below 7.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BG at the beginning of the exercise test, BG decline and lowest BG during the test were comparable between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The episodes of mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> (BG&lt;3.3 mmol/l) and amounts of additional carbohydrate intake due to mild symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> (BG 3.3-5.0 mmol/l) were not significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No episodes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> occurred during several hours after the exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Moderate physical activity can be recommended for well-controlled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients receiving ICT, independently of glargine or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> as basal insulin and without risk of exercise-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
