<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Self-monitoring of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (SMBG) is a cornerstone of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care, but little is known about barriers to this self-care practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study examines SMBG practice patterns and barriers in 44,181 adults with pharmacologically treated <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Region who responded to a health survey (83% response rate) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome is self-reported frequency of SMBG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although most patients reported some level of SMBG monitoring, 60% of those with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 67% of those with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> reported practicing SMBG less frequently than recommended by the American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association (three to four times daily for type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and once daily for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treated pharmacologically) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant independent predictors of nonadherent practice of SMBG included longer time since diagnosis, less intensive therapy, male sex, age, belonging to an ethnic minority, having a lower education and neighborhood income, difficulty communicating in English, higher out-of-pocket costs for glucometer strips (especially for subjects with lower incomes), smoking, and excessive alcohol consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Considerable gaps persist between actual and recommended SMBG practices in this large managed care organization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A somewhat reduced SMBG frequency in subjects with linguistic barriers, some ethnic minorities, and subjects with lower education levels suggests the potential for targeted, culturally sensitive, multilingual health education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The somewhat lower frequency of SMBG among subjects paying higher out-of-pocket expenditures for strips suggests that removal of financial barriers by providing more comprehensive coverage for these costs may enhance adherence to recommendations for SMBG </plain></SENT>
