<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We investigated in general practice the efficacy of antiplatelets and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> in primary prevention of cardiovascular events in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The Primary Prevention Project (PPP) is a randomized, open trial with a two-by-two factorial design aimed to investigate low-dose aspirin (100 mg/day) and vitamin E (300 mg/day) in the prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with one or more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was a composite end point of cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 1,031 people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the PPP, aged &gt;/=50 years, without a previous cardiovascular event were enrolled by 316 general practitioners and 14 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> outpatient clinics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The PPP trial was prematurely stopped (after a median of 3.7 years) by the independent data safety and monitoring board because of a consistent benefit of aspirin compared with the control group in a population of 4,495 patients with one or more major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In diabetic patients, aspirin treatment was associated with a nonsignificant reduction in the main end point (relative risk [RR] = 0.90, 95% CI 0.50-1.62) and in total cardiovascular events (0.89, 0.62-1.26) and with a nonsignificant increase in cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (1.23, 0.69-2.19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In nondiabetic subjects, RRs for the main end point, total cardiovascular events, and cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were 0.59 (0.37-0.94), 0.69 (0.53-0.90), and 0.32 (0.14-0.72), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant reduction in any of the end points considered could be found with vitamin E in either diabetic or nondiabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest a lower effect of primary prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) with low-dose aspirin in diabetic patients as opposed to subjects with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>If confirmed, these findings might indicate that the antiplatelet effects of aspirin in diabetic patients are overwhelmed by aspirin-insensitive mechanisms of platelet activation and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation, thus making the balance between benefits and harms of aspirin treatment unfavorable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further large-scale trials investigating the role of aspirin in the primary prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> in diabetic patients are urgently needed </plain></SENT>
