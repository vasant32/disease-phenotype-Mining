<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Linkage of the chromosome 1q21-25 region to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> has been demonstrated in multiple ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed common variant fine-mapping across a 23-Mb interval in a multiethnic sample to search for variants responsible for this linkage signal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 5,290 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were successfully genotyped in 3,179 type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> case and control subjects from eight populations with evidence of 1q linkage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Samples were ascertained using strategies designed to enhance power to detect variants causal for 1q linkage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After imputation, we estimate approximately 80% coverage of common variation across the region (r (2) &gt; 0.8, Europeans) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Association signals of interest were evaluated through in silico replication and de novo genotyping in approximately 8,500 case subjects and 12,400 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Association mapping of the 23-Mb region identified two strong signals, both of which were restricted to the subset of European-descent samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The first mapped to the NOS1AP (CAPON) gene region (lead SNP: rs7538490, odds ratio 1.38 [95% CI 1.21-1.57], P = 1.4 x 10(-6), in 999 case subjects and 1,190 control subjects); the second mapped within an extensive region of linkage disequilibrium that includes the ASH1L and PKLR genes (lead SNP: rs11264371, odds ratio 1.48 [1.18-1.76], P = 1.0 x 10(-5), under a dominant model) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, there was no evidence for association at either signal on replication, and, across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> data (&gt;24,000 subjects), there was no indication that these variants were causally related to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Detailed fine-mapping of the 23-Mb region of replicated linkage has failed to identify common variant signals contributing to the observed signal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Future studies should focus on identification of causal alleles of lower frequency and higher penetrance </plain></SENT>
