<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Individually, these genes increase the disease risk only minimally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The goals of the present study were to determine, at the population level, the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in individuals who carry risk alleles within several susceptibility genes for the disease and the added value of this genetic information over the clinical predictors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We constructed an additive genetic score using the most replicated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within 15 type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-susceptibility genes, weighting each SNP with its reported effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We tested this score in the extensively phenotyped population-based cross-sectional CoLaus Study in Lausanne, Switzerland (n = 5,360), involving 356 diabetic individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The clinical predictors of prevalent <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were age, BMI, family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, WHR, and triacylglycerol/<z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for these variables, the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 2.7 (95% CI 1.8-4.0, p = 0.000006) for individuals with a genetic score within the top quintile, compared with the bottom quintile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adding the genetic score to the clinical covariates improved the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve slightly (from 0.86 to 0.87), yet significantly (p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>BMI was similar in these two extreme quintiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In this population, a simple weighted 15 SNP-based genetic score provides additional information over clinical predictors of prevalent <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At this stage, however, the clinical benefit of this genetic information is limited </plain></SENT>
