<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We screened for mutations in the gene of insulin-sensitive phosphodiesterase 3B (PDE3B), which regulates antilipolytic actions of insulin via reduction of intracellular cyclic <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi> levels, in Japanese patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and lipoatrophic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> using single-stranded conformation polymorphism analysis and Southern analysis and investigated frequencies of variable number of tandem repeats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A silent polymorphism at the Arg463 codon (AGG--&gt;AGA) in exon 4 was identified after examining <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 16 exons and exon-intron splicing junctions of the gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This polymorphism was found in 53 of 100 subjects with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, 2 of 5 lipoatrophic diabetic patients and 24 of 50 control subjects, without any significant difference in allele frequency between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An EcoRI restriction fragment length polymorphism was identified in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and control subjects, again with no differences in occurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The allelic distribution of two polymorphic tandem repeats sequences in introns 5 and 12 of the gene did not differ significantly between patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, alterations in the PDE3B gene are unlikely to contribute importantly to the pathogenesis of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> or lipoatrophic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> in Japan </plain></SENT>
