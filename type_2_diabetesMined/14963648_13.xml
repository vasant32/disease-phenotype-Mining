<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analysed data from 1269 patients with Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> from a community-based observational study of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care, control and complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Silent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> was defined as Q waves (Minnesota codes 1.1, 1.2) on a baseline electrocardiogram in the absence of a history or symptoms of CHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Silent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> was present in 3.9% of patients, or 44% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Q-wave <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarctions</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were subdivided into those with (i). no clinical or Q-wave evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (Group 1), (ii). silent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (Group 2), (iii) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>self-reported CHD but no Q waves (Group 3), and (iv) self-reported CHD and Q waves (Group 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared to Groups 3 and 4, Group 2 patients were more likely to be women, less likely to have smoked, and had higher serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> concentrations and higher blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Over an average of seven years, and after adjusting for other independent predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause and CHD mortality were similar in Groups 1 and 2 and greater (twofold for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause and fourfold for CHD mortality) in Groups 3 and 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Silent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> is common in Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and has a prognosis similar to that in patients without a history of CHD or Q waves </plain></SENT>
