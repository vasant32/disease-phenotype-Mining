<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>Steatosis</z:hpo> associates with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and may even predict type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and cardiovascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because muscular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> relates to myocellular fat deposition and disturbed energy metabolism, we hypothesized that reduced hepatic ATP turnover (fATP) underlies <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and elevated hepatocellular <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> (HCL) contents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We measured hepatic fATP using (31)P magnetic resonance spectroscopy in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and age- and body mass-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Peripheral (M and M/I) and hepatic (suppression of endogenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production) insulin sensitivity were assessed with euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Diabetic individuals had 29% and 28% lower peripheral and hepatic insulin sensitivity as well as 42% reduced fATP than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for HCL, fATP correlated positively with peripheral and hepatic insulin sensitivity but negatively with waist circumference, BMI, and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multiple regression analysis identified waist circumference as an independent predictor of fATP and inorganic phosphate (P(I)) concentrations, explaining 65% (P = 0.001) and 56% (P = 0.003) of the variations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hepatocellular P(I) primarily determined the alterations in fATP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> relates to perturbed hepatic energy metabolism, which is at least partly accounted for by fat depots </plain></SENT>
