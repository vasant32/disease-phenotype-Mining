<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Six-week-old <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) and MKR mice were fed with or without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> for 3 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blood was collected from the tail vein for serum biochemistry analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp analysis was performed to study effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> on insulin sensitivity of tissues in MKR mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Northern blot analysis was performed to measure levels of target genes of PPAR gamma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> in white adipose tissue and hepatic gluconeogenic genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thiazolidinedione treatment of MKR mice significantly lowered serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels and increased serum adiponectin levels but did not affect levels of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and serum insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp showed that whole-body insulin sensitivity and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis failed to improve in MKR mice after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Insulin suppression of hepatic endogenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production failed to improve in MKR mice following <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This lack of change in hepatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0008189'>insulin insensitivity</z:hpo> was associated with no change in the ratio of HMW : total adiponectin, hepatic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> content, and sustained hepatic expression of PPAR gamma and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15541">stearoyl-CoA</z:chebi> desaturase 1 mRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> markedly enhanced <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake by white adipose tissue with a parallel increase in CD36, aP2 and GLUT4 gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These data suggest that potentiation of insulin action on tissues other than adipose tissue is required to mediate the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> in our MKR diabetic mice </plain></SENT>
