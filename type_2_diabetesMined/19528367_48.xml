<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether dapagliflozin, which selectively inhibits renal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> reabsorption, lowers <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> that is poorly controlled with high insulin doses plus oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> agents (OADs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind, three-arm parallel-group, placebo-controlled, 26-center trial (U.S. and Canada) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on data from an insulin dose-adjustment setting cohort (n = 4), patients in the treatment cohort (n = 71) were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to placebo, 10 mg dapagliflozin, or 20 mg dapagliflozin, plus OAD(s) and 50% of their daily insulin dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was change from baseline in A1C at week 12 (dapagliflozin vs. placebo, last observation carried forward [LOCF]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At week 12 (LOCF), the 10- and 20-mg dapagliflozin groups demonstrated -0.70 and -0.78% mean differences in A1C change from baseline versus placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In both dapagliflozin groups, 65.2% of patients achieved a decrease from baseline in A1C &gt; or =0.5% versus 15.8% in the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean changes from baseline in fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) were +17.8, +2.4, and -9.6 mg/dl (placebo, 10 mg dapagliflozin, and 20 mg dapagliflozin, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi>) reductions with dapagliflozin also showed dose dependence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean changes in total body weight were -1.9, -4.5, and -4.3 kg (placebo, 10 mg dapagliflozin, and 20 mg dapagliflozin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall, adverse events were balanced across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups, although more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0729552" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genital infections</z:e> occurred in the 20-mg dapagliflozin group than in the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients receiving high insulin doses plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">insulin sensitizers</z:chebi> who had their baseline insulin reduced by 50%, dapagliflozin decreased A1C, produced better FPG and <z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi> levels, and lowered weight more than placebo </plain></SENT>
