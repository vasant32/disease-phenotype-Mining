<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the adequacy of perioperative glycemic control in diabetic patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and to explore the association between glycemic control and in-hospital morbidity/mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> undergoing CABG between April 2000 and March 2001 who survived at least 24 h postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 291 patients in this study, 95% had type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 40% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During hospitalization (median 7 days), 78 (27%) of these patients suffered a nonfatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, septic complication, or died ("adverse outcomes") </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Glycemic control was suboptimal (average <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> on first postoperative day was 11.4 [11.2-11.6] mmol/l) and was significantly associated with adverse outcomes post-CABG (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients whose average <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level was in the highest quartile on postoperative day 1 had higher risk of adverse outcomes after the first postoperative day than those with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in the lowest quartile (odds ratio 2.5 [1.1-5.3]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Even after adjustment for other clinical and operative factors, average blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level on the first postoperative day remained significantly associated with subsequent adverse outcomes: for each 1-mmol/l increase above 6.1 mmol/l, risk increased by 17% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative glycemic control in our cohort of diabetic patients undergoing CABG in a tertiary care facility was suboptimal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We believe closure of this care gap is imperative, because <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> in the first postoperative day was associated with subsequent adverse outcomes in our study patients </plain></SENT>
