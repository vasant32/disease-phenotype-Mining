<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Age-related major medical, physiological, social and emotional problems make the clinical management of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in children and adolescents a difficult task for the physician and the family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Overall glycaemic control remains moderate or poor despite a treatment schedule, which interferes with several elements of "<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>" childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There is an up to tenfold geographical variation in the incidence of childhood Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> within Europe with relatively stable incidence rates in some countries (mainly northern), but dynamic increases in incidence in other countries (mainly central European).A number of nongenetic (environmental) factors have been associated with the risk of Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among these, perinatal factors, early nutrition, growth and vaccinations, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0857523" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">atopic diseases</z:e> and <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> are discussed in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The important interplay between genes, organism and environment is illustrated with new genetic data supporting the importance of environmental pressures in the evolution of this major disease.Although Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> usually accounts for only a minority of the total impact of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a population, it is the predominant form of the disease in younger age-groups in most developed countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is estimated that on an annual basis almost 100 000 children younger than 15 years of age develop Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> worldwide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic beta cells in Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> leads to absolute insulin dependence and a high rate of complications typically occurring at a relatively young age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> places a particularly heavy burden on the individual, the family and health services </plain></SENT>
