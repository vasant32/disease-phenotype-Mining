<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine whether urinary l-FABP levels are altered at various stages of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> and whether pitavastatin affects urinary l-FABP levels in early diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Fifty-eight patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (34 men and 24 women, median age 52 years) and 20 healthy, age-matched subjects (group E) were recruited for the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diabetic patients included 12 patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> (group A), 20 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> (group B), 14 patients with macroalbuminuria and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> renal function (group C), and 12 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>chronic renal failure</z:hpo> but not undergoing hemodialysis (blood <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> &gt;1.2 mg/dl; mean 2.5 mg/dl, group D) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty group B patients were randomly assigned to receive 1 mg/day pitavastatin (10 patients, group B1) or placebo (10 patients, group B2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment was continued for 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Urinary l-FABP levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Urinary 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine and serum free fatty acids (FFAs) were also measured in group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Urinary l-FABP levels in groups A-D were 6.2 +/- 4.6 microg/g <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, 19.6 +/- 13.5 microg/g <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, 26.8 +/- 20.4 microg/g <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, and 52.4 +/- 46.8 microg/g <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Urinary l-FABP levels in groups B-D were significantly higher than those in healthy subjects (group E, 5.8 +/- 4.0 microg/g <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>) (group B, P &lt; 0.05; group C, P &lt; 0.01; group D, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In group B1, urinary albumin excretion (UAE) and urinary l-FABP levels were decreased after pitavastatin treatment (UAE before, 110 +/- 74 microg/min; 6 months, 88 +/- 60 microg/min, P &lt; 0.05; 12 months, 58 +/- 32 microg/min, P &lt; 0.01; l-FABP before, 18.6 +/- 12.5 microg/g <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>; 6 months, 12.2 +/- 8.8 microg/g <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, P &lt; 0.05; 12 months, 8.8 +/- 6.4 microg/g <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In group B2, UAE and l-FABP levels showed little change during the experimental period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In group B1, urinary 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine was decreased 12 months after pitavastatin treatment (before 32.5 +/- 19.5 ng/mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, after 18.8 +/- 14.5 ng/mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, P &lt; 0.01), but in group B2, these showed little difference during the experimental period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In both groups B1 and B2, serum FFAs showed little difference during the experimental period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Urinary l-FABP levels appear to be associated with the progression of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, and pitavastatin may be effective in ameliorating tubulointerstitial damage in early diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
