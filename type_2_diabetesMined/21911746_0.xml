<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of genetic susceptibility on evolution toward type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2D) by analyzing time trajectories of fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA(1c)), insulin sensitivity (homeostasis model assessment [HOMA2%S]), and β-cell secretion (HOMA2%B) in a large nondiabetic cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We also examined whether baseline HbA(1c) modified the effect of genetic predisposition on the time trajectories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Time trajectories were drawn in 4,744 participants from the French Data from an Epidemiological Study on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin Resistance</z:hpo> Syndrome (D.E.S.I.R.) cohort based on samples collected every 3 years over a 9-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Trajectories were analyzed according to the TCF7L2 common variant, a family history of T2D, and a combination of at-risk alleles from nine T2D-associated genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a marked decrease in HOMA2%B in parallel to a steep increase in HbA(1c) over the 3 years before incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, which was not influenced by genetic predisposition when considered alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of T2D, the TCF7L2 at-risk variant was associated with a greater decrease in HOMA2%B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a joint effect of a family history of T2D with the presence of the TCF7L2 risk allele with a greater rise in HbA(1c) conferred by the coexistence of a family history and the T risk allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An HbA(1c) ≥5.7% at baseline was associated with a greater increase in both glycemia and HbA(1c) levels in the presence of a combination of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at-risk alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: After incident T2D, TCF7L2 at-risk variants were associated with a faster decrease in β-cell function compared with those with the CC genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a joint effect of family history of T2D and TCF7L2 risk variant on the rise in glycemia and the decrease in insulin secretion at the end of follow-up, suggesting the joint influence of the combination of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> genetic predisposition with familial factors on the evolution of glycemia over time </plain></SENT>
