<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 109,983 women aged 34-59 years in 1980 were followed through 2002 for the occurrence of hip fracture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At baseline and through biennial follow-up, women were asked about their history and treatment of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and other potential risk factors for hip fracture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During 2.22 million person-years of follow-up, 1,398 women had a hip fracture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with women without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the age-adjusted relative risk (RRs) of hip fracture was 7.1 (95% CI 4.4-11.4) for women with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 1.7 (1.4-2.0) for those with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After further adjustment for BMI, smoking, physical activity, menopausal status, daily intake of calcium, <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi>, protein, and postmenopausal hormone use, the multivariate RR of incident hip fracture in individuals with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with individuals without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 6.4 (3.9-10.3) and with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 2.2 (1.8-2.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The RRs increased with longer duration of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (3.1 [2.3-4.0] for &gt;or=12 years compared with no <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, P for trend &lt; 0.001) and ever use of insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that both type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are associated with an increased risk of hip fracture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results of this study highlight the need for fracture-prevention strategies in women with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
