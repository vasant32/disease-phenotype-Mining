<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study describes changes in HbA1c, weight and body mass index (BMI) over 24 months postinsulin initiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: First-time insulin users with T2DM were selected from the UK General Practice Research Database for the period 1st January 2002 to 31st March 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cohort was stratified into BMI categories (kg/m(2) ) at the time of insulin initiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data were reviewed at 6-monthly intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A multivariate repeated-measures linear model was fitted assessing weight change over 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 3783 patients were included (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> weight, n = 672; overweight, n = 1259; <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, n = 1070; clinically <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, n = 480; morbidly <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, n = 302) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The largest reductions in HbA1c were observed 6 months postinsulin initiation and were greatest in lower BMI categories: median observed HbA1c at initiation and 6 months was 9.7 and 7.9% in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> weight patients and 9.6 and 8.2% in the clinically <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A minority of patients achieved HbA1c ≤ 7.5% and by 24 months the proportion achieving this was: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> weight 41%; overweight 34%; <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> 30%; clinically <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> 26%; morbidly <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> 31%; trend p &lt; 0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The greatest <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> occured by 6 months and multivariate adjusted models showed that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> weight patients had the highest gains 5.07 kg (95% CI: 3.35, 6.79), as did those with HbA1c ≥ 12.1%-5.55 kg (95% CI: 3.81, 7.28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> is associated with a poorer response to insulin illustrated by higher HbA1c values and lower achievement of targets </plain></SENT>
