<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study was a double-blind, randomized, multicenter and parallel-group, dose-range finding study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We enrolled 145 patients (91 men and 54 women) with a median age of 53 years and a median body mass index of 25.1 kg/m(2)  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median baseline fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) was 8.1 mmol/l, the median HbA1c was 7.9% and the median time since the diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 2 weeks of an exercise/diet programme followed by 2 weeks of a placebo period, the subjects were randomized to one of the four following groups for a 12-week active treatment period: placebo and 50, 100 or 200 mg of LC15-0444 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three doses of LC15-0444 significantly reduced the HbA1c from baseline compared to the placebo group (-0.06 vs. -0.98, -0.74 and -0.78% in the placebo and 50, 100 and 200 mg groups, respectively), without a significant difference between the doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subjects with a higher baseline HbA1c (≥8.5%) had a greater reduction in HbA1c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Insulin secretory function, as assessed using homeostasis model assessment-beta cell, C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> and the insulinogenic index, improved significantly with LC15-0444 treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity, as assessed using homeostasis model assessment-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, also improved significantly after 12 weeks of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 50 and 200 mg groups had significantly reduced total cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> levels at 12 weeks compared to the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No dosage of LC15-0444 affected weight or waist circumference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The incidences of adverse events were similar in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> study subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LC15-0444 monotherapy (50 mg for 12 weeks) improved the HbA1c, FPG level, oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test results, β-cell function and insulin sensitivity measures, and was well tolerated in Korean subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
