<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals, postprandial insulin peaks are not accompanied by corresponding changes in circulating leptin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Postprandial regulation of leptin in individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, to our knowledge, has not been previously examined in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined the effect of meals on circulating leptin levels in six patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were not treated with insulin and in seven <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After informed consent was obtained, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects were admitted to the General Clinical Research Center for 6 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They consumed four meals daily (breakfast, lunch, dinner and snack) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eighteen blood samples were drawn between 7.40 a.m. and midnight for the determination of serum leptin, insulin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Postprandial peaks were clearly identifiable for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin levels both in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects and in those with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, no postprandial peaks of leptin levels were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Correlation analysis demonstrated a lack of correlation between leptin levels and the levels of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> or insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that, in spite of the presence of postprandial insulin peaks, there are no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> changes in circulating leptin levels postprandially in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who are not on insulin therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In this regard, in-vivo regulation of leptin by meals in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is similar to that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals </plain></SENT>
