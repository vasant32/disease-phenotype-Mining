<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Finnish national healthcare registers were used to identify individuals with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosed between 1992 and 1996 at 15-39 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Non-diabetic control participants were chosen from the National Population Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anthropometric measurements were obtained from the original child welfare clinic records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only the case-control pairs with sufficient growth data recorded were included in the analyses (218/1,388 for type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> [16%] and 64/1,121 for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> [6%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two developmental stages in BMI growth (the points of infancy maximum BMI and the BMI rebound) were examined, and conditional logistic regression was applied to the variables of interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The risk for type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> increased 1.19-fold per 1 kg/m(2) rise in the infancy maximum BMI (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, there was a 1.77-fold increase in the risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> per 1 kg/m(2) rise in the level of BMI at the BMI rebound (p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Higher values of BMI at these points corresponded to a larger BMI gain from birth to that developmental stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Age at the infancy maximum BMI or age at the BMI rebound did not affect the risk for either type of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The BMI gain in infancy among individuals who subsequently developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011462'>young adult-onset</z:hpo> type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was faster than that of those who remained healthy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The excess BMI gain in individuals who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011462'>young adult-onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> could already be seen during early childhood </plain></SENT>
