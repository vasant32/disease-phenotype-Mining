<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this multicenter, double-blind study, patients were randomized to receive either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> 15 mg (n = 319) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> 850 mg (n = 320) and up to 45 mg/day and 2,550 mg/day, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary efficacy endpoint was HbA(1c) at week 52 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profiles were also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HbA(1c) was reduced by 1.20% in the SU plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> group and 1.36% in the SU plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> group, and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was reduced by 2.2 and 2.3 mmol/l in the respective groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fasting insulin levels were also reduced (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> arm -1.3 micro IU/ml; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> arm -0.8 micro IU/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no significant between-treatment differences in these three parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">Pioglitazone</z:chebi> addition to SU significantly reduced <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (-16 vs. -9%; P = 0.008) and increased <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (14 vs. 8%; P &lt; 0.001) compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> addition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> was increased 2% by the addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> and decreased 5% by the addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> to SU (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Urinary albumin-to-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio was reduced by 15% in the SU plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> group and increased 2% in the SU plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> group (P = 0.017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both combinations were well tolerated with no evidence of hepatic or cardiac toxicity in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Clinically equivalent improvements in glycemic control were observed for both combinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> plus SU, addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> to SU resulted in a reduction of the urinary albumin-to-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio, a small but significant rise in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, and significantly greater improvements in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> plus SU was associated with a significant reduction in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>SU plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> is an effective and well-tolerated combination regimen that may provide additional beneficial effects for patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
