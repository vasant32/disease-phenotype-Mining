<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pancreatic beta-cell IL-1 expression is increased and interleukin-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> (IL-1Ra) expression reduced in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment with recombinant IL-1Ra improves glycemia and beta-cell function and reduces inflammatory markers in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we investigated the durability of these responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Among 70 ambulatory patients who had type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, A1C &gt;7.5%, and BMI &gt;27 kg/m(2) and were randomly assigned to receive 13 weeks of anakinra, a recombinant human IL-1Ra, or placebo, 67 completed treatment and were included in this double-blind 39-week follow-up study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Primary outcome was change in beta-cell function after anakinra withdrawal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis was done by intention to treat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-nine weeks after anakinra withdrawal, the proinsulin-to-insulin (PI/I) ratio but not stimulated C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> remained improved (by -0.07 [95% CI -0.14 to -0.02], P = 0.011) compared with values in placebo-treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, a subgroup characterized by genetically determined low baseline IL-1Ra serum levels maintained the improved stimulated C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> obtained by 13 weeks of IL-1Ra treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reductions in C-reactive protein (-3.2 mg/l [-6.2 to -1.1], P = 0.014) and in IL-6 (-1.4 ng/l [-2.6 to -0.3], P = 0.036) were maintained until the end of study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: IL-1 blockade with anakinra induces improvement of the PI/I ratio and markers of systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> lasting 39 weeks after treatment withdrawal </plain></SENT>
