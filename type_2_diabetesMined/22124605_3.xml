<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifteen individuals with IGT, 15 type 2 diabetic patients treated with exogenous insulin (INS), and 15 type 2 diabetic patients treated with oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering medication (OGLM) participated in a randomised crossover experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants were studied on three occasions for 3 days under strict dietary standardisation, but otherwise free-living conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis was assessed by ambulatory continuous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring over the 24 h period following a 45 min session of resistance-type exercise (75% one repetition maximum), endurance-type exercise (50% maximum workload capacity) or no exercise at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Average 24 h blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations were reduced from 7.4 ± 0.2, 9.6 ± 0.5 and 9.2 ± 0.7 mmol/l during the control experiment to 6.9 ± 0.2, 8.6 ± 0.4 and 8.1 ± 0.5 mmol/l (resistance-type exercise) and 6.8 ± 0.2, 8.6 ± 0.5 and 8.5 ± 0.5 mmol/l (endurance-type exercise) over the 24 h period following a single bout of exercise in the IGT, OGLM and INS groups, respectively (p &lt; 0.001 for both treatments) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: A single session of resistance- or endurance-type exercise substantially reduces the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> during the subsequent 24 h period in individuals with IGT, and in insulin-treated and non-insulin-treated type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
