<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effect of a single subcutaneous injection is brief because of rapid degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore sought to evaluate the effect of infusion of GLP-1 for 48 h in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We infused GLP-1 (2.4 pmol.kg-1.min-1) or saline subcutaneously for 48 h in randomized order in six patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> to evaluate the effect on appetite during fixed energy intake and on plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, glucagon, postprandial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020473" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lipidemia</z:e>, blood pressure, heart rate, and basal metabolic rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The infusion resulted in elevations of the plasma concentrations of intact GLP-1 similar to those observed after intravenous infusion of 1.2 pmol.kg-1.min-1, previously shown to lower blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> effectively in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (day 2) decreased from 14.1 +/- 0.9 (saline) to 12.2 +/- 0.7 mmol/l (GLP-1), P = 0.009, and 24-h mean plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> decreased from 15.4 +/- 1.0 to 13.0 +/- 1.0 mmol/l, P = 0.0009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fasting and total area under the curve for insulin and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels were significantly higher during the GLP-1 administration, whereas glucagon levels were unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neither <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> nor free fatty acids were affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>GLP-1 administration decreased hunger and prospective food intake and increased satiety, whereas fullness was unaffected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No side effects during GLP-1 infusion were recorded except for a brief cutaneous reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Basal metabolic rate and heart rate did not change significantly during GLP-1 administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure tended to be lower during the GLP-1 infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that 48-h continuous subcutaneous infusion of GLP-1 in type 2 diabetic patients 1) lowers fasting as well as meal-related plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, 2) reduces appetite, 3) has no gastrointestinal side effects, and 4) has no negative effect on blood pressure </plain></SENT>
