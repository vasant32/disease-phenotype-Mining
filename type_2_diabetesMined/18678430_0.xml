<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> had (i) neither history/symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> (CHD) nor pathological Q waves at FDS recruitment between 1993 and 1996, (ii) five consecutive annual assessments by FDS close-out in 2001, and (iii) contrast-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging in 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At this latter assessment, there were (i) 9 with no history of CHD or Q waves during follow-up (Group 1), (ii) 13 with Q waves on &gt;/=1 electrocardiogram but no CHD history/symptoms (Group 2), and (iii) 14 with CHD history/symptoms irrespective of electrocardiographic status (Group 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 20 episodes of new Q waves in 17 Group 2 or Group 3 patients during FDS follow-up, 17 (85%) resolved within 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) was detected by CMR in three patients (8.3%; one subendocardial in Groups 1 and 3, one non-full-thickness in Group 3) but these did not correlate with electrocardiographic appearances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Q waves may have unreliable pathological significance in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, including as a marker of silent MI </plain></SENT>
