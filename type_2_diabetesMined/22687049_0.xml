<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined insulin secretion, iNOS expression and its relationship to the cAMP system in islets from human type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Insulin, glucagon and cAMP were analysed by RIA; iNOS or phosphodiesterase (PDE) expression by quantitative PCR (qPCR), Western blot and confocal microscopy; cell viability by MTS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Diabetic islets displayed impaired insulin and glucagon responses to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, disturbed cAMP generation and high inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (iNOS) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Confocal microscopy showed iNOS protein expression in diabetic islets being confined to insulin, glucagon and somatostatin cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Culture of diabetic islets at 5.5 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50095">dibutyryl-cAMP</z:chebi> (Bt(2) -cAMP) for 24 h was accompanied by marked suppression of iNOS <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, reduced <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> production and <z:mp ids='MP_0003058'>increased insulin secretion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Diabetic islets displayed marked increase in PDE3A and PDE3B <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Short-time incubation of diabetic islets showed, among the PDE inhibitors tested, cilostazol being most favourable to increase insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Diabetic islets were most susceptible to long-term (72 h) culture at high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (20 mmol/l) reacting with <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Bt(2) -cAMP and the PDE inhibitors cilostazol, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50693">milrinone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34795,48518">IBMX</z:chebi> efficiently increased cell viability at high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> during culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Defective <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin release upon induction of iNOS was restored by iNOS inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40618">aminoguanidine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that in islets from type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, stimulatory effects in certain cAMP-compartments induced by PDE inhibitors might play a central role in the suppression of iNOS, resulting in increased β-cell viability and improved secretory response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
