<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the early stages of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0003676'>progressive disorder</z:hpo>, glycaemic control can be established through diet and exercise alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Indeed, in some patients, marked weight reduction can lead to normalized fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As a consequence, pharmacological approaches to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> have been investigated as a new option for the management of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi>- and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi>-reuptake inhibitor sibutramine has emerged as the most promising agent in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, although it appears to be less effective in diabetic patients than in non-diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other weight-reducing agents of potential benefit include noradrenergic anorexiants, orlistat, leptin, and beta3-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Insulin and insulin secretagogues, the oldest available <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs, have been used to compensate for beta-cell secretory defects in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Repaglinide, a new, fast-acting insulin secretagogue with a short duration of action, reduces postprandial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> when taken shortly before meals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Other novel <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> agents are currently under development, including pramlintide (an amylin analogue) and glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pramlintide slows gastric emptying and delays <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> absorption, and glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> is the most potent endogenous stimulator of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced insulin release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Recent advances in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> therapy have seen the development of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>), which improve <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in patients whose <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is poorly controlled by diet and exercise therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">Thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> bind to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) and act through a process involving gene regulation at a transcriptional level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">Troglitazone</z:chebi>, the first approved drug in the class, has been shown to decrease plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels as monotherapy but is more effective in combination with sulphonylureas, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, or insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, despite its generally good safety profile, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> has been associated with severe idiosyncratic hepatocellular injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There have been more than 150 spontaneous reports of serious hepatic events, including at least 25 instances in which patients died or required a liver transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">Rosiglitazone</z:chebi>, the most potent thiazolidinedione, is still in clinical development, as is <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>To date, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> has been shown to have no reported cases of idiosyncratic drug reactions leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001399'>liver failure</z:hpo> and no clinically significant drug interactions with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38559">cytochrome P450</z:chebi> 3A4-metabolized drugs such as <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">nifedipine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Although the available data for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> are limited to the results of short-term studies, it is reported to be safe and well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Combination therapy is increasingly important in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> management following failure of monotherapy because complementary mechanisms of action of the different classes of oral agents demonstrate synergistic effects when used in combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Oral agents may also be used as adjuncts to insulin for achieving glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
