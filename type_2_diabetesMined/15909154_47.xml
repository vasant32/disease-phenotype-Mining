<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this case-control study, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects diagnosed with a fracture (n=124,655) in Denmark served as cases, and for each case three control subjects (n=373,962) matched for sex and age were retrieved from the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were associated with an increased risk (1) of any fracture (odds ratio [OR]=1.3, 95% CI: 1.2-1.5 for type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 1.2, 95% CI: 1.1-1.3 for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after adjustment for confounders) and (2) of hip fractures (OR=1.7, 95% CI: 1.3-2.2 for type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and 1.4, 95% CI: 1.2-1.6 for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was associated with a significant increase in forearm fractures (OR=1.2, 95% CI: 1.0-1.5), and type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was associated with an increased risk of spine fractures (OR=2.5, 95% CI: 1.3-4.6), whereas type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and sulphonylureas was associated with a significantly decreased risk of any fracture, whereas a non-significant trend towards decreased risk of any fracture was associated with the use of insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Except for a decrease in hip fractures with use of sulphonylureas, no change in fracture risk in the hip, spine or forearm was associated with the use of insulin or oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are associated with an increased risk of any fracture and hip fractures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The use of drugs to control <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may reduce the association between <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and fractures </plain></SENT>
