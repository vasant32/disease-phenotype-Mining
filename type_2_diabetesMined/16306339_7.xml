<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mixed family history is associated with more type 1-like genetic (HLA and insulin gene) and phenotypic characteristics in type 2 diabetic patients, especially in the GAD antibody-positive subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Leaving out the extreme ends of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> phenotypes, young children progressing rapidly to total insulin deficiency and strongly insulin-resistant subjects mostly with non-Europid ethnic origin, a large proportion of diabetic patients may have both type 1 and type 2 processes contributing to their diabetic phenotype </plain></SENT>
