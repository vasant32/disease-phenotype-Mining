<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether the continuous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring system (CGMS; MiniMed, Sylmar, CA) is useful for investigating the incidence of unrecognized <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemias</z:hpo> in type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients and for improving metabolic control in type 1 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 70 diabetic subjects (40 type 1 and 30 type 2 subjects) were monitored using the CGMS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The number of unrecognized <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemias</z:hpo> was registered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the 40 type 1 diabetic patients whose treatment was modified in accordance with the information obtained from the CGMS were compared with a control group of 35 different type 1 diabetic patients using intensive capillary <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HbA(1c) levels were measured before the monitoring period and 3 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The CGMS detected unrecognized <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemias</z:hpo> in 62.5% of the type 1 diabetic patients and in 46.6% of the type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found that 73.7% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> events occurred at night </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HbA(1c) concentrations decreased significantly in both the group of type 1 diabetic subjects monitored with the CGMS (from 8.3 +/- 1.6 to 7.5 +/- 1.2%, P &lt; 0.01) and the control group (from 8.0 +/- 1.4 to 7.5 +/- 0.8%, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The greatest reduction was observed in the subgroup of patients who started continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion therapy, both in the CGMS-monitored and control groups (from 9.4 +/- 2 to 7.2 +/- 1.4% and from 8.1 +/- 1.8 to 7.1 +/- 0.6%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The CGMS is useful for detecting unrecognized <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemias</z:hpo> in type 1 and type 2 diabetic subjects; however, it is not better than standard capillary <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> measurements for improving metabolic control of type 1 diabetic subjects, regardless of the therapeutic regimen </plain></SENT>
