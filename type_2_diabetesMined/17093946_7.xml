<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate the mechanism involved, we examined the role of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB), the distal target of IKK, in hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To inhibit NF-kappaB activity, db/db mice were infected with adenovirus expressing the IkappaBalpha super-repressor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The IkappaBalpha super-repressor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001486" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adenovirus infection</z:e> caused a moderate reduction of NF-kappaB activity in liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The treatment was associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005292'>improved glucose tolerance</z:mp>, reduction in the serum insulin level, and increased hepatic triacylglycerol and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> contents, but had no effect on insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, quantification of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the liver revealed marked reduction of expression of gluconeogenic genes, such as those encoding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18021">phosphoenolpyruvate</z:chebi> carboxykinase (PEPCK) and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-6-phosphatase, concurrent with reduced expression of gene encoding peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha (PPARGC1A, also known as <z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi>-1alpha) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the production of super-repressor IkappaBalpha suppressed the increase in blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level after <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our results indicate that moderate inhibition of NF-kappaB <z:mp ids='MP_0005292'>improved glucose tolerance</z:mp> through decreased gluconeogenesis associated with reduced <z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi>-1alpha gene expression in db/db mice, and suggest that inhibition of NF-kappaB activity in liver is a potentially suitable strategy for the normalisation of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
