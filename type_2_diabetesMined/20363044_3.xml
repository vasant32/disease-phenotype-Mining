<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a 26-week, open-labelled, randomised, parallel-group, multinational, multicentre, treat-to-target trial, 155 insulin-naïve Asian subjects were treated with either BIAsp 30 or insulin glargine, both in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Change in HbA(1c) at end of treatment with BIAsp 30 was superior to insulin glargine (BIAsp 30-glargine=-0.36%, 95% CI [-0.64; -0.07], p=0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean self-measured plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (SMPG) at bedtime was significantly lower with BIAsp 30 than insulin glargine (7.98+/-0.34 mmol/L vs. 9.16+/-0.33 mmol/L, p=0.0078) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Incidences of minor and daytime <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> were higher with BIAsp 30 than those with glargine, but the difference did not reach the statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No difference was seen in nocturnal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of adverse events was comparable between treatments, with low incidence of serious adverse events and major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean body weight increased slightly in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In insulin-naïve Asian subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who are inadequately controlled with OADs, once-daily BIAsp 30 is superior to insulin glargine </plain></SENT>
