<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study tested the hypothesis that RBP4 is a marker of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD) or in non-diabetic control subjects without CAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serum RBP4 was measured in 365 men (126 with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 143 with CAD and 96 control subjects) and correlated with the homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> index (HOMA-IR), components of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RBP4 was detected by ELISA and validated by quantitative Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: RBP4 concentrations detected by ELISA were shown to be strongly associated with the results gained in quantitative Western blots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no associations of RBP4 with HOMA-IR or HbA(1c) in any of the groups studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> there were significant positive correlations of RBP4 with total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL-cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47773">VLDL-cholesterol</z:chebi>, plasma triacylglycerol and hepatic lipase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with CAD, there were significant associations of RBP4 with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47773">VLDL-cholesterol</z:chebi>, plasma triacylglycerol and hepatic lipase activity, while non-diabetic control subjects without CAD showed positive correlations of RBP4 with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47773">VLDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> and plasma triacylglycerol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: RBP4 does not seem to be a valuable marker for identification of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in male patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or CAD </plain></SENT>
