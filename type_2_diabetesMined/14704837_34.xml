<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We did a cross-sectional study of 3911 women who were 60 to 79 years old from 23 British towns, assessing the association of measures of lung function with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (based on fasting insulin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations) and Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (World Health Organisation diagnostic criteria) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) were inversely associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and prevalence of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In age-adjusted analyses, the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) score (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>) decreased by 5% (95% CI: 2-7%) for a one standard deviation increase in log FEV1 and by 8% (95% CI: 6-10%) for a one standard deviation increase in log FVC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With additional adjustment for height, smoking, BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, physical activity, white cell count, adult social class, childhood social class and respiratory medication, these associations attenuated to 3% (95% CI: 1 to 5%) and 5% (95% CI: 3 to 8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The fully adjusted odds ratio for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevalence was 0.85 (95% CI: 0.74-0.98) for a one standard deviation increase in log FEV1 and 0.80 (95% CI: 0.70-0.92) for a one standard deviation increase in log FVC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forced expiratory flow in the central period of FVC was not associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Lung function measures which predominantly reflect lung volume are inversely associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These associations could reflect childhood exposures which affect lung growth and also programme <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
