<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first use of this biobank investigates the effects of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) Pro12Ala polymorphism on integrative tissue-specific <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesised that Ala12 allele carriers demonstrate greater adipose tissue metabolic flexibility and insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: From a comprehensive population register, subjects were recruited into a biobank, which was genotyped for the Pro12Ala polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twelve healthy male Ala12 carriers and 12 matched Pro12 homozygotes underwent detailed physiological phenotyping using stable isotope techniques, and measurements of blood flow and arteriovenous differences in adipose tissue and muscle in response to a mixed meal containing [1,1,1-(13)C]tripalmitin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 6,148 invited subjects, 1,072 were suitable for inclusion in the biobank </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among Pro12 homozygotes, insulin sensitivity correlated with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> concentrations, and inversely correlated with blood pressure, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> and total cholesterol concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ala12 carriers showed no such correlations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the meal study, Ala12 carriers had lower plasma NEFA concentrations, higher adipose tissue and muscle blood flow, and greater insulin-mediated postprandial hormone-sensitive lipase suppression along with greater insulin sensitivity than Pro12 homozygotes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: This study shows that a recruit-by-genotype approach is feasible and describes the biobank's first application, providing tissue-specific physiological findings consistent with the epidemiological observation that the PPAR Ala12 allele protects against the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
