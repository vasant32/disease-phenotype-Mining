<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The data presented from these recent studies raise serious doubt concerning the commonly held view that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> is the principal cause of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>: first of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> they provide evidence that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> may not be the primary genetic factor for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; secondly, they demonstrate that at least under certain circumstances <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> is not essential for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> to occur, and then finally, they indicate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> may not be the predominant factor determining the degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although these studies suggest that the role of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> relative to that of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta-cell dysfunction</z:hpo> in the pathogenesis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> has been generally overestimated, one should not be left with the impression that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> is not important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is certainly an important factor in determining the degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> present at a given level of beta-cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The improvement in glycaemic control after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> which lessens <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> or after the administration of pharmacologic agents that improve insulin sensitivity clearly argue that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> is important in this regard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition to influencing the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> is probably also important in determining the time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It may do this simply by altering the balance between the body's demand for insulin and the ability of the pancreas to provide insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It might adversely affect beta-cell function in addition to increasing the demand for insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This concept is schematically represented in figure 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is well established that beta-cell function normally deteriorates as a function of age [41] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although the prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> increases as a function of age, this by itself obviously does not result in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the great majority of people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In such individuals their insulin sensitivity is sufficient to maintain the balance between the supply and demand for insulin above the threshold for developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Theoretically one may postulate three other situations originating with a genetic beta-cell defect: some people may start off life with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> beta-cell function but experience a genetically determined accelerated deterioration; some people may start off life with reduced beta-cell function (e.g. less beta-cell s); still others may start off with reduced beta-cell function and have an accelerated rate of deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In each of the above situations, at any given level of beta-cell function, the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> present would alter the threshold for developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> and ultimately type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; in other words, the greater the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, the lower the threshold, the earlier the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and the more severe the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> will be </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It follows therefore that efforts to diminish <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and to preserve beta-cell function should both be beneficial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>Weight loss</z:hpo> and increased physical activity, both of which reduceinsulin resistance, have been shown to prevent progression of people with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Whether this is simply due to shifting the balance between insulin requirements and insulin availability or whether it also involves an improvement in beta-cell function and/or prevention of its deterioration remains to be clarified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it is not known whether pharmacologic agents which improve insulin sensitivity have similar effects </plain></SENT>
