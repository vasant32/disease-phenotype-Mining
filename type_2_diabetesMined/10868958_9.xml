<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to examine whether it is possible to obtain accurate secretory rates from the extended combined model, which provides insulin and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> kinetics from plasma measurements of the two <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Equimolar intraportal infusions of insulin and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> that are designed to simulate insulin secretion rates during both oral and intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests were used to generate plasma insulin and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> data in conscious dogs that were examined under clamped <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The plasma <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> kinetics were analyzed using the extended combined model to generate estimates of prehepatic insulin secretion that were then compared with the known intraportal infusion rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The extended combined model was able to reproduce the known intraportal infusion profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The model-predicted rates were similar to those calculated with methods that require separate assessment of C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> kinetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Simulation results supported lesser clearance of insulin during rapid changes of portal insulin (as measured by an intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test) versus slow changes in portal insulin (as measured by an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The extended combined model accurately calculates prehepatic insulin appearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It may be possible to apply this approach to large studies of beta-cell function designed to identify changes in islet function in subjects at risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Such an approach could strengthen epidemiological and genetic studies of the pathogenesis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
