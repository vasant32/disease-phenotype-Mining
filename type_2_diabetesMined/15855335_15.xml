<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We recently showed that treatment with the Cu(II)-selective <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38161">chelator</z:chebi>, trientine, alleviates <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> in diabetic rats, improves <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> in humans with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and increases urinary Cu excretion in both diabetic rats and humans compared with nondiabetic control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we characterized the homeostasis of Cu and eight other nutritionally essential elements in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> under fully residential conditions in male subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and age-matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We then probed elemental balance with oral trientine in a parallel-group, placebo-controlled study in these subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Before treatment, there were no detectable between-group differences in the balance of any element, although urinary output of several elements was greater in diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean extracellular <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (EC-SOD) activity was elevated in diabetic subjects, and its activity correlated strongly with the interaction between [Cu]serum and HbA1c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Trientine caused the Cu balance to become negative in diabetic subjects through elevated urinary Cu losses and suppressed elevated EC-SOD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Basal urinary Cu predicted urinary Cu losses during treatment, which caused extraction of systemic Cu(II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We suggest that cardiovascular complications in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> might be better controlled by therapeutic strategies that focus on lowering plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and loosely bound systemic Cu(II) </plain></SENT>
