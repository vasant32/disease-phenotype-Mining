<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to directly assess the effects of resistin (0-24 h) on basal and insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake and metabolism in skeletal muscle cells and to investigate the mechanisms responsible for the effects of resistin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used L6 rat skeletal muscle cells and examined [(3)H]2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15866">deoxyglucose</z:chebi> uptake, GLUT4 translocation and GLUT protein content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We assessed <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism by measuring the incorporation of D-[U-(14)C]<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> into <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi>, (14)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> production, as well as the phosphorylation level and total protein content of insulin signalling proteins, including insulin receptor beta-subunit (IRbeta), insulin receptor substrate (IRS), Akt and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treatment of L6 rat skeletal muscle cells with recombinant resistin (50 nmol/l, 0-24 h) reduced levels of basal and insulin-stimulated 2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15866">deoxyglucose</z:chebi> uptake and decreased insulin-stimulated GLUT4myc content at the cell surface, with no alteration in the production of GLUT4 or GLUT1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Resistin also decreased <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthesis and GSK-3beta phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Insulin-stimulated oxidation of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> via the Krebs cycle was reduced by resistin, whereas <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> production was unaltered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although insulin receptor protein level and phosphorylation were unaltered by resistin, production of IRS-1, but not IRS-2, was downregulated and a decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Reduced phosphorylation of Akt on T308 and S473 was observed, while total Akt and Akt1, but not Akt2 or Akt3, production was decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our data show that resistin regulates the function of IRS-1 and Akt1 and decreases GLUT4 translocation and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake in response to insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Selective decreases in insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism via oxidation and conversion to <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> were also induced by resistin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These observations highlight the potential role of resistin in the pathophysiology of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
