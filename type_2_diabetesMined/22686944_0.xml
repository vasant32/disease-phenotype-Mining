<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of rivoglitazone, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> in the thiazolidinedione class, in subjects with suboptimally controlled type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Subjects aged ≥18 years with T2DM and <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA1c) &gt;7.0% and ≤8.5%, who were treatment naïve or receiving a non-thiazolidinedione antidiabetes monotherapy, entered a 2-week washout and single-blind placebo run-in period and were then randomized 2 : 4 : 11 : 11 to double-blind treatment with placebo, rivoglitazone 1.0 mg/day, rivoglitazone 1.5 mg/day, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> 45 mg/day, for 26 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 1912 subjects received placebo (n = 137), rivoglitazone 1.0 mg (n = 274), rivoglitazone 1.5 mg (n = 750) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (n = 751) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rivoglitazone 1.5 mg was statistically superior (p = 0.0339) and rivoglitazone 1.0 mg was non-inferior (p = 0.0339) to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> in reducing HbA1c from baseline (changes of -0.7%, -0.4% and -0.6%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rivoglitazone also significantly reduced fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> from baseline (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rivoglitazone significantly improved estimates of insulin sensitivity, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> levels, and other metabolic and inflammatory biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rivoglitazone was generally well tolerated at both doses, with treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) rates similar to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most common drug-related TEAEs were peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> (active, 5.2-6.2%; placebo 0.7%), <z:mp ids='MP_0001260'>increased weight</z:mp> (active, 1.6-3.1%; placebo, 0%) and pitting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> (active, 1.3-2.2%; placebo, 0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In subjects with suboptimally controlled T2DM, rivoglitazone 1.5 mg was associated with statistically superior glycaemic control to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> 45 mg, while rivoglitazone 1.0 mg was non-inferior; the safety profiles of the two drugs appeared similar </plain></SENT>
