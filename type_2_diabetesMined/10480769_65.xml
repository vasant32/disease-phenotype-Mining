<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between weight change and duration of overweight and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and the incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a cohort of middle-aged British men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We carried out a prospective study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> in men aged 40-59 years at screening (1978-1980), drawn from one general practice in 24 British towns, who completed a postal questionnaire 5 years later (Q5) and for whom data on BMI at year 1 (Q1) and Q5 were available (n = 7,100) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Men with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at Q1 or Q5 and men with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> at Q1 were excluded from the study (n = 184) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The main outcome measure was type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (physician-diagnosed) during a mean follow-up period of 12 years starting at Q5 (1983-1985) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the 6,916 men with no history or evidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, there were 237 incident cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during the mean follow-up period of 12 years, a rate of 3.2/1,000 person-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Substantial <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> (&gt;10%) was associated with a significant increase in risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with that in men with stable weight (relative risk [RR] 1.61 [95% CI 1.01-2.56]) after adjustment for age, initial BMI, and other risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Excluding men who developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> within 4 years after the period of weight change increased the risk further (1.81 [1.09-3.00]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjustment and exclusion of men who developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> early in the follow-up, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> (&gt; or =4%) was associated with a reduction in the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, compared with that in the stable group, that reached marginal significance (0.65 [0.42-1.03], P = 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A test for trend that fitted weight change as a continuous covariate showed the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> to increase significantly from maximum <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> to maximum <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> (P = 0.0009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The lower risk associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> was seen in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (&gt; or =28 kg/m2) and nonobese subjects and in men with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (&lt;6.1 mmol/l) and high (&gt; or =6.1 mmol/l) nonfasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although not statistically significant, this is consistent with a benefit from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> increased progressively and significantly with increasing levels of initial BMI and also with the duration of overweight and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the critical importance of overweight and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, particularly of long duration, in the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The data support current public health recommendations to reduce the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by preventing <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> in middle-aged men who are not overweight and by encouraging <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> in overweight and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> men </plain></SENT>
