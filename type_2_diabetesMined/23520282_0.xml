<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The specific cellular underpinnings or mechanisms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (IR) are not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here I present evidence to support a causal association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> energetics and IR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A large body of literature indicates that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> capacity for oxidative metabolism is lower in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Whether or not mitochondria play a causal role in IR is hotly debated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>First, IR can be caused by many factors, many of which may or may not involve mitochondria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These include <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> overload, <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus the first tenet of an argument supporting a role for mitochondria in IR is that mitochondria derangements can cause IR, but IR does not have to involve mitochondria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The second tenet of this argument is that animal models in which oxidative metabolism are completely abolished are not always physiologically or pathologically relevant to human IR, in which small metabolic perturbations can have profound effects over a prolonged period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Lastly, mitochondria are complex organelles, with diverse functions, including links with cell signaling, <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, which in turn can be connected with IR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In summary, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> "deficiency" is not merely a reduced energy generation or low fatty acid oxidation; this concept should be expanded to numerous additional important functions, many of which can cause IR if perturbed </plain></SENT>
