<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A modified 75-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test was administered to women during each pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These women and, from the age of 5 years, their children were followed biennially with a standardized examination that includes measurement of height and weight and a standard 75-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test administered in the morning after an overnight fast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during pregnancy is a major risk factor for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> in the offspring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> in the next generation is less common among breast-fed children (6.9 and 30.1% among offspring of nondiabetic and diabetic women, respectively) than among bottle-fed children (11.9 and 43.6%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during pregnancy is influenced by conditions, such as birth weight, known to influence the prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in this population in general </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The highest rates of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during pregnancy at 25-34 years of age (25%) were found among women with a birth weight below 2.5 kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The infant of the woman with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during pregnancy is at risk of becoming <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at a young age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in women of childbearing age is influenced by factors occurring early in life (i.e., birth weight and type of infant feeding) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Whether or not the long-term adverse outcomes, including diabetic pregnancies in the next generation, can be lessened or prevented by meticulous control of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during pregnancy, careful attention to intrauterine growth, or more general infant breast-feeding remains unknown </plain></SENT>
