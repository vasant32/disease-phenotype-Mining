<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, the IL-6 promoter polymorphism, at position -174 (G &gt; C), has been associated to insulin sensitivity although contrasting data have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the IL-6-174 G &gt; C polymorphism on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 238 type 2 diabetic patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> and in 255 control subjects, age and gender-matched, we evaluated the IL-6 -174 G &gt; C genotype, the IL-6 plasma levels and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> by the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The levels of IL-6 and HOMA were not genotype-dependent and were higher in diabetic patients (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Control subjects, both C+ (CG + CC genotypes) and C- (GG genotype) carriers, showed IL-6 plasma levels significantly related to BMI, fasting insulin and HOMA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The same relationships were found in C+ diabetic carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Differently, diabetic C- carriers did not show any relationship between IL-6 levels and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the evaluated variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the correlations were dependent on BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings highlight that IL-6-174 G &gt; C polymorphism affects <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, where C+ carriers have an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> "IL-6-sensitive", while C- carriers do not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The identification of two categories of diabetic patients may, therefore, lead to different therapeutic strategies in the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
