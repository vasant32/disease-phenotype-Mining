<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that 1) 48-h continuous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring (CGM) provides additional, clinically relevant, information to that provided by the A1C measurement and 2) glycemic profiles differ significantly between day on and day off dialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: With the use of GlucoDay S, 48-h CGM was performed in 19 type 2 diabetic subjects undergoing hemodialysis to capture consecutive 24-h periods on and off dialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Energy intake was calculated using food diaries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A1C was assayed by a high-performance liquid chromatography method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CGM data were available for 17 subjects (13 male) with a mean (range) age of 61.5 years (42-79 years) and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration of 18.8 years (4-30 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 24-h CGM area under the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> curve and 24-h mean <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> values were significantly higher during the day off dialysis than on dialysis (5,932.1 +/- 2,673.6 vs. 4,694 +/- 1,988.0 mmol x 3 min(-1) x l(-1), P = 0.022, and 12.6 +/- 5.6 vs. 9.8 +/- 3.8 mmol/l, P = 0.013, respectively), independent of energy intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> occurred in 4 subjects, 3 within 24 h of dialysis, and the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> nadir in 14 subjects occurred within 24 h of dialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> values are significantly lower on dialysis days than on nondialysis days despite similar energy intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The risk of asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> was highest within 24 h of dialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Physicians caring for patients undergoing hemodialysis need to be aware of this phenomenon and consider enhanced glycemic monitoring after a hemodialysis session </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CGM provides glycemic information in addition to A1C, which is potentially relevant to clinical management </plain></SENT>
