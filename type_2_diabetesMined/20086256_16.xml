<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated barriers to insulin initiation following a new prescription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We surveyed insulin-na√Øve patients with poorly controlled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, already treated with two or more oral agents who were recently prescribed insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared responses for respondents prescribed, but never initiating, insulin (n = 69) with those dispensed insulin (n = 100) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Subjects failing to initiate prescribed insulin commonly reported misconceptions regarding insulin risk (35% believed that insulin causes <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputations</z:mpath>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027051" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MR|mi|AMI">heart attacks</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, or early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>), plans to instead work harder on behavioral goals, sense of personal failure, low self-efficacy, injection <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0349231" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">phobia</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> concerns, negative impact on social life and job, inadequate health literacy, health care provider inadequately explaining risks/benefits, and limited insulin self-management training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Primary adherence for insulin may be improved through better provider communication regarding risks, shared decision making, and insulin self-management training </plain></SENT>
