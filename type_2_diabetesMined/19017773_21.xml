<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a trial of 83 adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> randomized to receive usual care plus Web-based care management or usual care alone between August 2002 and May 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had GHb &gt; or =7.0%, had Web access from home, and could use a computer with English language-based programs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intervention patients received 12 months of Web-based care management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Web-based program included patient access to electronic medical records, secure e-mail with providers, feedback on blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> readings, an educational Web site, and an interactive online diary for entering information about exercise, diet, and medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was change in GHb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: GHb levels declined by 0.7% (95% CI 0.2-1.3) on average among intervention patients compared with usual-care patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol levels, and use of in-person health care services did not differ between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Care management delivered through secure patient Web communications improved glycemic control in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
