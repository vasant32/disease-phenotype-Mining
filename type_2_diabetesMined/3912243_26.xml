<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Under controlled dietary conditions, metabolic studies were performed before and in steady state after the last exercise session after training in the subjects showing signs of physical training in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30047">VO2</z:chebi> max and heart rate measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No changes occurred in body weight, body cell mass, body fat or adipose tissue cellularity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance was improved in the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In both diabetic and control subjects initially elevated C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> concentrations decreased, while low C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> values increased and which was particularly pronounced in diabetic subjects with subnormal values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Peripheral insulin values did not change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> disposal rate measured with the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> clamp technique was similar in diabetic patients and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An improvement was seen at both submaximal and maximal insulin levels in both groups, correlating with improvement in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance in the diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No changes were found in adipocytes in insulin binding or the antilipolytic effect of insulin at submaximal insulin levels, but there was a normalization of a decreased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> incorporation into <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that both insulin secretion and effectiveness are altered by physical training in different ways in different clinical entities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>They suggest that in insulin resistant conditions with high insulin secretion (as indicated by high C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> concentrations) the increased peripheral insulin sensitivity is followed by a <z:mp ids='MP_0003059'>decreased insulin secretion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This is not associated with an improvement of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with low insulin secretion, an <z:mp ids='MP_0003058'>increased insulin secretion</z:mp> results from physical training, perhaps due to accompanying sensitization of the autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Peripheral insulin concentrations are not altered, suggesting that the extra insulin produced is captured by the liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This mechanism, as well as the improved peripheral insulin responsiveness seen in the whole body and also seen at the cellular level, probably both contribute to an improvement in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
