<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> 1 (GLP-1) is a proglucagon derivative secreted primarily from the L-cells of the small intestinal mucosa in response to the ingestion of meals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>GLP-1 stimulates insulin secretion and inhibits glucagon secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has previously been shown that intravenous or subcutaneous administration of GLP-1 concomitant with intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> results in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> in healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because GLP-1 is also effective in type 2 diabetic patients and is currently being evaluated as a therapeutic agent, it is important to investigate whether GLP-1 may cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> in such patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that GLP-1 does not cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> type 2 diabetic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> amounting to 5.4 +/- 1.1 according to homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated diabetic patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or close to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Eight lean type 2 diabetic patients (group 1) aged 60 years (range 50-72) with BMI 23.1 kg/m(2) (20.3-25.5) and HbA(1c) 8.0% (6.9-11.4) and eight patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0006280'>chronic pancreatitis</z:hpo> (group 2) aged 52 years (41-62) with BMI 21.9 kg/m(2) (17.6-27.3) and HbA(1c) 7.8% (6.2-12.4) were given a subcutaneous injection of 1.5 nmol GLP-1/kg body wt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Then, 15 min later, at the time of peak GLP-1 concentration, plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (PG) was raised to 15 mmol/l with an intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> bolus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HOMA (mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> amounting to 1.9 +/- 0.3 and 1.7 +/- 0.5 in the two groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In both groups, PG decreased rapidly and stabilized at 7.5 mmol/l (range 3.9-10.1) and 7.2 mmol/l (3.1-10.9) in groups 1 and 2, respectively, after 90 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Neither symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> nor biochemical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> were observed in any patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that a GLP-1-based therapy would not be expected to be associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> in insulin-sensitive type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
