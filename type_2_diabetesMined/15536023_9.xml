<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A month after starting insulin, participants completed a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQ) and a Well-being Questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At seven months, the same questionnaires and clinical measurements were repeated and, in addition, patients completed a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (change) (DTSQc) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean HbA1c decreased from 9.69 to 8.26% (P &lt; 0.001), and the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile showed a corresponding improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BMI increased from 30.9 to 32.0 kgm(-2) (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Perceived frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> decreased (P = 0.021), correlating with the change in HbA1c (r = 0.399, P = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The DTSQc showed improvements at seven months in scores for treatment satisfaction, convenience, flexibility, understanding of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, willingness to recommend the treatment to others, and satisfaction to continue current treatment (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In summary, after seven months of insulin treatment, patients reported positive changes in their perception of treatment satisfaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings, in conjunction with the known health benefits of improved glycaemic control, should encourage practitioners to consider insulin early in the management of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
