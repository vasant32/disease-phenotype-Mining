<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 435 diabetic patients were evaluated on complete foot examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Body mass measurements, resting blood pressure, fasting blood measures, urinary albumin-to-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio (ACR) and the digitally stored fundus images were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) The prevalence of DPN was 61.8% among the Chinese patients diagnosed with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> aged over 30 in the Shanghai downtown, 59.1% with vibration perception threshold &gt; or =25 V and 13.8% with inability to feel the monofilament </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(2) DPN was significantly associated with age (beta: 0.068, S.E.: 0.013, OR: 1.070, CI: 1.043-1.098, P&lt;0.001) and HbA1c (beta: 0.224, S.E.: 0.081, OR: 1.251, CI: 1.067-1.466, P=0.006) by a logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(3) The percentage of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (DR) in the DPN group (26.5%) was significantly higher than that in the non-DPN group (15.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(4) The percentage of macroalbuminuria in the DPN group (9.0%) was significantly higher than that in the non-DPN group (1.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of DPN observed in the Chinese patients diagnosed with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> aged over 30 in the Shanghai downtown reached up to 61.8% though the observations in our study might be representative of the diabetic patients of the Shanghai downtown </plain></SENT>
