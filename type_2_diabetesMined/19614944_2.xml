<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This multicentre, double-blind, parallel-group study randomized 299 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> to receive 30 mg/day <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> or placebo for 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After this time, patients continued with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>, either 30 mg [if glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA(1c)) &lt;or=6.5%] or titrated up to 45 mg (if HbA(1c) &gt;6.5%), or placebo for a further 4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary efficacy end-point was improvement in HbA(1c) (per cent change) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Secondary end-points included changes in fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG), insulin, C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, proinsulin and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The proinsulin/insulin ratio and homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-IR) and homeostasis model assessment of beta-cell function (HOMA-B) were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">Pioglitazone</z:chebi> add-on therapy to failing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and sulphonylurea or glinide combination therapy showed statistically more significant glycaemic control than placebo addition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The between-group difference after 7 months of triple therapy was 1.18% in HbA(1c) and -2.56 mmol/l for FPG (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Almost half (44.4%) of the patients in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> group who had a baseline HbA(1c) level of &lt;8.5% achieved the HbA(1c) target of &lt; 7.0% by final visit compared with 4.9% in the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When the baseline HbA(1c) level was &gt;or= 8.5%, 13% achieved the HbA(1c) target of &lt; 7.0% in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> group and none in the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>HOMA-IR, insulin, proinsulin and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> decreased and HOMA-B increased in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> group relative to the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients who were not well controlled with dual combination therapy, the early addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> improved HbA(1c), FPG and surrogate measures of beta-cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients were more likely to reach target HbA(1c) levels (&lt; 7.0%) with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> treatment if their baseline HbA(1c) levels were &lt; 8.5%, highlighting the importance of early triple therapy </plain></SENT>
