<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to assess the effect of high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> on circulating DPP-IV activity in patients with type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Plasma DPP-IV activity was measured in 29 patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 29 age-, sex- and BMI-matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also assessed DPP-IV activity in 31 type 2 diabetic patients with HbA1c &gt; 8.5% and in plasma from matched groups of 31 newly diagnosed diabetic subjects with HbA1c &lt; 7.5%, 31 subjects with IGT and 62 subjects with NGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a further sample of 66 type 2 diabetic patients, a longitudinal study was also performed to evaluate variations in DPP-IV activity and HbA1c over 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: DPP-IV activity in type 1 diabetic patients was not significantly different from that in control subjects; however, a significant correlation between DPP-IV and HbA1c was observed in diabetic subjects (r = 0.47; p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Type 2 diabetic patients with HbA1c &gt; 8.5% showed significantly (p &lt; 0.05) higher DPP-IV activity (mean+/-SD 27.7+/-7.1 U/l) than newly diagnosed diabetic patients and subjects with IGT (22.1+/-6.0 and 18.8+/-8.8 U/l, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Variations in DPP-IV activity over 3 months in type 2 diabetic patients showed a significant positive correlation with variations in HbA1c (r = 0.26; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> induces a significant increase in DPP-IV activity in type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon could contribute to the reduction in circulating active glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 and to the consequent postprandial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> in type 2 diabetic patients with poor metabolic control </plain></SENT>
