<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim was to review the evidence for the long-term effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> on <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> outcomes in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> people or for those at risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Current evidence is mostly based on short-term studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is a systematic review of long-term outcomes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> in studies published between 1966 and 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eleven long-term studies with a follow up of more than 2 years were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results show that those with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who lost weight intentionally significantly reduced their mortality risks by 25% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> of 9-13 kg was most protective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with the risk of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> due to either family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo>, saw a reduction in this risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Those with large weight losses achievable with surgical interventions reduced their risk by at least 63% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Metabolic handling of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> improved in 80% of those already with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who lost weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Based on one large study, intentional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients appears to have a beneficial effect on mortality risk for those with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Clearly, further studies are needed to endorse this </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The risk of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> being reduced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> was shown in seven studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, the results were from studies with different analytical adjustments and outcome indices, making it difficult to make direct comparisons and should be viewed with caution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>More long-term prospective studies need to be conducted with commitment to improving the methodological quality and standardization, in order to accurately assess the long-term effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> for <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> diabetic and non-diabetic individuals </plain></SENT>
