<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of the Finland-United States Investigation of <z:mp ids='MP_0002057'>NIDDM</z:mp> Genetics (FUSION) study is to identify genes that predispose to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or are responsible for variability in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related traits via a positional cloning and positional candidate gene approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a previously published genome-wide scan of 478 Finnish affected sibling pair (ASP) families (FUSION 1), the strongest linkage results were on chromosomes 20 and 11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We now report a second genome-wide scan using an independent set of 242 Finnish ASP families (FUSION 2), a detailed analysis of the combined set of 737 FUSION 1 + 2 families (495 updated FUSION 1 families), and fine mapping of the regions of chromosomes 11 and 20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The strongest FUSION 2 linkage results were on chromosomes 6 (maximum logarithm of odds score [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MLS</z:e>] = 2.30 at 95 cM) and 14 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MLS</z:e> = 1.80 at 57 cM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the combined FUSION 1 + 2 families, three results were particularly notable: chromosome 11 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MLS</z:e> = 2.98 at 82 cM), chromosome 14 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MLS</z:e> = 2.74 at 58 cM), and chromosome 6 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MLS</z:e> = 2.66 at 96 cM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We obtained smaller FUSION 1 + 2 MLSs on chromosomes X (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MLS</z:e> = 1.27 at 152 cM) and 20p (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MLS</z:e> = 1.21 at 20 cM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the 10 regions that showed nominally significant evidence for linkage in FUSION 1, four (on chromosomes 6, 11, 14, and X) also showed evidence for linkage in FUSION 2 and stronger evidence for linkage in the combined FUSION 1 + 2 sample </plain></SENT>
