<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate reversibility of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002495'>impaired vibratory sensation</z:hpo> by short-term glycemic control, we used the TM31 liminometer and C64 tuning fork methods to measure <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients with poor glycemic control (HbA1c: 10.8+/-0.4%, mean+/-S.E.M., range from 7.9% to 16.2%) were administered strict glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Vibratory sensation before and after short-term glycemic control was evaluated, and the metabolic profile including plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, HbA1c, total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>, and free fatty acid (FFA) was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 20.0+/-2.1 days of strict glycemic control, vibratory sensation improved significantly in both upper and lower extremities, assessed by TM31 liminometer and C64 tuning fork </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Along with the improved glycemic control, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism (total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> and FFA) was significantly improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, short-term intensive glycemic control can improve vibratory sensation, metabolic changes in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism being the factors responsible for improved of peripheral nerve function </plain></SENT>
