<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 256) who had inadequate glycemic control (HbA1c &gt; or =7.0%) during previous monotherapy were randomly assigned to receive repaglinide (0.5-4.0 mg at meals), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> (200-600 mg once daily), or a combination of repaglinide (1-4 mg at meals) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> (200-600 mg once daily) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After a 4-6 week washout period, the trial assessed 22 weeks of treatment: 3 weeks (weeks 0-2) of forced titration, 11 weeks of fixed-dose treatment (weeks 3-13), and 8 weeks (weeks 14-21) of titration to maximum dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Changes in HbA1c and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) values were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The combination therapy showed a significant reduction in mean HbA1c values (-1.7%) that was greater than with either type of monotherapy Repaglinide monotherapy resulted in a reduction of HbA1c values that was significantly greater than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> (-0.8 vs. -0.4%) (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Combination therapy was more effective in reducing FPG values (-80 mg/dl) than either repaglinide (-43 mg/dl) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> (-46 mg/dl) monotherapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adverse events were similar in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Combination therapy with repaglinide and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> leads to better glycemic control than monotherapy with either agent alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Repaglinide monotherapy was more effective in lowering HbA1c levels than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> monotherapy Repaglinide/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> combination therapy was effective and did not show unexpected adverse events </plain></SENT>
