<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Australian <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> and Lifestyle (AusDiab) Study is a national, population-based, longitudinal study of adults aged 25 years and above </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total sample of 4,405 people provided complete baseline (1999-2000) and 5 year follow-up (2004-2005) data relevant for these analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and 2 h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> were obtained from an OGTT, and demographic, socioeconomic and behavioural data were collected by interview and questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multinomial logistic regression examined the role of socioeconomic position in the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and mediation analyses tested the contribution of health behaviours in this relationship </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Highest level of education was a stronger predictor of incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (p = 0.002), compared with household income (p = 0.103), and occupational grade (p = 0.202) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Education remained a significant independent predictor of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in fully adjusted models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the relationship was attenuated by the health behaviours (smoking and physical activity) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mediation analyses indicated that these behaviours were partial mediators (explaining 27%) of the socioeconomic status-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> relationship </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: Smoking and physical activity partly mediate the relationship between low education and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Identification of these modifiable behavioural mediators should facilitate the development of effective health promotion campaigns to target those at high risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
