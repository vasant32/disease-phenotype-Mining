<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The primary regulator of the KATP channel is generally accepted to be changes in ATP/<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> ratio, where ATP inhibits and <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> activates channel activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, we showed that long-chain CoA (LC-CoA) <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">esters</z:chebi> form a new class of potent KATP channel activators in rodents, as studied in inside-out patches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this study we have investigated the effects of LC-CoA <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">esters</z:chebi> in human pancreatic beta cells using the inside-out and whole-cell configurations of the patch clamp technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Human KATP channels were potently activated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17984">acyl-CoA</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">esters</z:chebi> with a chain length exceeding 12 carbons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Activation by LC-CoA <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">esters</z:chebi> did not require the presence of Mg2+ or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16708">adenine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A detailed characterization of the concentration-dependent relationship showed an EC50 of 0.7+/-0.1 micromol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in the presence of an ATP/<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> ratio of 10 (1.1 mmol/l total <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16708">adenine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi>), whole-cell KATP channel currents increased approximately six-fold following addition of 1 micro mol/l LC-CoA <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of 1 micro mol/l LC-CoA in the recording pipette solution increased beta-cell input conductance, from 0.5+/-0.2 nS to 2.5+/-1.3 nS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: Taken together, these results show that LC-CoA <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">esters</z:chebi> are potent activators of the KATP channel in human pancreatic beta cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The fact that LC-CoA <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">esters</z:chebi> also stimulate KATP channel activity recorded in the whole-cell configuration, points to the ability of these compounds to have an important modulatory role of human beta-cell electrical activity under both physiological and pathophysiological conditions </plain></SENT>
