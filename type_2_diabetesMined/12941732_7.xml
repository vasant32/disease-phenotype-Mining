<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To measure the extent to which modern intensified risk factor control has lessened the duration-specific prevalence of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> and, therefore, has decreased the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo> in Americans with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Intensified control of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and blood pressure has prevented diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> in randomized controlled trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is as yet no confirmation that subsequent treatment intensification in the community has had the same result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 6993 members of a health maintenance organization, Kaiser Permanente Northwest (KPNW), who, in 1997-1998, had dilated <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> examinations and verifiable data of diagnosis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We plotted prevalence by time since diagnosis for background diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (BDR) and proliferative diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDR</z:e>) and compared these results to identically derived 1980-1982 results from the Wisconsin Epidemiologic Study of Diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>Retinopathy</z:hpo> (WESDR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We estimated multivariate predictive models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean (+/- SD) HbA(1c) in KPNW was 7.84 +/- 1.26% versus 10.37% (standardized) in the WESDR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>KPNW blood pressure averaged 138.6 +/- 13.8/79.5 +/- 7.4 mmHg compared with 147.0/79.0 in the WESDR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>BDR was much less prevalent in KPNW, but <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDR</z:e> prevalence appeared unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>BDR preceded diagnosis in 20.8% of the WESDR subjects but only 2.0% of KPNW subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, in both populations, the first cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDR</z:e> appeared similarly, soon after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Earlier diagnosis and more aggressive control of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and blood pressure decreased the duration-adjusted prevalence of background, but not of sight-threatening proliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>More population-based research is needed to replicate and explain this unexpected finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Detecting and treating <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDR</z:e> should not be neglected on the assumption that risk-factor control has minimized its prevalence </plain></SENT>
