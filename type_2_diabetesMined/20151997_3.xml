<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is useful to know the relative efficacy of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-altering drugs in these patient populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A double-blind, parallel group trial of adult patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020443" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercholesterolaemia</z:e> at high-CHD risk receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> 40 mg/day compared <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> 40 mg plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49040">ezetimibe</z:chebi> 10 mg (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="49040">ezetimibe</z:chebi>) vs. doubling <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> to 80 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This post hoc analysis reports <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> efficacy results in patients grouped by diagnosis of T2DM, MetS without T2DM or neither </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Per cent change from baseline at week 6 was assessed for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>, total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> , non-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> , Apo A-I, Apo B and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Safety was monitored through clinical and laboratory adverse events (AEs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with doubling <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49040">ezetimibe</z:chebi> resulted in greater reductions in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, Apo B, non-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>, total cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> ratios in the T2DM, MetS and neither groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment effects were of similar magnitude across patient groups with both treatments, except <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, which were slightly greater in the T2DM and MetS groups vs. neither group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Changes in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> , Apo A-I and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were comparable for both treatments in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Safety and tolerability profiles were generally similar between treatments and across patient groups, as were the incidence of liver and muscle AEs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Compared with doubling <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> to 80 mg, addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49040">ezetimibe</z:chebi> to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> 40 mg produced greater improvements in multiple <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> parameters in high-CHD risk patients with T2DM, MetS or neither, consistent with the significantly greater changes observed in the full study cohort (clinical trial # NCT00276484) </plain></SENT>
