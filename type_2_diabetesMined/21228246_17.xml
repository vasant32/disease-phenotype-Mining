<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This randomized multicenter trial compared the safety and efficacy of a basal-bolus insulin regimen with glargine once daily and glulisine before meals (n = 104) to sliding scale regular insulin (SSI) four times daily (n = 107) in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> undergoing general surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Outcomes included differences in daily blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (BG) and a composite of postoperative complications including wound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004610" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bacteremia</z:e>, and respiratory and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001919'>acute renal failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean daily <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration after the 1st day of basal-bolus insulin and SSI was 145 ± 32 mg/dL and 172 ± 47 mg/dL, respectively (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> readings &lt;140 mg/dL were recorded in 55% of patients in basal-bolus and 31% in the SSI group (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were reductions with basal-bolus as compared with SSI in the composite outcome [24.3 and 8.6%; odds ratio 3.39 (95% CI 1.50-7.65); P = 0.003] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> &lt;70 mg/dL was reported in 23.1% of patients in the basal-bolus group and 4.7% in the SSI group (P &lt; 0.001), but there were no significant differences in the frequency of BG &lt;40 mg/dL between groups (P = 0.057) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Basal-bolus treatment with glargine once daily plus glulisine before meals improved glycemic control and reduced hospital complications compared with SSI in general surgery patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our study indicates that a basal-bolus insulin regimen is preferred over SSI in the hospital management of general surgery patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
