<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A cohort study was performed on a consecutive series of 1,945 type 2 diabetic outpatients without a foot <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Incident foot <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> were identified through the regional hospital discharge system, which contains <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> codes of current diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During a follow-up of mean +/- SD 4.2 +/- 2.2 years, 86 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for confounders, the highest quartiles of pulse pressure had a 2.39-fold (95% CI 1.14-5.02) risk of foot <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When ischemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> were considered separately, the highest pulse pressure quartile was associated with an increased age- and sex-adjusted risk (2.08 [95% CI 1.02-4.24]), whereas no increase of risk was observed for neuropathic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Elevated pulse pressure represents an independent predictor of foot <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> in diabetic patients; this parameter should be considered for the stratification of risk of ischemic or neuroischemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
