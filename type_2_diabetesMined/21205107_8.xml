<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several new oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> agents, known as 'gliptins' or 'enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-4) inhibitors', have been developed for the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and a key clinical use of the gliptins is in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are important differences in the kinetics of the interaction of different gliptins with the catalytic site of DPP-4, which may lead to varying pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and dosing regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, individual gliptins need to be characterized and here we discuss the extensively studied DPP-4 inhibitor vildagliptin, which has binding characteristics that ensure inhibition of the enzyme beyond the presence of detectable drug levels in plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As vildagliptin has been used most often at doses of 50 mg once or twice daily, in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, this review focuses on these dose regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> clinical trials employing vildagliptin (50 mg once or twice daily) as an add-on therapy to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (identified by MEDLINE search using keywords vildagliptin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> or known by authors to be in press) are reviewed, as is current knowledge of the mechanism of action of vildagliptin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vildagliptin added to a stable dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> elicits a dose-related decrease in both HbA1c and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The additional efficacy seen with 50 mg twice daily [ΔHbA1c ∼- 1.1% (-12.1 mmol/mol)] relative to 50 mg once daily [ΔHbA1c ∼- 0.7% (-7.7 mmol/mol)] is attributable to an overnight effect of the evening dose of vildagliptin, with prolonged DPP-4 inhibition and elevated fasting levels of the intact and insulinotropic form of glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Vildagliptin's therapeutic actions are primarily mediated by GLP-1 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> enhances vildagliptin's effect to raise plasma levels of intact GLP-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Vildagliptin is weight-neutral and has a very low hypoglycaemic potential, explained by its remarkable ability to enhance both α-cell and β-cell sensitivity to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, vildagliptin offers a clinically important outcome when added to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> with a twice daily dose regimen, taking advantage of its tight binding and slow dissociation characteristics that lead to a sustained overnight effect </plain></SENT>
