<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seven patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and six healthy control subjects who were matched for age, BMI, % body fat and VO(2)peak participated in a 3 days per week training program for 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity was determined pre- and post-training during a 120 min euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp and muscle biopsies were obtained before and after each clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Oxidative enzyme activities [<z:chebi fb="2" ids="50744">citrate</z:chebi> synthase (CS), beta-hydroxy-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17984">acyl-CoA</z:chebi> (beta-HAD)] and TG(m) were determined from basal muscle samples pre- and post training, while total LCACoA content was measured in samples obtained before and after insulin-stimulation, pre- and post training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The training-induced increase in VO(2)peak (approximately 20%, p&lt;0.01) was similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with control subjects, insulin sensitivity was lower in the diabetic patients before and after training (approximately 60%; p&lt;0.05), but was increased to the same extent in both groups with training (approximately 30%; p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TG(m) was increased in patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (170%; p&lt;0.05) before, but was normalized to levels observed in control subjects after training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Basal LCACoA content was similar between groups and was unaltered by training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Insulin-stimulation had no detectable effect on LCACoA content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CS and beta-HAD activity were increased to the same extent in both groups in response to training ( p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: We conclude that the enhanced insulin sensitivity observed after short-term exercise training was associated with a marked decrease in TG(m) content in patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, despite the normalization of TG(m )to levels observed in healthy individuals, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> was not completely reversed in the diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
