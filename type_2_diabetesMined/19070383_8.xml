<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Especially, in humans, there have been no reports about effect of ARBs on atheroslocerosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, there have been several reports, including ours, which indicate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2668">amlodipine</z:chebi>, a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="38215">calcium channel blocker</z:chebi>, has a unique property to cause a reduction in the intima-media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) of common carotid artery, which is established to be an indicator of early atherosclerotic lesion, in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated which of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2668">amlodipine</z:chebi> and/or ARBs might have more profound effect on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study included 104 hypertensive patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They were divided into the two groups: the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2668">amlodipine</z:chebi> group (n=58), who received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2668">amlodipine</z:chebi> (2.5-5mg/day) and the ARB group (n=46), who received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> (25-50mg/day), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3347">candesartan</z:chebi> (4-8 mg/day), valsaratan (40-80 mg/day) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi> (20-40 mg/day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> changes were examined during an average of 56.9 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2668">amlodipine</z:chebi> group showed a significant decrease in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> compared to the ARB group (-0.046 [S.E </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>0.161] mm vs. 0.080 [S.E </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>0.255] mm, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2668">amlodipine</z:chebi> has an inhibitory effect on early atherosclerotic process, and that ARBs do not have any effect on it in hypertensive patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
