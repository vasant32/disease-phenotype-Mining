<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether the A-beta- subgroup of KPD, characterized by complete insulin dependence, absent beta-cell functional reserve, lack of islet cell autoantibodies, and strong family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, represents a monogenic form of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Over 8 years, 37 patients with an A-beta- phenotype were identified in our longitudinally followed cohort of KPD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven genes, including hepatocyte nuclear factor 4A (HNF4A), glucokinase (GCK), HNF1A, pancreas duodenal homeobox 1 (PDX1), HNF1B, neurogenic differentiation 1 (NEUROD1), and PAX4, were directly sequenced in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Selected gene regions were also sequenced in healthy, unrelated ethnically matched control subjects, consisting of 84 African American, 96 Caucasian, and 95 Hispanic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The majority (70%) of the A-beta- KPD patients had no significant causal polymorphisms in either the proximal promoter or coding regions of the seven genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The combination of six potentially significant low-frequency, heterozygous sequence variants in HNF-1 alpha (A174V or G574S), PDX1 (putative 5'-untranslated region CCAAT box, P33T, or P239Q), or PAX4 (R133W) were found in 27% (10/37) of patients, with one additional patient revealing two variants, PDX1 P33T and PAX4 R133W </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The A174V variant has not been previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite its well-circumscribed, robust, and distinctive phenotype of severe, nonautoimmune-mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta-cell dysfunction</z:hpo>, A-beta- KPD is most likely not a predominantly monogenic diabetic syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Several A-beta- KPD patients have low-frequency variants in HNF1A, PDX1, or PAX4 genes, which may be of functional significance in their pathophysiology </plain></SENT>
