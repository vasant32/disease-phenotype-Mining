<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">Troglitazone</z:chebi> treatment has been associated with idiosyncratic hepatic reaction leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001399'>hepatic failure</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in some patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This raises questions regarding whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> or peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> are hepatotoxic and whether data from clinical trials are adequate to detect a signal of potentially serious drug-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235378,C0348754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">hepatotoxicity</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to assess whether the idiosyncratic liver toxicity reported with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> is molecule-specific or a thiazolidinedione class effect, based on liver enzyme data collected prospectively during phase 2/3 clinical trials with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>, a new, potent, and specific member of the thiazolidinedione class </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This is an analysis of liver function in type 2 diabetic patients at baseline and serially in 13 double-blind, 2 open-label active-controlled, and 7 open-label extension studies of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> treatment conducted in outpatient centers throughout North America and Europe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study comprised &gt; 6,000 patients aged 30-80 years with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent baseline liver function studies and were excluded from clinical trials if they had an alanine aminotransferase (ALT), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> aminotransferase (AST), or alkaline phosphatase value 2.5 times greater than the upper limit of the reference range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The main outcome measures were liver enzyme levels, which were assessed at screening, at baseline, and every 4 weeks for the first 3 months of treatment and at 6- to 12-week intervals thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with at least one on-therapy ALT value &gt;3 times the upper limit of the reference range were identified, and their case records examined in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, 5.6% of the patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (mean HbA(1c) 8.5-9.0%) had serum ALT values between 1.0 and 2.5 times the upper limit of the reference range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> therapy, most of those patients ( approximately 83%) had a decrease in ALT values, many into the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The percentages of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with an on-therapy ALT value &gt;3 times the upper limit of the reference range during double-blind and open-label treatment were as follows: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>-treated 0.32%, placebo-treated 0.17%, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi>-, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>-, or insulin-treated 0.40% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The respective rates of ALT values &gt;3 times the upper limit of the reference range per 100 person-years of exposure were 0.29, 0.59, and 0.64 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: No evidence of hepatotoxic effects was observed in studies that involved 5,006 patients taking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> as monotherapy or combination therapy for 5,508 person-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This is in keeping with hepatic data from clinical trials of another member of the class, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>, and in contrast to the clear evidence of hepatotoxic effects observed during the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> clinical trial program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the idiosyncratic liver toxicity observed with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> is unlikely to be a thiazolidinedione or a PPAR-gamma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> class effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Poorly controlled patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may have moderate elevations of serum ALT that will decrease with improved glycemic control during treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> or other antihyperglycemic agents </plain></SENT>
