<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study compares the efficacy and safety of insulin lispro protamine suspension (ILPS) and insulin glargine in insulin-naive patients with T2D and inadequate control on oral antihyperglycaemic medication (OAM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: An open-label, randomized, multicentre, multinational 24-week study of 471 patients receiving ≥2 OAMs for ≥3 months with a body mass index between 25 and 45 kg/m(2) and HbA1c 7.5-10.0% was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ILPS was injected once or twice daily vs. glargine injected once daily plus prestudy OAMs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Primary objective compared the HbA1c change from baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HbA1c change from baseline to endpoint was similar in both groups [-1.46% (ILPS) and -1.41% (glargine)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Least-squares mean difference (95% CI) for HbA1c (-0.05 [-0.21, 0.11]%), glycaemic variability (0.06 [-0.06, 0.19] mmol/l) and weight change (-0.01 [-0.61, 0.59] kg) showed non-inferiority (margins of 0.4%, 0.8 mmol/l and 1.5 kg, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Percentages of patients achieving HbA1c &lt;7.0% were 43.8% ILPS and 41.2% glargine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean daily insulin dose was 0.39 vs. 0.35 U/kg (p = 0.02) and <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> was 1.04 vs. 1.07 kg for ILPS vs. glargine (p = 0.98) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> (episodes/patient/year) was similar for ILPS and glargine (24.2 ± 28.8 vs. 23.0 ± 30.9); nocturnal (6.1 ± 10.6 vs. 4.1 ± 9.4, p &lt; 0.001) rates were higher for ILPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> was higher for ILPS vs. glargine (n = 9 vs. n = 2; p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: At endpoint, ILPS was non-inferior to glargine in HbA1c change from baseline, but associated with increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
