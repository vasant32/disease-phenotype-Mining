<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we investigated whether the promoter polymorphisms of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha; G-308A) and interleukin 6 (IL-6; C-174G) genes predict the conversion from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the Finnish <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Prevention Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Altogether, 490 overweight subjects with IGT whose DNA was available were randomly divided into one of the two treatment assignments: the control group and the intensive, individualized diet and exercise intervention group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The -308A allele of the TNF-alpha gene was associated with an approximate twofold higher risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with the G-308G genotype (odds ratio 1.80, 95% CI 1.05-3.09; P = 0.034) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects with both the A allele of the TNF-alpha gene and the C-174C genotype of the IL-6 gene had a 2.2-fold (CI 1.02-4.85, P = 0.045) higher risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than subjects without the risk genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the -308A allele of the promoter polymorphism (G-308A) of the TNF-alpha gene is a predictor for the conversion from IGT to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, this polymorphism seems to have a gene-gene interaction with the C-174C genotype of the IL-6 gene </plain></SENT>
