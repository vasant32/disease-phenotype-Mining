<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Increasing evidence is emerging of a role of perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) as an important link between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and both macro- and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microangiopathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is not known whether perivascular renal sinus fat (RSF) has an impact on <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetic</z:e> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether RSF quantified by MRI is associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> before or after exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Non-diabetic individuals at increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were recruited into the Tübingen Lifestyle Intervention Program (TULIP); 146 participants took part in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RSF was measured in axial MRI sections at the level of the renal artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Urine was collected before and after exercise stress testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Participants (age 47 ± 12 years; mean ± SD) reached a mean exercise load of 176 ± 49 W, with a mean arterial peak pressure (MAPP) of 112 ± 14 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for sex, age, visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and MAPP during exercise, RSF was significantly associated with postexercise albumin/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio (ACR; p = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No association between RSF and baseline BP could be observed after adjusting for confounders (p = 0.26), and there was no association between RSF and baseline ACR either (p = 0.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: RSF is associated with exercise-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> independently of sex, age, VAT and MAPP in a non-diabetic cohort at diabetic risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that PVAT in the renal sinus may play a role in the pathogenesis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
