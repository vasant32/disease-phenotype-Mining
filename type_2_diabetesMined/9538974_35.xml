<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe features of pediatric-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the Hispanic population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The medical records of 55 Hispanic subjects with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were treated from 1990 to 1994 in a pediatric clinic serving lower income Mexican-Americans were reviewed to assess the frequency and clinical features of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Additionally, nondiabetic siblings of several patients underwent oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance testing, and a survey of six high schools in the same county was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventeen of 55 (31%) of the diabetic children and adolescents had type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An additional 4 Hispanic children with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treated in other clinics were also identified, yielding a total of 21 subjects who were used to describe the characteristics of childhood type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At presentation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (mean BMI 32.9 +/- 6.2 kg/m2), 62% had no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002919'>ketonuria</z:hpo>, and fasting C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels were elevated (4.28 +/- 3.43 ng/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> was easily controlled with diet, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi>, or low-dose insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No autoantibodies were present in those tested, and family histories were positive for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compliance was poor, and 3 subjects developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the tested siblings, 2 of 8 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> and 5 of 8 had stimulated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo>, correlated with BMI (r = 0.80, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The school survey identified 28 diabetic adolescents, 75% more than expected (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The Hispanic enrollment at each school was highly correlated with the number of diabetic students (r = 0.87, P = 0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Genetic susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, when coupled with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, can produce type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Mexican-American children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This diagnosis should be considered in young Hispanic patients, who might otherwise be assumed to have type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and also when caring for overweight Hispanic youth with a family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, in whom intervention may prevent or delay <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
