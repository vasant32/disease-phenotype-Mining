<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The K121Q polymorphism of the ENPP1/PC-1 gene is associated with IR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to investigate the role of the 121Q variant on the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and CAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nondiabetic control subjects (n = 638), type 2 diabetic patients without CAD (n = 535), and type 2 diabetic patients with CAD (n = 434) from Italy and the U.S. were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proportion of 121Q carriers progressively increased in the three groups (27.4, 28.8, and 33.2%, respectively; adjusted P value = 0.027) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among diabetic patients (n = 969), 121Q carriers had an increased risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> before the age of 65 years (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.26, 95% CI 1.26-4.03; P = 0.006) and having a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) (n = 156) by 50 years of age (3.17, 1.46-6.88, P = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 121Q variant was also associated with an increased risk for CAD (1.47, 1.01-2.18; P = 0.049) in diabetic patients who did not smoke (n = 546) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the ENPP1/PC-1 121Q variant is associated with a progressive deterioration of the IR-atherogenic phenotype; among diabetic individuals, it is also associated with earlier <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and MI </plain></SENT>
