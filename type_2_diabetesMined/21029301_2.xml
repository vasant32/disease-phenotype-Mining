<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>β-Cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> is an important pathogenic component of both type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent findings indicate that cell signalling pathways emanating from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) play an important role in the regulation of β-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> during the progression of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Homeostasis within the ER must be maintained to produce properly folded secretory proteins, such as insulin, in response to the body's need for them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the sensitive protein-folding environment in the ER can be perturbed by genetic and environmental factors leading to ER stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To counteract ER stress, β-cells activate cell signalling pathways termed the unfolded protein response (UPR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The UPR functions as a binary switch between life and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, regulating both survival and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> effectors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The outcome of this switch depends on the nature of the ER stress condition, the regulation of UPR activation and the expression and activation of survival and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This review discusses the mechanisms and the components in this switch and highlights the roles of this UPR's balancing act between life and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in β-cells </plain></SENT>
