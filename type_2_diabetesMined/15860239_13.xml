<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To clarify the pathogenesis of altered bone metabolism in diabetic state and its underlying mechanisms, the bone mineral content and fasting levels of serum intact parathyroid hormone (i-PTH), intact osteocalcin (i-OC), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15193,50562">tartrate</z:chebi>-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) and osteoclastgenesis inhibitory factor/osteoprotegerin (OCIF/OPG) were measured in male type 2 diabetic patients and their age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, urine levels of osteoclastic markers, C-telopeptide of type I collagen (CTx), deoxypyridinoline (DPD), and N-telopeptide of type I collagen (NTx) were simultaneously determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of i-PTH and i-OC in diabetic patients were significantly lower than those in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conversely, serum concentrations of TRAP were significantly elevated in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, no clear correlation was observed between serum i-OC and TRAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was also observed that urinary excretion of CTx, DPD, and NTx was significantly increased in the diabetics as compared with the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, serum levels of OCIF/OPG tended to be higher in the diabetic group, and these values exhibited a significantly positive correlation with those of serum TRAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was found a significantly negative correlation between serum TRAP and bone mineral density (BMD) and also between serum OCIF/OPG and bone mineral density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It seems probable that OCIF/OPG has a suppressive role on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002797'>increased bone resorption</z:hpo> to prevent further loss of the skeletal bone mass in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
