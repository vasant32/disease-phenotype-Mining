<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Two long-term, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials in insulin-using patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, spanning a wide range of baseline glycaemic control, have shown that the addition of pramlintide, an analogue of the beta-cell hormone amylin, to pre-existing insulin regimens results in reductions in HbA1c that are accompanied by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To assess whether this profile of pramlintide is observed in patients approaching, but not yet reaching, glycaemic targets, we conducted a pooled post hoc analysis of the two trials, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with an entry HbA1c between 7.0 and 8.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Within this subset of patients, 80 were treated with placebo + insulin [baseline HbA1c 8.0 +/- 0.3%, weight 87.3 +/- 19.3 kg (mean +/- s.d.)] and 86 with pramlintide (120 micro g bid) + insulin [HbA1c 8.0 +/- 0.4%, weight 92.5 +/- 20.4 kg (mean +/- s.d.)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Endpoints included changes from baseline to Week 26 in HbA1c, body weight, and the event rate of severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Adjunctive therapy with pramlintide resulted in significant reductions in both HbA1c and body weight from baseline to Week 26 (-0.43% and -2.0 kg differences from placebo, respectively, both p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These changes were achieved without a concomitant increase in the overall rate of severe hypoglycaemic events (0.13 pramlintide vs. 0.19 placebo, events/patient year of exposure) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The data from this post hoc analysis indicate that the addition of pramlintide to insulin therapy may help patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who are approaching, but not yet reaching, glycaemic targets to achieve further reductions in HbA1c without concomitant <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> and increased risk of severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
