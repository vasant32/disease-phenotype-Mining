<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine whether these in vitro phenomena have pathophysiologic relevance in vivo, we studied the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> diabetic fatty (ZDF) rat, an animal model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ZDF animals had relatively higher levels of glycemia and islet insulin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> at 6 weeks of age than age-matched <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> lean control (ZLC) rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As glycemia increased in 12- and 16-week-old ZDF rats, we observed decrements in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced insulin secretion during static incubations of pancreatic islets and in insulin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels, PDX-1 mRNA levels, and PDX-1 protein binding to the insulin promoter compared with age-matched ZLC rats and 6-week-old ZDF rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To determine whether normalization of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels would prevent these defects, ZDF rats were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> beginning at 6 weeks of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">Troglitazone</z:chebi> prevented ZDF rats from becoming hyperglycemic and preserved <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced insulin responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi>-treated ZDF animals had greater levels of insulin and PDX-1 mRNAs compared with untreated ZDF animals of the same ages at 12 and 16 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> and progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> resulting from type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in ZDF rats is associated with loss of insulin and PDX-1 mRNAs and loss of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> prevented the associated defects in insulin and PDX-1 gene expression and improved insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings provide the first in vivo evidence that prevention of progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> in a model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> preserves insulin and PDX-1 gene expression </plain></SENT>
