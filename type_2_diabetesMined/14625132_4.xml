<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Five hundred and two (502) subjects aged above 40 years, obtained by a two-stage cluster sampling technique participated in this survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Casual (random) plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> estimations were done for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects after relevant personal data were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects with casual plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (CPG) &gt; or =7.0 mmol/l had oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests (OGTT) done </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fasting and 2 h post <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> load blood samples were analyzed for plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-four (34) subjects had <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, giving a crude prevalence rate of 6.8% (CI=4.6-9.0%), and standardized rate of 7.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The crude prevalence rates were 7.7 and 5.7% for males and females, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 34 diabetic subjects seen, 14 (41.2%) of them were not previously known to have <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; 83.7% of these were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Body mass index (BMI) &gt; or = 25 kg/m2 and WHR &gt; or = 0.85, family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, physical inactivity, heavy consumption of alcohol, older age as well as high social status and Hausa-Fulani or Ibibio origin were associated with significantly higher prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Port Harcourt is relatively high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Changing lifestyle associated with industrialization may explain this </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A significant proportion of the diabetic subjects are asymptomatic and undiagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The risk factors as shown in our study clearly emphasize the point that type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is to a large extent a preventable disease </plain></SENT>
