<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Moderately <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> elderly patients (n = 14, mean age 77 +/- 2 years, BMI 28.4 +/- 0.7 kg/m2) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> underwent three 180-min hyperglycemic clamp studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the control study, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> alone was infused </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the first-phase study, human insulin was infused for the first 4 min at 12 mU/m2 to mimic first-phase insulin release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the first-phase enhanced study, insulin was infused for the first 4 min at 24 mU.m-2 .min-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Tritiated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> methodology was used in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studies to measure <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production and disposal rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> values were similar in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the control study, first-phase insulin response was absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The peak insulin response occurred at 4 min in the first-phase and first-phase enhanced studies, but insulin values were substantially higher in the latter study (528 +/- 40 vs. 340 +/- 24 pmol/l, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Second-phase insulin responses were not different among the studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> production and disposal rates were not significantly different among the studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: While absent first-phase insulin secretion is a marker of abnormal pancreatic function in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> elderly patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, it is not important in the regulation of hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> output or peripheral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal </plain></SENT>
