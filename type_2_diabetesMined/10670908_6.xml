<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine hypertensive patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> were followed under long-term treatment (mean, 20.7 months) with manidipine <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi>, a Ca <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, or delapril <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi>, an <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitor</z:chebi>, at nine institutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both the treatments showed similar <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> effects, although slight but significantly larger decreases were observed in systolic and mean blood pressures at months 12 and 24 in the patients treated with manidipine (P &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The urinary albumin excretion index (AEI) tended to increase throughout the study in both treatment groups, but no significant difference in AEI was observed between the two treatment groups at any time point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overt <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> developed in four patients on manidipine but did not appear in any of the patients on delapril </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The risk of progression to overt <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> was significantly different between manidipine and delapril groups (P = 0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No increase in serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> (Cr) was observed with delapril </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average excretion indexes of tubular markers such as beta2-microglobulin, alpha1-microglobulin, and NAG tended to be higher in the patients on manidipine than in those on delapril </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taken in sum, these findings suggest that the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitor</z:chebi> delapril is more beneficial than the Ca <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> manidipine in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011881" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic renal diseases</z:e> via mechanisms other than the blood pressure regulation, partly through their different effects on tubular function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, delapril was significantly more effective than manidipine in inhibiting progression to overt <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> in hypertensive type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
