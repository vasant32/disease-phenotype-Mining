<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 198 eligible subjects (72.3% women) aged 55.2 years, from the Bellville-South community were followed-up between 2008 and 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Baseline and follow-up data collections included <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance status, anthropometric, blood pressure, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, insulin, γ-glutamyltransferase, cotinine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> and HbA1c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Progression in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance status at 3-year was the composite of new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and any worsening in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of progression in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance status was: 16.2% (32 participants including 11 with new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>), and increased in a stepwise fashion with the number of components of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> (MetS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In age and sex-adjusted logistic regression analyses, MetS [odd ratio: 3.08 (95% CI: 1.34-7.10)], HbA1c [5.26 (1.94-14.24)], <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> [0.05 (0.01-0.33)], γ-glutamyltransferase [1.99 (1.07-3.67)], <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> [1.71 (1.13-2.58)] and total/<z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> [1.45 (1.08-1.93)] were significant predictors of progression, while borderline effects were observed for baseline <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and diastolic blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Markers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> were mostly stable or improved among non-progressors during follow-up, but deteriorated significantly among progressors, resulting in significant statistical interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High rates of deterioration of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> status over time were found in our population, with nearly one-fifth of them acquiring a <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance worse status within a very short follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our study extends to this setting the well-known utility of phenotypes of MetS single or in combination, in predicting worsening in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance status </plain></SENT>
