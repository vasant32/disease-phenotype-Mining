<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data from the 2006 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, a standardized telephone survey among U.S. adults aged &gt;or=18 years, were analyzed (n = 18,814) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Patient Health Questionnaire diagnostic algorithm was used to identify major <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The age-adjusted prevalence rate of major <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> was 8.3% (95% CI 7.3-9.3), ranging from a low of 2.0% in Connecticut to a high of 28.8% in Alaska </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 25-fold differences in the rate among racial/ethnic subgroups (lowest, 1.1% among Asians; highest, 27.8% among American Indians/Alaska Natives) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>People with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were currently using insulin had a higher rate than people with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P = 0.0009) and those with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were currently not using insulin (P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Major <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> was highly prevalent among people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; the prevalence rate varied greatly by demographic characteristics and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> types </plain></SENT>
