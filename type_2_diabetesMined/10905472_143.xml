<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>For many years, the Randle <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> fatty acid cycle has been invoked to explain <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in skeletal muscle of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Increased fat oxidation was hypothesized to reduce <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results of a number of investigations have shown that artificially increasing fat oxidation by provision of excess <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> does decrease <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> oxidation in the whole body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, results obtained with rodent or human systems that more directly examined muscle fuel selection have found that skeletal muscle in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> is accompanied by increased, rather than decreased, muscle <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> oxidation under basal conditions and decreased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> oxidation under insulin-stimulated circumstances, producing a state of "metabolic inflexibility." Such a situation could contribute to the accumulation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> within the myocyte, as has been observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recent knowledge of insulin receptor signaling indicates that the accumulation of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> products in muscle can interfere with insulin signaling and produce <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, although the Randle cycle is a valid physiological principle, it may not explain <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
