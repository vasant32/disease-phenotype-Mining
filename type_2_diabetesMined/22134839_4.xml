<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Participants with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (HbA(1c) 6.7-10.0% [50-86 mmol/mol], fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &lt;16.7 mmol/l, fasting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triacylglycerols</z:chebi> &lt;3.9 mmol/l and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> &gt;1.55 mmol/l) treated with diet and exercise, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> or a combination thereof, were randomised by a central coordinator to either 3.75 g/day colesevelam (n = 30) or placebo (n = 30) for 12 weeks at three clinical sites in the USA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary measure was the change from baseline in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> kinetics with colesevelam compared to placebo treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fasting and postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> pathways were measured at baseline and post-treatment using stable isotope techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, total glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1), total <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent insulinotropic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (GIP), glucagon and fibroblast growth factor-19 (FGF-19) concentrations were measured during the fasting state and following a meal tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data was collected by people blinded to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with placebo, colesevelam improved HbA(1c) (mean change from baseline of 0.3 [SD 1.1]% for placebo [n = 28] and -0.3 [1.1]% for colesevelam [n = 26]), <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> clearance and glycolytic disposal of oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Colesevelam did not affect gluconeogenesis or appearance rate (absorption) of oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fasting endogenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production and glycogenolysis significantly increased with placebo but were unchanged with colesevelam (treatment effect did not reach statistical significance) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with placebo, colesevelam increased total GLP-1 and GIP concentrations and improved HOMA-beta cell function while insulin, glucagon and HOMA-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> were unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Colesevelam increased cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> synthesis and decreased FGF-19 concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, no effect was seen on fractional hepatic de novo lipogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Colesevelam, a non-absorbed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> sequestrant, increased circulating incretins and improved tissue <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in both the fasting and postprandial states in a manner different from other approved oral agents </plain></SENT>
