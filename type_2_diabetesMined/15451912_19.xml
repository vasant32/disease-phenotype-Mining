<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine how the major components of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> relate to each other and to the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> using factor analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The screening survey for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was conducted in 1994, and a follow-up study of nondiabetic individuals at baseline was carried out in 1999 in the Beijing area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among 934 nondiabetic and 305 diabetic subjects at baseline, factor analysis was performed using the principle components analysis with varimax orthogonal rotation of continuously distributed variables considered to represent the components of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fasting insulin was used as a marker for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 559 subjects without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at baseline, 129 developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during the 5-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Factors identified at baseline were used as independent variables in univariate and multivariate logistic regression models to determine risk factor clusters predicting the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four factors were identified in nondiabetic and diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fasting insulin levels, BMI, and waist-to-hip ratio were associated with one factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were associated with the second factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two-hour postload plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (2-h PG) and serum insulin and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> were associated with the third factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Serum total cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> were associated with the fourth factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The first and the third factors predicted the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In diabetic patients at baseline, the combination of systolic and diastolic blood pressure was the most important factor, and urinary albumin excretion rate clustered with fasting and 2-h PG levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo> alone does not underlie <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> features of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Different physiological processes associated with various components of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> contain unique information about <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Microalbunuria is more likely to be a complication of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> than a marker for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
