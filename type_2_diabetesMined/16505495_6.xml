<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of cardiorenal risk factors, their management in a routine clinical setting, and the actual achievement of international guideline targets in a large cohort of type 2 diabetic patients with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A multicentric cross-sectional study was performed in the Campania region in Italy to evaluate cardiorenal risk factors and their management in light of international guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Overall, 28,550 diabetic patients were screened in the 21 participating centers; 847 (348 male and 449 female) patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and a clinical diagnosis of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of these subjects, 749 had <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> and 98 had macroalbuminuria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Targets for blood pressure, HbA(1c), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> were reached in, respectively, 17.5, 32.3, 30.7, 47, and 55.2% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>Chronic renal failure</z:hpo> (glomerular filtration rate &lt;60 ml/min) was revealed in 41% and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> in 23.8% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to investigate a large cohort of type 2 diabetic patients with early and moderate diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> strictu sensu </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Notably, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>impaired renal function</z:hpo> can be often diagnosed in these patients even in the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, clinical diagnosis of diabetic nephopathy allows us to identify a group of patients at very high cardiorenal risk, for whom care is really difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We suggest that a correct diagnosis of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> should always be made and that <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> intake and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> should be routinely evaluated in these patients </plain></SENT>
