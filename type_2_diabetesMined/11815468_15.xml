<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> disorder due to prevalent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> associated with deficient insulin secretion or to a prevalent defect of insulin secretion associated with impaired insulin action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The definition is supported by the high frequency at which <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> can be demonstrated in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> is not a sufficient mechanism to cause <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Impaired beta-cell function is a necessary defect in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> conditions of impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> regulation; however, it manifests itself in a different manner in fasting and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the fasting state, the basal insulin secretory rate increases as a function of the progressive decline in insulin action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As such, the fasting plasma insulin concentration is often taken as a marker for insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> challenge, a specific alteration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin release is an early and progressive defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The latter might represent an intrinsic defect, but its continuous decline is affected by glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To understand the impact of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta-cell dysfunction</z:hpo> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on metabolic homeostasis, it is useful to consider the different phases of insulin secretion separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Insulin secretion can be divided into basal (postabsorptive) and stimulated (postprandial) states </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The former prevails during the interprandial phases and plays a major role during the overnight fast; the latter regulates <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism when carbohydrate is abundant and must be disposed of </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Data in animals and humans support a crucial physiological role of first-phase insulin secretion in postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This effect is primarily achieved in the liver, allowing prompt inhibition of endogenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production and limiting the postprandial rise in plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, loss of the early surge of insulin release is an early and quite common defect that may have a pathogenetic role in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011998'>postprandial hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, possibly requiring specific therapeutic intervention </plain></SENT>
