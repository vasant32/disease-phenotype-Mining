<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Moreover, addition of most currently available oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> agents increases the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vildagliptin is a dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibitor, which improves glycaemic control by increasing pancreatic beta cell responsiveness to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and suppressing inappropriate glucagon secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study assessed the efficacy and tolerability of vildagliptin added to insulin therapy in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a multicentre, 24-week, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> that was inadequately controlled (HbA(1c) = 7.5-11%) by insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients received vildagliptin (n = 144; 50 mg twice daily) or placebo (n = 152) while continuing insulin therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Baseline HbA(1c) averaged 8.4 +/- 0.1% in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The adjusted mean change from baseline to endpoint (AMDelta) in HbA(1c) was -0.5 +/- 0.1% and -0.2 +/- 0.1% in patients receiving vildagliptin or placebo, respectively, with a significant between-treatment difference (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients aged &gt;/=65 years, the AMDelta HbA(1c) was -0.7 +/- 0.1% in the vildagliptin group vs -0.1 +/- 0.1% in the placebo group (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence of adverse events was similar in the vildagliptin (81.3%) and placebo (82.9%) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, hypoglycaemic events were less common (p &lt; 0.001) and less severe (p &lt; 0.05) in patients receiving vildagliptin than in those receiving placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Vildagliptin decreases HbA(1c) in patients whose type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is poorly controlled with high doses of insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Addition of vildagliptin to insulin therapy is also associated with reduced confirmed and severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
