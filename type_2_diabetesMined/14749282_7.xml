<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> can be viewed as a failure of the pancreatic beta-cell to compensate for peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> with enhanced insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This failure is explained by both a relative loss of beta-cell mass as well as secretory defects that include enhanced basal secretion and a selective loss of sensitivity to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These features are reproduced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> exposure of beta-cells to fatty acids (FAs), suggesting that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> might contribute to decompensation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using MIN6 cells pretreated for 48 h with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30823">oleate</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi>, we have previously defined alterations in global gene expression by transcript profiling and described additional secretory changes to those already established (Busch A-K, Cordery D, Denyer G, Biden TJ: <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> 51:977-987, 2002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast to a modest decoupling of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion, FA pretreatment markedly enhanced the secretory response to an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> subsequent challenge with FAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We propose that this apparent switch in sensitivity from <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> to FAs would be an appropriate response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> in vivo and thus plays a positive role in beta-cell compensation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Altered expression of dozens of genes could contribute to this switch, and allelic variations in any of these genes could (to varying degrees) impair beta-cell compensation and thus contribute to conditions ranging from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> to frank <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
