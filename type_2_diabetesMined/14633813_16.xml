<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the combination therapy with insulin aspart, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> with the purpose of treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three defects in order to test the hypothesis that this "triple therapy" will normalize <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Sixteen <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> type 2 diabetic outpatients on human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> or MIX (regular + <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin) insulin twice daily were randomized to either triple therapy, i.e., insulin aspart (a rapid-acting insulin analog) at meals, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (which improves hepatic insulin sensitivity), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> (which improves peripheral insulin sensitivity), or to continue their <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> or MIX insulin twice daily for 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Insulin doses were adjusted in both groups based on algorithms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HbA(1c), insulin dose, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001988'>hypoglycemic episodes</z:hpo>, insulin sensitivity (clamp), hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production (tracer), and diurnal profiles of plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin were used in evaluating treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the triple therapy group, HbA(1c) declined from 8.8 to 6.8% (P &lt; 0.01) without inducing severe hypoglycemic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011998'>Postprandial hyperglycemia</z:hpo> was generally avoided, and the diurnal profile of serum insulin showed fast and high peaks without any need to increase insulin dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the control group, the insulin dose was increased by 50%, but nevertheless both HbA(1c) and 24-h blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> profiles remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity improved in both skeletal muscle and the liver in the triple therapy group, whereas no change was observed in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that treatment of the three major pathophysiological defects in type 2 diabetic subjects by triple therapy significantly improved <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> type 2 diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
