<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare the overall efficacy of combination therapies focused on fasting or postprandial blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> not adequately controlled with oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> agents alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 135 patients were randomly assigned for 3 months to 1 of 3 combination regimens with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi> (G) that addressed postprandial blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> with insulin lispro (L+G), premeal blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (M+G), or fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FBG) with bedtime <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e>+G) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At end point, HbA1c was significantly lower with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> therapies (P = 0.001) and was significantly lower for L+G (7.68+/-0.88%) compared with either <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e>+G (8.51+/-1.38%, P = 0.003) or M+G (8.31+/-1.31%, P = 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FBG at end point was significantly lower for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e>+G (8.49+/-2.36 mmol/l) compared with either L+G (10.57+/-1.97 mmol/l, P = 0.001) or M+G (9.69+/-2.89 mmol/l, P = 0.029) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean 2-h postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> after a test meal was significantly lower for L+G (10.87+/-2.88 mmol/l) versus <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e>+G (12.21+/-3.12 mmol/, P = 0.052) or versus M+G (12.72+/-3.26 mmol/l, P = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> (episodes per 30 days) was low and not statistically significant between groups (P = 0.156) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Adding a second antihyperglycemic agent, regardless of its timing of action, lowers HbA1c and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, when insulin lispro was used to focus on postprandial blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, there was a greater impact on overall metabolic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data support the importance of lowering postprandial blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> to optimize overall glycemic control and thus improve long-term outcomes </plain></SENT>
