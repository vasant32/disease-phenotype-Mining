<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have focused on the improvements in beta-cell function, while the inhibition of alpha-cell secretion has received less attention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this research was to quantify the glucagonostatic contribution to the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering effect of GLP-1 infusions in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Ten male patients with well-regulated type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (A1C 6.9 +/- 0.8%, age 56 +/- 10 years, BMI 31 +/- 3 kg/m(2) [means +/- SD]) were subjected to five 120-min <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> clamps at fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On day 1, GLP-1 was infused to stimulate endogenous insulin release and suppress endogenous glucagon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On days 2-5, pancreatic <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> clamps were performed using somatostatin infusions of somatostatin and/or selective replacement of insulin and glucagon; day 2, GLP-1 plus basal insulin and glucagon (no glucagon suppression or insulin stimulation); day 3, basal insulin only (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0342219" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">glucagon deficiency</z:e>); day 4, basal glucagon and stimulated insulin; and day 5, stimulated insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The basal plasma glucagon levels were chosen to simulate portal glucagon levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">Peptide</z:chebi> infusions produced the desired hormone levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The amount of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> required to clamp FPG was 24.5 +/- 4.1 (day 1), 0.3 +/- 0.2 (day 2), 10.6 +/- 1.1 (day 3), 11.5 +/- 2.7 (day 4), and 24.5 +/- 2.6 g (day 5) (day 2 was lower than days 3 and 4, which were both similar and lower than days 1 and 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that insulin stimulation (day 4) and glucagon inhibition (day 3) contribute equally to the effect of GLP-1 on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> turnover in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and these changes explain the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering effect of GLP-1 (day 5 vs. day 1) </plain></SENT>
