<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We estimated the incidence of recurrent cardiovascular events in type 2 diabetic patients, aged 40-97 years, followed by a network of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> clinics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The analysis was conducted separately for 2,788 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> at enrollment (cohort A) and for 844 patients developing the first episode during the observation period (cohort B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During 4 years of follow-up, in cohort A the age-adjusted incidence of a recurrent event (per 1,000 person-years) was 72.7 (95% CI 58.3-87.1) in men and 32.5 (21.2-43.7) in women, whereas in cohort B it was 40.1 (17.4-62.9) in men and 22.4 (12.9-32.0) in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After controls were included for potential predictors (familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, smoking, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration, glycemic control, microvascular complications, geographic area, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering treatment), male sex, older age, and insulin use were significant independent risk predictors (cohort A) and serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels &gt;/=1.69 mmol/l emerged as the only metabolic (negative) prognostic factor (cohort B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In both cohorts, a prior <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> episode, especially <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, was by far the strongest predictor of recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 6% of unselected diabetic patients in secondary prevention develop recurrent major <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> every year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Those with long-standing previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> show a higher incidence of recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Male sex, age, high <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels, and insulin use are additional predictors of recurrence </plain></SENT>
