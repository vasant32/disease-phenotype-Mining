<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, emerging evidence suggests that forcing the beta cell to secrete insulin at a time when it is struggling to cope with the demands of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> may accelerate its demise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Studies on families with persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000825'>hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia</z:hpo> of infancy (PHHI), the primary defect of which is hypersecretion of insulin, have shown that overt <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> can develop later in life despite <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, in vitro experiments have suggested that reducing insulin secretion from islets isolated from patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> can restore insulin pulsatility and improve function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This article will explore the hypothesis that forcing the beta cell to hypersecrete insulin may be counterproductive and lead to dysfunction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> via mechanisms that may involve the endoplasmic reticulum and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We suggest that, in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, therapeutic approaches should be targeted towards relieving the demand on the beta cell to secrete insulin </plain></SENT>
