<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We followed up 52,061 participants in the Danish Diet, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> and Health cohort for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related mortality in the nationwide Register of Causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo>, from baseline in 1993-1997 up to the end of 2009, and traced their residential addresses since 1971 in the Central Population Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used dispersion-modelled concentration of <z:chebi fb="34" ids="33101">nitrogen dioxide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29272">NO(2)</z:chebi>) since 1971 and amount of traffic at the baseline residence as indicators of traffic-related air pollution and used Cox regression models to estimate mortality-rate ratios (MRRs) with adjustment for potential confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29272">NO(2)</z:chebi> at the residence since 1971 were significantly associated with mortality from <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Exposure above 19.4 μg/m(3) (upper quartile) was associated with a MRR of 2.15 (95% CI 1.21, 3.83) when compared with below 13.6 μg/m(3) (lower quartile), corresponding to an MRR of 1.31 (95% CI 0.98, 1.76) per 10 μg/m(3) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29272">NO(2)</z:chebi> after adjustment for potential confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: This study suggests that traffic-related air pollution is associated with mortality from <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>If confirmed, reduction in population exposure to traffic-related air pollution could be an additional strategy against the global public health burden of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
