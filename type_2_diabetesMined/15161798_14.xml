<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We assessed the capacity of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> (MetS) to identify IGT in a cross-sectional analysis of 3,326 Caucasian Framingham Offspring Study (FOS), 1,168 Caucasian and 1,812 Mexican-American San Antonio Heart Study (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SAHS</z:e>), 1,983 Mexico City <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCDS</z:e>), and 452 Caucasian, 407 Mexican-American, and 290 African-American <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin Resistance</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Study (IRAS) men and women aged 30-79 years who had a clinical examination and an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) during 1987-1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Those with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treatment or fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &gt; or =7.0 mmol/l were excluded (MetS was defined by Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program's Adult Treatment Panel criteria and IGT as 2-h postchallenge <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> [2hPG] &gt; or =7.8 mmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We calculated positive (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>) and negative predictive values (NPV), population attributable risk percentages (PAR%), age- and sex-adjusted odds ratios (ORs), and areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AROCs) associated with MetS traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among FOS, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SAHS</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCDS</z:e> subjects, 24-43% had MetS and 15-23% had IGT (including 2-5% with 2hPG &gt; or =11.1 mmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among those with MetS, OR for IGT were 3-4, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> were 0.24-0.41, NPV were 0.84-0.91, and PAR% were 30-40% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among subjects with MetS defined by impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (IFG) and any two other traits, OR for IGT were 9-24, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> were 0.62-0.89, NPV were 0.78-0.87, and PAR% were 3-12% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among IRAS subjects, 24-34% had MetS and 37-41% had IGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among those with MetS, ORs for IGT were 3-6, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPVs</z:chebi> were 0.57-0.73, and NPVs were 0.67-0.72 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In logistic regression models, IFG, large waist, and high <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> were independently associated with IGT (AROC 0.71-0.83) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> study populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The MetS, especially defined by IFG, large waist, and high <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, efficiently identifies subjects likely to have IGT on OGTT and thus be eligible for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention interventions </plain></SENT>
