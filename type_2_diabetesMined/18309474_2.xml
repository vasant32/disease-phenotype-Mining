<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the autoregulation of cerebral blood flow in diabetic patients using a simple method that could easily be applied to the clinical routine screening of diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied ten patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and 11 healthy volunteer control participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Continuous and non-invasive measurements of blood pressure and cerebral blood flow velocity were performed during deep breathing at 0.1 Hz (six breaths per minute) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral autoregulation was assessed from the phase shift angle between breathing-induced 0.1 Hz oscillations in mean blood pressure and cerebral blood flow velocity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The controls and patients <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> showed positive phase shift angles between breathing-induced 0.1 Hz blood pressure and cerebral blood flow velocity oscillations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the phase shift angle was significantly reduced (p &lt; 0.05) in the patients (48 +/- 9 degrees ) compared with the controls (80 +/- 12 degrees ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The gain between 0.1 Hz oscillations in blood pressure and cerebral blood flow velocity did not differ significantly between the patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The reduced phase shift angle between oscillations in mean blood pressure and cerebral blood flow velocity during deep breathing suggests altered cerebral autoregulation in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and might contribute to an increased risk of cerebrovascular disorders </plain></SENT>
