<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the epidemiology of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in children in Philadelphia from 1990 to 1994, and to identify whether an epidemic occurred during that time period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This is a descriptive epidemiological study using a retrospective population-based registry in Philadelphia, PA, a city with large white, African-American, and Hispanic (Puerto Rican) populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> hospitals in Philadelphia that admit children were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> charts meeting the following criteria were reviewed: 1) newly diagnosed type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 2) children 0-14 years of age, 3) children residing in Philadelphia at the time of diagnosis, and 4) those diagnosed from 1 January 1990 to 31 December 1994 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Standard type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> registry data were abstracted from the charts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ascertainment of the completeness of the hospital registry was validated by data from the Philadelphia School District </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Communicable disease</z:e> records were reviewed to identify epidemics from 1987 to 1995 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 209 cases were identified, and the combined hospital and school registry was determined to be 96% complete </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall age-adjusted incidence rate in Philadelphia was 13.3/100,000/year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The highest rate by race continues to be in the Hispanic population (15.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The incidence in African-American children has increased markedly (12.8), particularly in the 10- to 14-year age-group (22.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>An epidemic of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> occurred from January to June 1993, approximately 2 years after a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025007" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">measles</z:e> epidemic in Philadelphia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The overall incidence of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Philadelphia is similar to other U.S. registries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The incidence in the Hispanic population continues to be among the highest of any U.S. ethnic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The marked increase in incidence in the African-American population may be due in part to misclassification of cases actually having type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The 1993 epidemic may have been due to beta-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> triggered by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025007" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">measles</z:e> virus </plain></SENT>
