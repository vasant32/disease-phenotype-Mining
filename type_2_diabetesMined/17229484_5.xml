<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study reports the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo>, and insulin profiles, and their relationship to lifestyle factors in 2218 young adults (aged 26-32 years; 997 urban, 1221 rural) in south India </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were drawn from a cohort of 10,691 individuals born during 1969-1973 in Vellore and nearby villages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Family history, socio-economic status, physical activity and tobacco and alcohol use were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests were performed for diagnosis (WHO recommendations) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo> and secretion were derived from plasma insulin concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median BMI was 20.0kg/m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of Type 2 DM and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) was higher in urban than in rural subjects (3.7% versus 2.1%, p=0.02; 18.9% versus 14.3%, p=0.002, respectively), while prevalence of impaired fasting glycaemia (IFG) was similar in urban and rural populations (3.8% versus 3.4%, p=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Type 2 DM, IGT, IFG or higher <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and increment were associated with higher socio-economic status (more household possessions) and higher percentage body fat, body mass index and waist/hip ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Insulin increment was lower in men with higher alcohol consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest high levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> in young rural and urban adults highlighting an urgent need for preventive action to avert a public health catastrophe in India </plain></SENT>
