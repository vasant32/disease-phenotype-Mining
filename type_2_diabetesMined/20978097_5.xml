<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because women with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> mellitus (pGDM) have elevated ectopic <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk, we tested whether deteriorated energy metabolism contributes to these abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 23 glucose-tolerant nonobese pGDM and eight women with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism during pregnancy with similar age, body mass, and physical activity underwent oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests (OGTT) and intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests at 4-5 years after delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OGTT values &lt;463 mL ⋅ min(-1) ⋅ m(-2) were considered to indicate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>pGDM were further stratified into insulin-resistant (pGDM-IR) and insulin-sensitive (pGDM-IS) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IMCL, HCL, and fATPase were measured with (1)H/(31)P magnetic resonance spectroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: pGDM had 36% higher fat mass and 12% lower insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Log-transformed fATPase was lower in pGDM (10.6 ± 3.8 µmol ⋅ mL muscle(-1) ⋅ min(-1) vs. 12.1 ± 1.4 µmol ⋅ mL muscle(-1) ⋅ min(-1), P &lt; 0.03) and related to plasma adiponectin after adjustment for body fat (r = 0.44, P &lt; 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IMCL were 61% and 69% higher in pGDM-IR (P &lt; 0.05 vs. pGDM-IS) and insulin resistant women (P &lt; 0.003 vs. insulin sensitive), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>HCL were doubled (P &lt; 0.05) in pGDM and insulin resistant women, and correlated positively with body fat mass (r = 0.50, P &lt; 0.01) and inversely with insulin sensitivity (r = -0.46, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi>-tolerant pGDM show increased liver fat but only slightly lower muscular insulin sensitivity and ATP synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This suggests that alteration of hepatic <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> storage represents an early and predominant abnormality in this cohort </plain></SENT>
