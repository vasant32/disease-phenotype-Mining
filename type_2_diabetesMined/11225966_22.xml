<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the potential of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>, a highly potent <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> at the nuclear peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma), to prevent the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> diabetic fatty (ZDF) rat or to ameliorate the condition at a later stage of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">Rosiglitazone</z:chebi> (10 micromol/kg body weight daily) was given via the diet to ZDF rats from aged 6 weeks, before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> (Prevention group), or from aged 21 weeks after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> were established (Intervention group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Untreated ZDF rats and age-matched <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> lean rats (ZL) served as controls and the experiment was terminated when the animals were aged 28 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Whilst the combined ZDF control and Intervention groups were already hyperglycaemic (14.6 +/- 1.6 vs. ZL 5.7 +/- 0.1 mmol/l, mean +/- s.e.m.; p &lt; 0.05), glycosuric and polydipsic at aged 11 weeks, and thereafter had a declining plasma insulin concentration, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> Prevention treatment maintained normoglycaemia even at aged 27 weeks (3.7 +/- 0.3 mmol/l vs. ZL 3.0 +/- 0.3 mmol/l; NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intervention treatment at aged 21 weeks, however, failed to ameliorate the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These functional data were supported by determinations of pancreatic insulin content (microg/mg tissue as follows: ZL, 43.1 +/- 3.9; ZDF control (28 weeks) + ZDF Intervention control (21 weeks), 6.0 +/- 0.8; Prevention, 63.6 +/- 15.8; Intervention, 6.2 +/- 0.9) and by morphological, immunohistochemical and electron microscopical examination of pancreata at the end of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, islets from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> Prevention rats were similar to ZL rats, whereas ZDF controls and Intervention rats exhibited islets depleted of insulin, with a disorganized architecture and an ultrastructure indicative of work <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ZDF control rats and Intervention rats, though not <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> Prevention rats, also exhibited marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo>, indicative of renal glomerular damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that in ZDF rats, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> prevents the progression from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> to overt <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data provide a rationale for investigating whether treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> of patients with early signs of perturbed <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism (e.g. impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (IGT)) may prevent the progression to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and its associated complications </plain></SENT>
