<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The reported <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and immunoreactive insulin (IRI) responses to oral and intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in subjects with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have not always been consistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This may have resulted from variations in the method of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> administration, the ethnic backgrounds of subjects, the diagnostic criteria applied, the duration of the disease or IRI assay methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The use of a mixed meal rather than <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> has been shown to provide a more physiological stimulus to the pancreatic beta-cell due to both <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and non-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> secretagogues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have analysed the metabolic and hormonal responses of 188 newly diagnosed Caucasian subjects with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 38 non-diabetic subjects to a 500 kcal mixed meal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diabetic subjects were stratified according to fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) (&lt; 9, 9-12, 12-15 and &gt; or = 15 mmol/l) and body mass index (BMI) (&lt; 26.5, 26.5-30 and &gt; or = 30 kg/m2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increasing FPG was associated with higher peak <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations and increasing failure to achieve basal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels by 4 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median fasting IRI concentrations were similar to those of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> diabetic subjects had reduced early-phase insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Diabetic subjects with FPG &lt; 9 mmol/l showed augmented IRI area under the curve (AUC) at 2 and 4 h, whereas those with FPG &gt; 9 mmol/l had progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> in IRI AUC to below that of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects (P &lt; 0.0001 for the trend) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Peak IRI concentrations declined progressively with increasing FPG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Despite equivalent <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> exposure simple trends of increasing AUC, IRI with increasing BMI were statistically significant (P &lt; 0.001, P &lt; 0.02, P &lt; 0.001 and P &lt; 0.01, respectively for each FPG group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both fasting and AUC non-esterified fatty acid concentrations increased significantly with FPG regardless of BMI (P &lt; 0.001 for the trends) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results using a more physiological mixed meal challenge in a large number of recently diagnosed Type 2 diabetic subjects demonstrate a marked and increasing loss of beta-cell secretory function with increasing fasting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> aggravated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> with increasing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
