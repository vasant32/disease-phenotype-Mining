<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE This prospective randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study examined the effects of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="26710">sodium chloride</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi>) supplementation on the antialbuminuric action of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi> with or without hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) in hypertensive patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>increased albumin excretion</z:mp> rate (AER), and habitual low dietary salt intake (LDS; &lt;100 mmol <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>/24 h on two of three consecutive occasions) or high dietary salt intake (HDS; &gt;200 mmol <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>/24 h on two of three consecutive occasions) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Following a washout period, subjects (n = 32) received 40 mg/day <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi> for 4 weeks followed by 40 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi> plus 12.5 mg/day HCT for 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For the last 2 weeks of each treatment period, patients received either 100 mmol/day <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> or placebo capsules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After a second washout, the regimen was repeated with supplements in reverse order </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AER and ambulatory blood pressure were measured at weeks 0, 4, 8, 14, 18, and 22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS In LDS, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> supplementation reduced the anti-albuminuric effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi> with or without HCT from 42.3% (placebo) to 9.5% (P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By contrast, in HDS, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> supplementation did not reduce the AER response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi> with or without HCT (placebo 30.9%, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> 28.1%, P = 0.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Changes in AER were independent of changes in blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS The AER response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi> with or without HCT under habitual low salt intake can be blunted by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> supplementation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By contrast, when there is already a suppressed renin angiotensin <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27584,30834">aldosterone</z:chebi> system under habitual high dietary salt intake, the additional <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> does not alter the AER response </plain></SENT>
