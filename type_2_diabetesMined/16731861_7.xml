<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sequenced the HNF4A gene of 95 MODY3-negative probands from the Norwegian MODY Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found three novel coding variants in exon 8 of HNF4A: G326R, T339I, and W340X </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In intron 7, we noted a single nucleotide polymorphism in the binding site of a previously published primer pair, which in some cases caused allelic drop out when amplifying exon 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also detected two novel sequence variants of the P2 promoter region, of which P2 -192C&gt;G showed linkage with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in two families (maximal logarithm of odds score of 3.1 and 0.8, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This variant and a surrounding haplotype restricted by 3.7 Mb was also found in two Danish MODY pedigrees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> was higher in the P2 -192C&gt;G carriers (median 45 years) compared with that reported for other MODY1 individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We could not support a biological role of the P2 promoter variant by in vitro transfection assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we have identified three novel HNF4A mutations and a 3.7-Mb haplotype, including the HNF4A P2 promoter, which was linked with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
