<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: We sought not only to determine the independent predictors of non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011881" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic renal disease</z:e> (NDRD) but also to investigate the impact of NDRD on renal outcomes in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who underwent renal biopsy and were followed-up longitudinally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The present study was conducted by reviewing the medical records of 119 type 2 diabetic patients who underwent renal biopsy at Yonsei University Health System from January 1988 to December 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Renal biopsy findings declared that 43 patients (36.1%) had diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> alone, 12 (10.1%) had NDRD superimposed on diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, and 64 (53.8%) had only NDRD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, the absence of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, higher <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels, and shorter duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were independent predictors of NDRD in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up period, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e>) developed in 33 patients (27.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On multivariate Cox regression, higher serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> levels, higher systolic blood pressure, longer duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and the presence of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> were identified as significant independent predictors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When the presence of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> was included in the multivariate model, higher serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> levels, higher systolic blood pressure, and the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> were shown to be independent predictors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Since diabetic patients with NDRD have significantly better renal outcomes compared to patients with biopsy-proven diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, it is important to suspect, identify, and manage NDRD as early as possible, especially in type 2 diabetic patients with short duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and those without diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
