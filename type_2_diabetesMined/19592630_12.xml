<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In treatment-naive patients with newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, insulin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> were initiated for a 3-month lead-in period, then patients were randomly assigned to insulin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (insulin group) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi> (oral group) for 36 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hypoglycemic events, compliance, A1C, weight, QoL, and treatment satisfaction were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 29 patients randomly assigned into each group, 83% (insulin group) and 72% (oral group) completed this 3-year study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At study completion, A1C was 6.1 +/- 0.6% (insulin group) versus 6.0 +/- 0.8% (oral group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Weight increased similarly in both groups (P = 0.09) by 4.47 kg (95% CI 0.89-8.04 kg) (insulin group) and 7.15 kg (95% CI 4.18-10.13 kg) (orals group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hypoglycemic events did not differ between groups (mild 0.51 event/person-month in the insulin group vs. 0.68 event/person-month in the orals group, P = 0.18 and severe 0.04 event/person-year in the insulin group vs. 0.09 event/person-year in the orals group, P = 0.53) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compliance, QoL, and treatment satisfaction were similar between groups, with 100% of patients randomly assigned to insulin willing to continue such treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: When compared with a clinically equivalent treatment regimen, insulin-based therapy is effective and did not cause greater <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> nor decrease compliance, treatment satisfaction, or QoL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Insulin is safe, well-accepted, and effective for ongoing treatment of patients with newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
