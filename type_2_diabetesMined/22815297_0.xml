<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Development of micro- or macroalbuminuria is associated with increased risk of cardiorenal complications, particularly in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For prevention of transition to micro- or macroalbuminuria, more accurate prediction markers on top of classical risk markers are needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied a promising new marker, growth-differentiation factor (GDF)-15, to predict transition to increasing stage of <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> in type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, we looked at the GDF-15 potential in nondiabetic subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (HT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Case and control subjects were selected from the PREVEND cohort, a large (n = 8,592), prospective general population study on the natural course of <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp>, with &gt;10 years of follow-up and repeated <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found 24 T2DM and 50 HT case subjects transitioning from normo- to macroalbuminuria and 9 T2DM and 25 HT case subjects transitioning from micro- to macroalbuminuria (average follow-up 2.8 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Control subjects with stable <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> were pair matched for age, sex, <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> status, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>GDF-15 was measured in samples prior to <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> transition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Prior to transition, GDF-15 was significantly higher in case subjects with T2DM than in control subjects (median [IQR] 1,288 pg/mL [885-1,546] vs. 948 pg/mL [660-1,016], P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio for transition in <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> increased significantly per SD of GDF-15 (2.9 [95% CI 1.1-7.5], P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>GDF-15 also improved prediction of <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> transition, with significant increases in C statistic (from 0.87 to 0.92, P = 0.03) and integrated discrimination improvement (0.148, P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In HT, GDF-15 was also independently associated with transition in <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> stage (2.0 [1.1-3.5], P = 0.02) and improved prediction significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We identified GDF-15 as a clinically valuable marker for predicting transition in <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> stage in T2DM beyond conventional risk markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These findings were confirmed in nondiabetic HT subjects </plain></SENT>
