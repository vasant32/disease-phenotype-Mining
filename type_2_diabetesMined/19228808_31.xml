<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms underlying this association are unknown and may represent intrauterine programming or two phenotypes of one genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The fetal insulin hypothesis proposes that common genetic variants that reduce insulin secretion or action may predispose to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and also reduce birth weight, since insulin is a key fetal growth factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We tested whether common genetic variants that predispose to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> also reduce birth weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We genotyped single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at five recently identified type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> loci (CDKAL1, CDKN2A/B, HHEX-IDE, IGF2BP2, and SLC30A8) in 7,986 mothers and 19,200 offspring from four studies of white Europeans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We tested the association between maternal or fetal genotype at each locus and birth weight of the offspring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk alleles at the CDKAL1 and HHEX-IDE loci were associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0009674'>reduced birth weight</z:mp> when inherited by the fetus (21 g [95% CI 11-31], P = 2 x 10(-5), and 14 g [4-23], P = 0.004, lower birth weight per risk allele, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 4% of offspring carrying four risk alleles at these two loci were 80 g (95% CI 39-120) lighter at birth than the 8% carrying none (P(trend) = 5 x 10(-7)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no associations between birth weight and fetal genotypes at the three other loci or maternal genotypes at any locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results are in keeping with the fetal insulin hypothesis and provide robust evidence that common disease-associated variants can alter size at birth directly through the fetal genotype </plain></SENT>
