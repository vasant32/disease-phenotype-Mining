<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two recent publications reported association of common polymorphisms in the P2 promoter of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha (HNF4alpha) (the MODY1 gene) with risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We attempted to reproduce this putative association by genotyping 11 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) spanning the HNF4alpha coding region and the P2 promoter in &gt;3,400 patients and control subjects from Sweden, Finland, and Canada </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One SNP that was consistently associated in the two previous reports (rs1884613, in the P2 promoter region) also trended in the same direction in our sample, albeit with a lower estimated odds ratio (OR) of 1.11 (P = 0.05, one-tailed) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We genotyped this SNP (rs1884613) in an additional 4,400 subjects from North America and Poland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this sample, the association was not confirmed and trended in the opposite direction (OR 0.88) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Meta-analysis of our combined sample of 7,883 people (three times larger than the two initial reports combined) yielded an OR of 0.97 (P = 0.27) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, we provide an updated analysis of haplotype structure in the region to guide any further investigation of common variation in HNF4alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although our combined results fail to replicate the previously reported association of common variants in HNF4alpha with risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we cannot exclude an effect smaller than that originally proposed, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> among samples, variation in as-yet-unmeasured genotypic or environmental modifiers, or true association secondary to linkage disequilibrium (LD) with as-yet-undiscovered variant(s) in the region </plain></SENT>
