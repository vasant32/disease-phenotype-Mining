<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a primary reduction in beta cell mass on beta cell function in vivo and in the perfused pancreas and to relate these characteristics to beta cell mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The beta cell mass of six GÃ¶ttingen minipigs was reduced chemically (using 67 mg/kg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17154">nicotinamide</z:chebi> and 125 mg/kg <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six untreated minipigs were kept as control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Insulin responses were evaluated in vivo using the mixed meal tolerance test (2 g/kg oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>) and in the isolated perfused pancreata from the same animals by stimulation with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 or arginine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Beta cell mass was reduced in the beta-cell-reduced animals compared with the control minipigs (182+/-76 vs 464+/-156 mg, p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AUC(<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>) was increased in the beta-cell-reduced animals (1383+/-385 vs 853+/-113 mmol.l(-1).min in control minipigs, p&lt;0.01), as was the insulin response to oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> per unit of beta cell mass (123+/-84 vs 56+/-24 pmol.l(-1).min.mg(-1), p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Total in vitro insulin secretion was increased per unit of beta cell mass in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17154">nicotinamide</z:chebi> + <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> pancreata compared to controls (83.7+/-45.9 vs 34.6+/-14.4 nmol/mg beta cells, p&lt;0.05) with responses to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 showing a partial compensation for reduced beta cell mass, whereas no compensation was seen in response to arginine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: A primary reduction in beta cell mass impairs <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance and leads to a compensatory increase in insulin secretion from the remaining beta cells after oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in vivo, which is even more apparent in the perfused pancreas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It remains to be determined whether this compensation can be maintained in the long term </plain></SENT>
