<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: This trial evaluated the potential for improving glycaemic control by intensifying a conventional twice-daily therapy with premixed human insulin (HI) to a thrice-daily regimen using premixed formulations of biphasic insulin aspart (BIAsp) in patients with type 1 or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a multicentre, open-label, parallel group trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After a 4-week run-in period, patients were randomized 1 : 1 to 16 weeks of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 748 patients were screened, 664 were exposed to trial drug and 604 completed the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">Haemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c), the primary efficacy endpoint, was shown to be significantly lower for the BIAsp treatment group compared with the biphasic HI (BHI) 30 group [estimated mean difference: -0.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) (-0.48; -0.16), p = 0.0001] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The average blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level was significantly lower in the BIAsp group [estimated mean difference: -0.79, 95% CI (-1.17; -0.40), p = 0.0001] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were few major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0745153" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemic episodes</z:e>, 11 in the BIAsp group and 7 in the BHI 30 group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although intensification of insulin therapy with BIAsp three times a day was associated with a higher risk of minor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> (relative risk = 1.58, p = 0.0038), the overall rate of minor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> remained low with both the BIAsp and the BHI treatments (13.1 vs. 8.3 episodes/patient year respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall safety and patient satisfaction were similar with the two insulin therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This trial confirmed that a thrice-daily BIAsp regimen can safely be used to intensify treatment for patients inadequately controlled on twice-daily BHI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A treat-to-target trial is required to explore the full potential of the BIAsp regimens and evaluate their use as a viable alternative to intensification with a basal-bolus regimen </plain></SENT>
