<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A defect in the liver/islet cell <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transporter (GluT 2) could explain many of the pathophysiological features of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to test the hypothesis that genetic variation at the GluT 2 locus contributes genetic susceptibility to Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 60 unrelated Caucasian diabetic patients with at least one affected sibling were genotyped for a Taq 1 restriction fragment length polymorphism marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hybridisation with a cDNA GluT 2 probe identified two alleles of sizes 13 kilobase (T1) and 19 kilobase (T2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The allele frequencies in the diabetic group with a family history were significantly different from those in a racially-matched control population of 122 subjects with no personal or family history of the disease (diabetic patients T1 = 0.96, T2 = 0.04, control subjects T1 = 0.89, T2 = 0.11, p less than 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, when the study was repeated with 54 diabetic patients with indeterminate family history, statistical significance was not reached although the allele frequencies showed a similar trend </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The findings of this study support the hypothesis that a genetic variant of the liver/islet cell <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transporter may contribute to familial susceptibility in Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
