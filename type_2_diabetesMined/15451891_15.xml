<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a multiclinic controlled trial of population management in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We created diabetic patient registries (n = 3,079) for four primary care clinics within a single academic health center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the intervention clinic (n = 898), a nurse practitioner used novel clinical software (PopMan) to identify patients on a weekly basis with outlying values for visit and testing intervals and last measured levels of HbA1c, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, and blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For these patients, the nurse practitioner e-mailed a concise patient-specific summary of evidence-based management suggestions directly to primary care providers (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCPs</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Population changes in risk factor testing, medication prescription, and risk factor levels from baseline (1 January 2000 to 31 August 2001) to follow-up (1 December 2001 to 31 July 2003) were compared with the three usual-care control clinics (n = 2,181) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients had a mean age of 65 years, were mostly white (81%), and the majority were insured by Medicare/Medicaid (62%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>From baseline to follow-up, the increase in proportion of patients tested for HbA1c (P = 0.004) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.001) was greater in the intervention than control sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Improvements in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related medication prescription and levels of HbA1c, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, and blood pressure in the intervention clinic were balanced by similar improvements in the control sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Population-level clinical registries combined with summarized recommendations to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCPs</z:e> had a modest effect on management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The intervention was limited by good overall quality of care at baseline and temporal improvements in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> control clinics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is unknown whether this intervention would have had greater impact in clinical settings with lower overall quality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further research into more effective methods of translating population registry information into action is required </plain></SENT>
