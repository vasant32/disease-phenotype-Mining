<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: A recent meta-analysis of 13 prospective studies reported that higher levels of adiponectin were significantly associated with lower risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most previous studies, however, were limited in their ability to adjust for appropriate confounding variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our objective, therefore, was to study this association after adjustment for directly measured <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> and insulin sensitivity, expressed as the insulin sensitivity index (S(I)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study included 1,096 Hispanic and African American participants free of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at baseline (2000-2002) who returned for follow-up after 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>S(I) was determined from frequently sampled intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests with minimal model analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) area was determined by computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> and impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (IFG) were defined using American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate generalized estimating equation logistic regression models were used to account for correlations within families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 82 subjects met criteria for incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, and smoking, adiponectin was significantly inversely associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (odds ratio [OR] 0.54 per 1 SD difference [95% CI 0.38-0.76]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The association remained significant after additional adjustment in individual models for BMI, homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, or VAT (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, adiponectin was no longer associated in separate models adjusted for S(I) or IFG (OR 0.81 [0.56-1.16] and 0.75 [0.53-1.06], respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Adiponectin was inversely associated with incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after adjustment for conventional anthropometric and metabolic variables or VAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Adjustment for detailed measures of S(I) attenuated this relationship, however, suggesting that the link between adiponectin and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may operate at least in part through <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
