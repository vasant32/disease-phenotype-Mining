<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> usually are highly focused </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, approaches that give a more global picture of abnormalities in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> are useful in pointing out new directions for research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In previous studies, gene expression analyses show a coordinated pattern of reduction in nuclear-encoded <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> gene expression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, changes in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels may not predict changes in protein abundance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An approach to identify global protein abundance changes involving the use of proteomics was used here </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Muscle biopsies were obtained basally from lean, <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, and type 2 diabetic volunteers (n = 8 each); <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> clamps were used to assess insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Muscle protein was subjected to mass spectrometry-based quantification using normalized spectral abundance factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 1,218 proteins assigned, 400 were present in at least half of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of these, 92 were altered by a factor of 2 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, and of those, 15 were significantly increased or decreased by ANOVA (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Analysis of protein sets revealed patterns of decreased abundance in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> proteins and altered abundance of proteins involved with cytoskeletal structure (desmin and alpha actinin-2 both decreased), chaperone function (TCP-1 subunits increased), and proteasome subunits (increased) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm the reduction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> proteins in insulin-resistant muscle and suggest that changes in muscle structure, protein degradation, and folding also characterize <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
