<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of 1,394 women, aged 60-79 years, from 23 British towns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a strong (independent of confounding factors, other early life factors, and adult waist-to-hip ratio) inverse association between birth weight and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in women in the highest third of BMI (&gt;28.77 kg/m2): -0.12 (95% CI -0.19 to -0.04) log homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) score per 1 SD birth weight, but no association between birth weight and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in women in the two lowest thirds of BMI (P for interaction = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Offspring birth weight, own leg length, and childhood manual social class did not interact with adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> independently inversely associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>: -0.05 (-0.09 to -0.01) log HOMA score per 1 SD offspring birth weight, -0.09 (-0.12 to -0.06) log HOMA score per 1 SD leg length, and a -0.07 (-0.14 to 0.00) difference in log HOMA score between manual and nonmanual childhood social class </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Childhood manual social class and shorter leg length were both independently associated with adverse <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BMI and waist-to-hip ratio were independently positively associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other components of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo> is an important risk factor for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that genetic factors, intrauterine environment, early childhood, and adult environmental factors are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> relevant in determining adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
