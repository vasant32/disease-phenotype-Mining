<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare, in men and women, the prevalence of undiagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> assessed using criteria from the American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association (<z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi>) and the World Health Organization (WHO) and to investigate risk factors associated with fasting and 2-h postload plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data from two companion surveys of Europeans, South Asians, and Afro-Caribbeans in west London were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 4,367 men and women aged 40-64 years who were not known to have <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> underwent an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test after an overnight fast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of undiagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was estimated using the <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> (fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &gt; or = 7.0 mmol/l) and WHO (2-h postload <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &gt; or = 11.1 mmol/l) criteria for epidemiologic studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The association of body fat and usual alcohol intake with plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevalence was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with the WHO criterion, the <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> criterion gave a higher prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in men (6.4 vs. 4.7%) but a lower prevalence in women (3.3 vs. 4.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In Afro-Caribbeans, the sex difference in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevalence was reversed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Women had significantly lower fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> than men despite higher 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Alcohol intake was positively associated with fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in men and women but not with 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The new <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> criterion, based on fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> alone, does not take account of sex differences in metabolic response to fasting or possible artifactual effects on fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>With the <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> criterion, alcohol intake was a significant risk factor for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in our study population; this was not the case with the WHO criterion </plain></SENT>
