<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> induced by TNF-alpha is antagonized by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> (TZDs), a new class of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">insulin-sensitizing drugs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the current study was to dissect the mechanism whereby <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>, one of the TZDs, ameliorates TNF-alpha-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in 3T3-L1 adipocytes </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of the PPAR-gamma proteins in TNF-alpha-treated adipocytes restored protein levels of IR/IRS-1, but did not improve insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IR/IRS-1 or insulin-stimulated 2-DOG uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the ability of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> to restore insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IR/IRS-1, which is necessary for amelioration of TNF-alpha-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, may be independent of the adipogenic activity of PPAR-gamma that regulates protein levels of IR/IRS-1 </plain></SENT>
