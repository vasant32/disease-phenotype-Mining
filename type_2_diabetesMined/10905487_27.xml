<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests (OGTTs) and frequently sampled intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests (FSIGTs) were conducted on Latino women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> and a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> before and after 12 weeks of treatment with 400 mg/day <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> (n = 13) or placebo (n = 12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity was assessed by minimal model analysis, and beta-cell insulin release was assessed as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin responses to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (AIRg) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27999">tolbutamide</z:chebi> (AIRt) during FSIGTs and as the 30-min incremental insulin response (30-min dINS) during OGTTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Beta-cell compensation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> was assessed as the product (disposition index) of minimal model insulin sensitivity and each of the 3 measures of beta-cell insulin release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the placebo group, there was no significant change in insulin sensitivity or in any measure of insulin release, beta-cell compensation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, or <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">Troglitazone</z:chebi> treatment resulted in a significant increase in insulin sensitivity, as reported previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In response, AIRg did not change significantly, so that the disposition index for AIRg increased significantly from baseline (P = 0.004) and compared with placebo (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>AIRt (P = 0.001) and 30-min dINS (P = 0.02) fell with improved insulin sensitivity during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> treatment, so that the disposition index for each of these measures of beta-cell function did not change significantly from baseline (P &gt; 0.20) or compared with placebo (P &gt; 0.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Minimal model analysis revealed that 89% of the change from baseline in insulin sensitivity during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> treatment was accounted for by lowered plasma insulin concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neither oral nor intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance changed significantly from baseline or compared with placebo during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The predominant response of beta-cells to improved insulin sensitivity in women at high risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was a reduction in insulin release to maintain nearly constant <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
