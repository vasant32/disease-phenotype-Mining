<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Focus groups were held with 30 participants with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Groups were comprised of African Americans (n=16), Hispanics (n=6), and Caucasians (n=8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A grounded theory approach was used to analyse and interpret findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Participants were unaware of the relationship between type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and oral health but were concerned about the influence of poor oral health on quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Having <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was reported as a potential challenge for the coordination and receipt of dental care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patient-provider communication of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and oral health needs were perceived to be inadequate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are at-risk for poor oral health, yet have limited awareness and understanding of the specific oral health care needs and risks associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This lack of awareness and understanding of the relationship between <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and oral health may be an indicator of inadequate oral health literacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Addressing the relationship between <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and oral health with patients may improve dental outcomes, increase quality of life, and promote oral health literacy in at-risk populations </plain></SENT>
