<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031090" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Periodontal disease</z:e> is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031090" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodontal disease</z:e> was related to A1C progression in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-free participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP) is a population-based cohort in Germany including 2,973 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-free participants (53% women; aged 20-81 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Participants were categorized into four groups according to increasing baseline <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031090" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodontal disease</z:e> levels (percentage of sites per mouth with attachment loss &gt;or=5 mm, determined a priori); sample sizes for each respective category were 1,122, 488, 463, and 479 (241 participants were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026644" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">edentulous</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean absolute changes (year 5 minus baseline) in A1C (DeltaA1C) were regressed across periodontal categories while adjusting for confounders (e.g., age, sex, smoking, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, physical activity, and family history) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Across baseline <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031090" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodontal disease</z:e> categories, DeltaA1C +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e> values were 0.023 +/- 0.02, 0.023 +/- 0.02, 0.065 +/- 0.03, and 0.106 +/- 0.03 (P(trend) = 0.02), yielding an approximate fivefold increase in the absolute difference in DeltaA1C when dentate participants in the highest versus lowest <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031090" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodontal disease</z:e> category were compared; these results were markedly stronger among participants with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein &gt;or=1.0 mg/l (P(interaction) = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When individuals who had neither baseline <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031090" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodontal disease</z:e> nor deterioration in periodontal status at 5 years were compared with individuals with both poor baseline periodontal health and longitudinal periodontal deterioration, mean DeltaA1C values were 0.005 vs. 0.143% (P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031090" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Periodontal disease</z:e> was associated with 5-year A1C progression, which was similar to that observed for a 2-SD increase in either waist-to-hip ratio or age in this population </plain></SENT>
