<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients (n = 600: 300 using vial and syringe and 300 using pen) were recruited from national panels to participate in computer-assisted telephone interviews </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Measures included: demographic characteristics; <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treatment and self-care factors; perceptions of pen convenience, clinical efficacy, facilitation of self-care, and cost; and degree of physicians' recommending pen use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Physician recommendation of pen use powerfully discriminated pen users from nonusers (odds ratio 135.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other factors that discriminated pen users included physicians' presenting pens as an option (14.1) and patient perceptions that pens facilitate <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-care (20.2) and are not costly (4.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The physician's role in presenting the pen as an option and recommending pen use was a critical factor in patient pen use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Enhanced physician education regarding the potential benefits of pen use and encouraging physicians to discuss pen use with patients could improve <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> outcomes </plain></SENT>
