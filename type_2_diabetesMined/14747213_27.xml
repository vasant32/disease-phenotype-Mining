<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Homeostasis model assessments (HOMAs) of insulin sensitivity (HOMA%S) and beta-cell function (HOMA%beta) were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Stepwise multivariable ethnic-specific ANCOVA models were used to compare HOMA%S and HOMA%beta between non-Hispanic whites and each of the four ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HOMA%S was lower in African Americans, Chinese Americans, and Japanese Americans when compared with non-Hispanic white women after correcting for waist circumference, presence of impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant differences persisted only between African Americans and non-Hispanic whites after inclusion of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> in the model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">Triglycerides</z:chebi> indirectly corrected for the differences in HOMA%S in the other two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in HOMA%S between the non-Mexican-American Latinos and the non-Hispanic whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Japanese Americans and Chinese Americans had lower HOMA%beta than non-Hispanic whites, whereas African Americans had higher HOMA%beta than non-Hispanic whites after correcting for confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HOMA%beta was similar between non-Mexican-American Latinos and non-Hispanic whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention strategies for African-American women should initially target decreased insulin sensitivity, whereas strategies for Japanese-American and Chinese-American women may initially need to target both decreased insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Previous studies of Mexican-American populations may not apply to non-Mexican-American Latino women </plain></SENT>
