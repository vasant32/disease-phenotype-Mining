<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In our study, we examined the influence of a polymorphism in tight linkage disequilibrium with INS-VNTR (-23Hph1) on birth weight and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the Pima population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A parent-offspring "trio" design was used to assess parent-of-origin effects and population stratification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of the -23Hph1 T-allele was associated with lower birth weight (n = 192; -140 g per copy of the T-allele; P = 0.04), even after adjustment for effects of population stratification (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effects of paternally transmitted T-alleles were greater than those of maternally transmitted alleles (paternally transmitted: -250 g, P = 0.05; maternally transmitted: -111 g, P = 0.43), but this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The -23Hph1 T-allele was associated with an increased prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P = 0.009), which family-based association analysis suggested was attributable to population structure (P = 0.04) without significant evidence of linkage disequilibrium between <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevalence and genotype (P = 0.86) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus allelic variation of the INS gene is associated with lower birth weight and increased prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant linkage disequilibrium was found between -23Hph1 and birth weight but not type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, an observation that supports a potential functional role of INS polymorphisms in the regulation of birth weight </plain></SENT>
