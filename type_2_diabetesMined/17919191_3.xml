<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Increased knowledge about beta-cell mass and function is important for our understanding of the pathophysiology of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relationship between the two is difficult to study in humans, whereas animal models allow studies of consequences of, for example, reduction of beta-cell mass and induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and procurement of the pancreas for histological examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An overview of results obtained in the GÃ¶ttingen minipig in relation to beta-cell function, and mass is provided here </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Effects of a primary reduction of beta-cell mass have indicated that not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the defects of pulsatile insulin secretion in human T2DM can be explained by reduced beta-cell mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> has shown deterioration of beta-cell function and morphological changes in the pancreas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As in humans, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> leads to an increased beta-cell volume in the minipig, and based on the increased number of islets, neogenesis of islets is an important factor in expansion of beta-cell mass in this species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Measurement of beta-cell function as an estimate of beta-cell mass is, at present, the only method possible in humans, and this approach has been validated using lean and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> minipigs with a range of beta-cell mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The effects on beta-cell function and mass of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> of longer duration and/or more pronounced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> remains to be determined, but the models developed so far represent a valuable tool for such investigations </plain></SENT>
