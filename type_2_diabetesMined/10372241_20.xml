<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine whether Konjac-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="28808">mannan</z:chebi> (KJM) fiber improves metabolic control as measured by glycemia, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020473" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lipidemia</z:e>, and blood pressure in high-risk type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 11 hyperlipidemic and hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients treated conventionally by a low-fat diet and drug therapy participated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After an 8-week baseline, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were randomly assigned to take either KJM fiber-enriched test biscuits (0.7 g/412 kJ [100 kcal] of glucomannan) or matched placebo wheat bran fiber biscuits during two 3-week treatment phases separated by a 2-week washout period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diet in either case was metabolically controlled and conformed to National Cholesterol Education Program Step 2 guidelines, while medications were maintained constant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Efficacy measures included serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24103">fructosamine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profiles, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoproteins</z:chebi>, blood pressure, body weight, and nutritional analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with placebo, KJM significantly reduced the metabolic control primary end points: serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24103">fructosamine</z:chebi> (5.7%, P = 0.007, adjusted alpha = 0.0167), total:<z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> ratio (10%, P = 0.03, adjusted alpha = 0.05), and systolic blood pressure (sBP) (6.9%, P = 0.02, adjusted alpha = 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Secondary end points, including body weight, total, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoproteins</z:chebi> A-1, B, and their ratio, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, and diastolic blood pressure, were not significant after adjustment by the Bonferroni-Hochberg procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: KJM fiber added to conventional treatment may ameliorate glycemic control, blood <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile, and sBP in high-risk diabetic individuals, possibly improving the effectiveness of conventional treatment in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
