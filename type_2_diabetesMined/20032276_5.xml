<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Aggregate data from two published trials were analyzed to determine the rates and predictors of response to antidepressant pharmacotherapy in adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> using conventional markers of initial treatment outcome (improvement, response, partial remission, and remission) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three hundred eighty-seven patients who received up to 16 weeks of open-label, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase treatment using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3219">bupropion</z:chebi> (n = 93) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9123">sertraline</z:chebi> (n = 294) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of poor treatment outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Candidate predictors included age, race, sex, initial Beck <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Inventory (iBDI) score, treatment received (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="9123">sertraline</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3219">bupropion</z:chebi>), family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, extant <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> complications (eDC), and A1C level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS Of 387 patients initiated on treatment, 330 (85.3%) met criteria for improvement, 232 (59.9%) for response, 207 (53.5%) for partial remission, and 179 (46.3%) for full remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant independent predictors of poor outcome included eDC (for no improvement); <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9123">sertraline</z:chebi> treatment, eDC, and younger age (for nonresponse); <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9123">sertraline</z:chebi> treatment, eDC, and higher iBDI (for failure to partially remit); and younger age and higher iBDI (for failure to fully remit) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Higher pain scores predicted three of the four markers of poor outcome in the subset with pain data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS In patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, poor initial response to antidepressant medication is predicted by multiple factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Auxiliary treatment of pain and impairment may be required to achieve better outcomes </plain></SENT>
