<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is, however, continuing uncertainty about its impact on macrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of these analyses was to generate more precise estimates of the effects of more-intensive, compared with less-intensive, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control on the risk of major cardiovascular events amongst patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A prospectively planned group-level meta-analysis in which characteristics of trials to be included, outcomes of interest, analyses and subgroup definitions were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> pre-specified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 27,049 participants and 2,370 major vascular events contributed to the meta-analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Allocation to more-intensive, compared with less-intensive, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events by 9% (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.84-0.99), primarily because of a 15% reduced risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.76-0.94) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mortality was not decreased, with non-significant HRs of 1.04 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality (95% CI 0.90-1.20) and 1.10 for cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (95% CI 0.84-1.42) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intensively treated participants had significantly more major hypoglycaemic events (HR 2.48, 95% CI 1.91-3.21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Exploratory subgroup analyses suggested the possibility of a differential effect for major cardiovascular events in participants with and without macrovascular disease (HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.89-1.13, vs HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.74-0.94, respectively; interaction p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Targeting more-intensive <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> lowering modestly reduced major macrovascular events and increased major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> over 4.4 years in persons with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The analyses suggest that <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering regimens should be tailored to the individual </plain></SENT>
