<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study examined the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> in 2131 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> attending a Beijing hospital for the first time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The median age of patients was 58 years (IQR 50-65) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The overall prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> was 27.3% (95% CI: 25.4-29.2) and for proliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> 7.8% (95% CI: 6.7-8.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were considered together, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (OR=1.8; P=0.001) and albumin excretion rate (OR=1.5; P=0.019) were independent risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blue-collar occupation (OR=1.5; P=0.047) and blood pressure (OR=1.2; P=0.021) were additional risk factors for non-proliferative and proliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Amongst the 773 newly diagnosed patients, 21% (95% CI: 17.8-23.6) already had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median age of those patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> at diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 3 years higher that those without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, and blue-collar workers (OR=2.2; P=0.012) as well as female gender were particularly at risk (OR=2.0; P=0.033) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a strong correlation between duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (r=0.95; P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By extrapolation, it could be estimated that some degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> might have been present for more than 20 years before <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings emphasise the importance of earlier diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and its complications, especially in socially disadvantaged groups </plain></SENT>
