<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to define the role of insulin secretion and proinsulin processing in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> regulation in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> youth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed hyperglycemic clamps to assess insulin secretion, applying a model of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion to the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> concentration data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> youth with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (NGT), 22 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT), and 10 with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The three groups had comparable anthropometric measures and insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> sensitivity of first-phase secretion showed a significant stepwise decline from NGT to IGT and from IGT to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> sensitivity of second-phase secretion was similar in NGT and IGT subjects yet was significantly lower in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Proinsulin-to-insulin ratios were comparable during first- and second-phase secretion between subjects with NGT and IGT and were significantly increased in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>Obese</z:mp> youth with IGT have a significant defect in first-phase insulin secretion, while a defect in second-phase secretion and proinsulin processing is specific for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in this age-group </plain></SENT>
