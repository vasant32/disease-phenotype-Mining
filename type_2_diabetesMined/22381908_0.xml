<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several studies have shown that improved glycemic control measured by glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (A1c) in patients with type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> results in a reduction of both the micro- and macrovascular complications associated with the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The recent introduction of new oral medications, insulin analogs (long and rapid acting), insulin pens and pumps, better SMBG meters and continuous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring (CGM) have <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> resulted in improvement of glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Closed-loop devices currently in development aim to integrate the CGM and pump system in order to more closely mimic the human pancreas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The other upcoming new basal insulin (Degludec), prandial insulin, other new technologies and improved oral therapies will significantly improve patient acceptance of intensive therapy, glycemic control and quality of life in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
