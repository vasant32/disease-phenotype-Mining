<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of age, overweight and physical activity on the risk of LADA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analysed age, overweight and physical inactivity and the incidence of LADA in 38,800 men and women, observed between 1984 and 1986 and 1995 and 1997 as part of the Nord-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Tr</z:e>Ã¸ndelag Health Survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also compared such factors with incident cases of type 2 (n = 738) and 'classic' type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients classified as LADA (n = 81) had antibodies against GAD and were insulin independent at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The proportion of those who were older, overweight and inactive before diagnosis was almost identical in LADA and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BMI &gt;or=30 kg/m(2) was strongly associated with LADA incidence (relative risk [RR] = 15.0, 95% CI 7.51-29.97) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The association was similar for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (RR = 15.37, 95% CI 12.07-19.57) but not for type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similarly, age (&gt;or=60 years) was an important risk factor for LADA (RR = 5.62, 95% CI 2.36-13.4) as well as for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (RR = 6.78, 95% CI 5.07-9.06) in contrast to type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Physical inactivity was associated with an increased risk of both LADA and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: This study suggests that increased age, overweight and physical inactivity are as strong risk factors for LADA as for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest a role for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in the pathogenesis of LADA </plain></SENT>
