<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated whether the presence of cardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0259749" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autonomic neuropathy</z:e> (CAN) at baseline modified the effect of intensive compared with standard glycemia treatment on mortality outcomes in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> (ACCORD) trial participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: CAN was assessed by measures of heart rate variability (HRV) and QT index (QTI) computed from 10-s resting electrocardiograms in 8,135 ACCORD trial participants with valid measurements (mean age 63.0 years, 40% women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prespecified CAN definitions included a composite of the lowest quartile of HRV and highest QTI quartile in the presence or absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Outcomes were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Associations between CAN and mortality were evaluated by proportional hazards analysis, adjusting for treatment group allocation, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> history, and multiple prespecified baseline covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During a mean 3.5 years follow-up, there were 329 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In fully adjusted analyses, participants with baseline CAN were 1.55-2.14 times as likely to die as participants without CAN, depending on the CAN definition used (P &lt; 0.02 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The effect of allocation to the intensive group on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> mortality was similar in participants with or without CAN at baseline (P(interaction) &gt; 0.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Whereas CAN was associated with increased mortality in this high-risk type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> cohort, these analyses indicate that participants with CAN at baseline had similar mortality outcomes from intensive compared with standard glycemia treatment in the ACCORD cohort </plain></SENT>
