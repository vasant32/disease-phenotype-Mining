<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that the induction of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase (HO)-1 and increased HO activity, which induces arterial antioxidative enzymes and vasoprotection in a mouse and a rat model of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, would ameliorate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the ob mouse model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Lean and ob mice were intraperitoneally administered the HO-1 inducer <z:chebi fb="240" ids="27638">cobalt</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15430">protoporphyrin</z:chebi> (3 mg/kg CoPP) with and without the HO inhibitor stannous mesoporphyrin (2 mg/100 g SnMP) once a week for 6 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Body weight, blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and serum cytokines and adiponectin were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Aorta, adipose tissue, bone marrow, and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were isolated and assessed for HO expression and adipogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HO activity was reduced in ob mice compared with age-matched lean mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Administration of CoPP caused a sustained increase in HO-1 protein, prevented <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>, decreased visceral and subcutaneous fat content (P &lt; 0.03 and 0.01, respectively, compared with vehicle animals), increased serum adiponectin, and decreased plasma <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-1beta levels (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HO-1 induction improved insulin sensitivity and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance and decreased insulin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Upregulation of HO-1 decreased adipogenesis in bone marrow in vivo and in cultured MSCs and <z:mp ids='MP_0004892'>increased adiponectin levels</z:mp> in the culture media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of HO activity decreased adiponectin and increased secretion of TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1beta levels in ob mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study provides strong evidence for the existence of an HO-1-adiponectin regulatory axis that can be manipulated to ameliorate the deleterious effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
