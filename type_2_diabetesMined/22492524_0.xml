<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In recent decades, the antihyperglycemic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3095">biguanide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> has been used extensively in the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, despite continuing uncertainty over its direct target </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this article, using two independent approaches, we demonstrate that cellular actions of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> are disrupted by interference with its metal-binding properties, which have been known for over a century but little studied by biologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that copper sequestration opposes known actions of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> not only on <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent signaling, but also on S6 protein phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="3095">Biguanide</z:chebi>/metal interactions are stabilized by extensive Ï€-electron delocalization and by investigating analogs of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>; we provide evidence that this intrinsic property enables <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3095">biguanides</z:chebi> to regulate AMPK, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production, gluconeogenic gene expression, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> respiration, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> copper binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, regulation of S6 phosphorylation is prevented only by direct modification of the metal-liganding groups of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3095">biguanide</z:chebi> structure, supporting recent data that AMPK and S6 phosphorylation are regulated independently by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3095">biguanides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additional studies with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> copper is targeted by both of these clinically important drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Together, these results suggest that cellular effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3095">biguanides</z:chebi> depend on their metal-binding properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This link may illuminate a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms enabling antihyperglycemic drug action </plain></SENT>
