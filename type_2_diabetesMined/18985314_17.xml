<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients aged 30-74 years with no previous CHD or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (N = 13,087) were followed for a mean of 5.6 years until 2003 for fatal or non-fatal CHD, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (CHD or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) and total mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In total, 1,922 cardiovascular-disease events occurred, based on 64,864 person-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The relative risks of CHD, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> and total mortality for a 5 unit increase in BMI at baseline were 15%, 11%, 13% and 27%, respectively, using Cox regression analysis, after adjusting for age, sex, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration, hypoglycaemic treatment and smoking (model 1), and were 9%, 4% (not significant), 7% and 20%, respectively, when adjusting also for HbA(1c), blood pressure, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive drugs</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-reducing drugs and <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> (model 2) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significant hazard ratios were attenuated when adjusted according to model 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For a 1 unit increase in BMI during follow-up, the relative risk of CHD (model 2) was 1.13 (1.04-1.23; p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Both overweight and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> independently increased the risk of CHD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The CHD risk was higher with increasing BMI than with stable or decreasing BMI during the study </plain></SENT>
