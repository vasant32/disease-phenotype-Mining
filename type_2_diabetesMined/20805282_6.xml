<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Disposition index (DI) and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> effectiveness (S(G)) are risk factors for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the effect of DI and S(G) on future <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> has not been examined in large epidemiological studies using direct measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Insulin sensitivity index (S(I)), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin response (AIR), and S(G) were measured in 826 participants (aged 40-69 years) in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin Resistance</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Study (IRAS) by the frequently sampled intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DI was expressed as S(I) x AIR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the 5-year follow-up examination, 128 individuals (15.5%) had developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of a model with S(I) and AIR was similar to that of DI (0.767 vs. 0.774, P = 0.543) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate logistic regression model that included both DI and S(G), conversion to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was predicted by both S(G) (odds ratio x 1 SD, 0.61 [0.47-0.80]) and DI (0.68 [0.54-0.85]) after adjusting for demographic variables, fasting and 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations, family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and measures of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Age, sex, race/ethnicity, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance status, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> did not have a significant modifying impact on the relation of S(G) and DI to incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The predictive power of DI is comparable to that of its components, S(I) and AIR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>S(G) and DI independently predict conversion to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> similarly across race/ethnic groups, varying states of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
