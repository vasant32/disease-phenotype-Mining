<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe the use of insulin pump therapy in women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> mellitus (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e>) or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in pregnancy and persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> despite multiple injections of subcutaneous insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: As part of a service audit, deliveries to women with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at a single South Auckland hospital were reviewed from 1991 through 1994 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Glycemic control was estimated by the mean of self-recorded and laboratory postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a nested case-control study, pregnancies complicated by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e>/type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with use of an insulin pump were compared with those without insulin pump therapy and peak insulin requirements of 100-199 units/ day, matched for ethnicity and type of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 30 of 251 Polynesian, European, and South Asian women with singleton pregnancies complicated by insulin-requiring <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e>/type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> used an insulin pump </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An additional two women with high insulin requirements discontinued pump therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of the women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e>/type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> experienced severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>, whereas 79% of the women had improved glycemic control within 1-4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mothers using a pump had greater insulin requirements (median maximum 246 vs. 130 units per day) and greater <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> (10.6 vs. 5.0 kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Their babies were more likely to be admitted to the Special Care Baby Unit but were neither significantly heavier nor experienced greater <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> than control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Insulin pump therapy seems to be safe and effective for maintaining glycemic control in pregnancies complicated by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e>/type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and requiring large doses of insulin </plain></SENT>
