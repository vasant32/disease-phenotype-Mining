<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Adiponectin may improve insulin sensitivity, reduce <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, and ameliorate glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, few studies have evaluated dietary predictors of plasma adiponectin levels, especially among subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: To examine the associations of dietary glycemic load, glycemic index, and fibers with plasma adiponectin levels, we conducted a cross-sectional analysis in 780 diabetic men from the Health Professionals' Follow-up Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dietary information was obtained in 1986, 1990, and 1994 using semiquantitative food-frequency questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After adjustment for age, BMI, smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, aspirin use, HbA(1c), history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo>, and fiber intake, dietary glycemic index and glycemic load were inversely associated with plasma adiponectin in a dose-dependent fashion (P for trend = 0.005 for glycemic index and 0.004 for glycemic load) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adiponectin levels were 13% lower in the highest quintile of dietary glycemic index than in the lowest quintile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For dietary glycemic load, adiponectin levels were 18% lower in the highest quintile than in the lowest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, high intake of cereal fiber was associated with increased plasma adiponectin levels, adjusting for lifestyle factors and dietary glycemic load (P for trend = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adiponectin levels were 19% higher in the highest quintile than in the lowest quintile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Higher <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> intake was also associated with increased plasma adiponectin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Diets low in glycemic load and high in fiber may increase plasma adiponectin concentrations in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
