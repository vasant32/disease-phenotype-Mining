<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to investigate the plasma visfatin levels in patients with newly diagnosed and untreated type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT), who had no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients with T2DM, 18 subjects with IGT and 40 healthy controls were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Visfatin levels were measured along with the BMI, blood pressure, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, adiponectin and hsCRP levels, and HOMA-IR indexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Age, sex and BMI were similar in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Visfatin levels were higher in the diabetic group than the controls (p=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the visfatin levels between the T2DM and IGT groups as well as IGT group and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasma visfatin concentrations did not differ between men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Visfatin levels did not correlate with BMI, blood pressure, plasma adiponectin, insulin, hsCRP, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels or HOMA-IR indexes in the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> causes an increase in plasma visfatin levels and, as in people with T2DM but not with IGT, this increase gets more prominent as the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> worsens </plain></SENT>
