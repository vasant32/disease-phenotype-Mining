<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 21 subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were enrolled in this double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study (vitamin E, 11 patients; placebo, 10 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomly assigned to receive either 900 mg vitamin E or placebo for 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The average dietary vitamin E consumption of the subjects was similar during the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The main outcome measure was the electrophysiological tests assessing nerve conduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, HbA1, postprandial plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and electrophysiological parameters in the basal state and after 6 months of treatment were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Glycemic indexes did not show any significant changes during the study, whereas nerve conduction improved significantly in 2 of the 12 studied electrophysiological parameters after 6 months in patients on vitamin E supplementation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The changes in the electrophysiological parameters were obvious in the median motor nerve fibers and tibial motor nerve fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nerve conduction velocity in the median motor nerve fibers (P = 0.0019) and tibial motor nerve distal latency (P = 0.0284) improved significantly after 6 months of vitamin E supplementation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that defective nerve conduction in diabetic subjects with mild-to-moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> may be improved by pharmacological doses of vitamin E supplementation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies with a larger number of patients for longer periods of time are needed </plain></SENT>
