<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the combined use of these two biomarkers in predicting the deterioration of glycaemia in a prospective study after a median of 5.4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In total 1,288 non-diabetic participants from the Hong Kong <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cardiovascular Risk Factor</z:e> Prevalence Study-2, with high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) and total adiponectin levels measured were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OGTT was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two hundred and six participants had deterioration of glycaemia at follow-up, whereas 1,082 participants did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Baseline age, hsCRP and adiponectin levels were significant independent predictors of the deterioration of glycaemia in a Cox regression analysis after adjusting for baseline age, sex, BMI, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triacylglycerols</z:chebi>, 2 h post-OGTT <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> index (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The introduction of hsCRP or adiponectin level to a regression model including the other biomarker improved the prediction of glycaemic progression significantly in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants, especially in women (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The combined inclusion of the two biomarkers resulted in a modest improvement in model discrimination, compared with the inclusion of either one alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among participants with impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IFG/IGT) at baseline, hsCRP and adiponectin levels were not predictive of progression or improvement of glycaemic status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Adiponectin and hsCRP levels are independent factors in predicting the deterioration of glycaemia, supporting the role of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e>-related <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Their combined use as predictive biomarkers is especially useful in women, but not in participants with IFG/IGT </plain></SENT>
