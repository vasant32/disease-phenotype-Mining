<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We thus investigated if meal-induced platelet activation could be attenuated by meal insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A randomized, double-blind, cross-over study was performed to compare postprandial platelet activation after premeal injections of placebo or insulin aspart (0.1 and 0.2 units/kg) in 18 patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Platelet activation was assessed by flow cytometry, without and with stimulation by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26995">thromboxane</z:chebi> analog U46619 or <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Measurements were before and after premeal blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> standardization (to 6-7 mmol/L by insulin infusion, if needed) and at 90 min after the meal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Premeal insulin reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011998'>postprandial hyperglycemia</z:hpo> by 2-3 mmol/L compared with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Postmeal insulin levels were doubled with placebo and further elevated with insulin injections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The standardized meal enhanced U46619-induced platelet P-selectin expression by 23% after placebo; this response was more than doubled after premeal insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>U46619-induced fibrinogen binding was unchanged after meal intake with placebo but was markedly enhanced (by ~50-60%) after premeal insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postprandial platelet activation correlated positively to postprandial insulin levels and inversely to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Premeal insulin infusion was also associated with platelet activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that postprandial insulin rather than <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> accounts for postprandial platelet activation in T2DM patients </plain></SENT>
