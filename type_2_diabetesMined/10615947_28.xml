<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In light of an occurring growth of elderly people affected by type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and recent observations indicating that type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may be a disease of the innate immune system, we evaluated whether signs of islet cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> are associated with an abnormal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control, the presence of insulin requirement, or an activation of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase response in older individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>GAD65 and IA-2 autoantibodies along with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase response markers fibrinogen and C-reactive protein were tested in 196 serum samples from patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and in 94 nondiabetic control subjects over the age of 65 years from the Pittsburgh cohort of the Cardiovascular Health Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the diabetic patients, 12% (24 of 196) had autoantibodies against GAD65 and/or IA-2, a prevalence significantly higher than that found in nondiabetic individuals (1 of 94, 1.1%; P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Type 2 diabetic patients who were positive for GAD65 and/or IA-2 autoantibodies (Ab+), as compared with those negative for these autoantibodies (Ab-), had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0004924'>abnormal oral glucose tolerance</z:hpo> test (OGTT) (P = 0.03) before and a higher frequency of oral hypoglycemic treatment (P = 0.003) at the time of autoantibody testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No differences were seen in the percentage of insulin requirement in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a statistically significant increase in fibrinogen (P = 0.005) and C-reactive protein levels (P = 0.025) was found in type 2 diabetic patients with high levels of GAD65 and/or IA-2 autoantibodies as compared with Ab-patients and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, in type 2 diabetic subjects &gt; or =65 years old, the presence of islet cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> is associated with an impairment of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase insulin secretion, as revealed by an OGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A pronounced activation of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase response, found to be associated with islet cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo>, may in part explain this defect in insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings not only have direct implications for adequate classification and treatment of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the elderly, but also for understanding the autoimmune/inflammatory mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
