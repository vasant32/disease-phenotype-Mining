<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate how signs and symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> correlated with defects in motor and sensory nerve conduction velocity (MCV and SCV) and sensory perception thresholds in patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MCV and SCV in peroneal and sural nerves and vibratory, warm and cold perception thresholds (VPT, WPT, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>) were evaluated in the lower limbs of 127 patients (42+/-7.9 years old, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 16+/-11 years and HbA1c, 7.7+/-1.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results were compared with clinical findings (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> impairment assessment, NIA) and sensory symptoms (neurological symptom assessment, NSA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sensory symptoms were present in 24% of patients, 91% had at least one abnormal finding in the neurological examination and 84% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000762'>abnormal nerve conduction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The greatest deviation from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> was observed for <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi> on the dorsum of the foot and peroneal MCV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>NIA and NSA correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> electrophysiological measurements in the foot and big toe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that clinical findings correlate well with electrophysiological abnormalities in patients with type 1 diabetic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An elevated <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi> for the foot was the most pronounced sensory defect </plain></SENT>
