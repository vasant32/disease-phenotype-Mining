<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine whether changes characteristic of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> occur in two rat models with spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The frontal cortices of 8-month-diabetic rats were examined with respect to neuronal densities, neurite degeneration, expression, and/or immunolocalization of amyloid precursor protein (APP), beta-secretase, beta-amyloid, COOH-terminal fragment (CTF), insulin receptor, IGF-1 receptor, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase kinase 3-beta (GSK-3beta), protein kinase B (Akt), phosphorylated tau (phospho-tau), synaptophysin, and phosphorylated neurofilaments (SMI-31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>Neuronal loss</z:hpo> occurred in both models, significantly more so in type 2 diabetic BBZDR/Wor rats compared with type 1 diabetic BB/Wor rats and was associated with a ninefold increase of dystrophic neurites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>APP, beta-secretase, beta-amyloid, and CTF were significantly increased in type 2 diabetic rats, as was phospho-tau </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The insulin receptor expression was decreased in type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, whereas IGF-1 receptor was decreased in both models, as were Akt and GSK-3beta expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The data show that beta-amyloid and phospho-tau accumulation occur in experimental <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and that this is associated with neurite degeneration and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The changes were more severe in the type 2 diabetic model and appear to be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and possibly <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The two models will provide useful tools to unravel further mechanistic associations between <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
