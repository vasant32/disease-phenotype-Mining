<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine whether a potential marker for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (family history) is related to CAD in type 1 diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The two major types of primary <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, type 1 and type 2, are both associated with an increased risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the etiology and associated risk factors may differ by type of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, CAD is likely to be linked with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> associated with the type 2 "process," while CAD in type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> has, so far, been more closely linked to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because the etiologies of type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are different, it is possible that some CAD in type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may be related to the coexistence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility (i.e., <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We evaluated the interrelationships between family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> &gt; 30 years, no insulin for 1st year) and presence of CAD in a cohort of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011463'>childhood-onset</z:hpo> type 1 diabetic subjects using the Pittsburgh Epidemiology of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Complications study (n = 658) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A first-degree family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was reported in 112 subjects, and CAD was present in 119 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Those subjects reporting a family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were significantly older, had a longer duration of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, had higher <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> levels, and had a borderline significantly increased Beck <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> inventory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sex differences in CAD risk factors were also noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Using logistic regression analysis, the odds ratio (95% CI) for the presence of CAD in association with a family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002057'>NIDDM</z:mp> was 1.89 (1.27-2.84) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio (95% CI) after adjusting for disease duration, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, Beck <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> status was 1.45 (0.87-2.28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that a family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is a risk factor for CAD in type 1 diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This supports the concept that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> may contribute to development of CAD in type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
