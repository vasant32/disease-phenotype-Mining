<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system dysfunction, estimated by slow heart rate recovery (HRR) following cessation of an exercise treadmill test, was associated with increases in insulin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> over time and the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Maximal exercise tests were performed by 3295 healthy adults aged 18-30 years in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Repeat measurements of insulin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> collected at 7-, 10-, and 15-year examinations were compared by quartiles of HRR (maximum heart rate minus heart rate 2 min after cessation of the test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was identified at any follow-up examination as <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &gt;or=7 mmol/l or the use of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> control medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among participants who did not develop <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, fasting insulin concentrations increased from baseline to year 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Following adjustment (for age, race, sex, smoking status, and BMI), participants with the slowest HRR (quartile 1) had higher fasting insulin at each examination than participants with faster HRR (e.g., year 15 examination: 88.1 vs. 81.3 pmol/l for quartile 1 vs. quartile 4, respectively, P = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> did not differ by quartile of HRR at any examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among participants with poor fitness, the risk of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 98) was 3.4-fold greater (95% CI 1.5-8.0) when HRR was &lt;42 vs. &gt;42 bpm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This persisted following adjustment for baseline insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002459'>Autonomic dysfunction</z:hpo>, in combination with poor physical fitness, may be a mechanism associated with early <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> dysmetabolism and the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
