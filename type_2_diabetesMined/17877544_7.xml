<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Activities of the dominant incretins, glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent insulinotropic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, include <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent stimulation of insulin secretion and, in preclinical models, improvement in islet beta-cell mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>GLP-1 additionally reduces glucagon secretion, inhibits gastric emptying and promotes satiety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) exhibit reduced total and intact GLP-1 levels, and exogenous administration of the hormone via continuous infusion results in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> profiles similar to those in non-diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Incretins are rapidly degraded by dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, strategies to enhance incretin activity have included development of GLP-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> resistant to the action of DPP-4 (e.g. exenatide and liraglutide) and DPP-4 inhibitors that act to increase concentrations of endogenous intact incretins (e.g. <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> and vildagliptin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical trials of these incretin-based therapies have shown them to be effective in improving glycaemic control in patients with T2DM </plain></SENT>
