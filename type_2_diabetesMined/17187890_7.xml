<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 4757 subjects age &gt;/=20 years both male and female were enrolled randomly in a cross-sectional study in 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The same area and population was reinvestigated in 2004 following the same selection procedure, on a sample of 3981 individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Structural and economical changes were noted for the last 5 years in the locality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An increased prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was found with 6.8% in the present survey compared with 2.3% in the earlier survey (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Age, BMI and systolic blood pressure were found to be significant risk factors following both for FBG and for OGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>WHR was found to be a significant risk factor for men only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A substantial agreement was observed between FBG and OGTT (kappa 0.63) compared to the previous investigation in 1999 (kappa 0.40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Differences in the indices of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, that is BMI, WHR and waist girth, may in part explain the increased prevalence, which in turn may explain due to fast-expanded urbanization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The state of affairs warrants immediate measures necessary to prevent the epidemic particularly in the localities that are in the transition phase from rural to semi-urban facilities </plain></SENT>
