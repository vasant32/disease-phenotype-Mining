<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> control and comorbidity, taking into account <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> comorbidities and their severity, in a primary care setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a retrospective descriptive study based on chart review of 96 randomly selected type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Comorbidity was measured with the cumulative illness rating scale (CIRS), an exhaustive comorbidity index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> was considered as controlled if the mean value of two measurements of glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A (HbA(1c)) was less than 7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Taking <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> control as the dependent variable, its relationship with the CIRS score, age, sex, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related complications was explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> control was not significantly related with the CIRS score, age, sex or <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> duration was the only variable significantly related to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests that comorbidity measured with the CIRS in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is not a factor that prevents the achievement of a good glycemia control </plain></SENT>
