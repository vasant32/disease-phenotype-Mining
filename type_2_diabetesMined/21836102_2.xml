<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether subjects who are nonobese FDRs show signs of low-grade <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> before or after exposure to short-term physical inactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 13 healthy FDR subjects and 20 control (CON) subjects matched for age, sex, and BMI before and after 10 days of bed rest (BR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity was measured by the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Key low-grade <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> mediators were measured in arterial blood and microdialysate from subcutaneous abdominal (SCAAT) and femoral adipose tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adipokine <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was determined in SCAAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Before BR, FDR subjects displayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, elevated plasma C-reactive protein, leptin, and monocyte chemoattractant protein (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>)-1, high interleukin (IL)-6, and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 expressions, as well as low adiponectin and leptin expressions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FDR subjects responded to BR by decreasing plasma adiponectin and IL-10 expression and increasing plasma expression of IL-10 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-Î± </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, CON subjects responded to BR by increasing plasma adiponectin and adiponectin expression and by decreasing SCAAT microdialysate leptin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Young and nonobese FDR of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> exhibit low-grade <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, which is further and disproportionately aggravated when exposed to physical inactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The study provides support for the notion that people at increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> should avoid even short periods of physical inactivity </plain></SENT>
