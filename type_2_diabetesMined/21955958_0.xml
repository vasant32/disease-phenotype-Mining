<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten healthy men and 10 men with T2D received mixed and liquid meals after an overnight fast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Classical (insulinogenic index; insulin/<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> areas under curves, AUC(insulin)/AUC(<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>)) and model-based (beta-cell <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> sensitivity; rate sensitivity; potentiation factor ratio, PFR) beta-cell function estimates were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Between-meal differences in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> (TG), beta-cell function and oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> insulin sensitivity (OGIS) and between-meal correlations for beta-cell function and OGIS were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among healthy subjects, beta-cell function and OGIS were similar between meals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (p=0.03), insulin (p=0.002), AUC(insulin)/AUC(<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>) (p=0.004) and insulin secretion (p=0.04) were higher after the liquid meal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among T2D subjects, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, beta-cell function, and OGIS were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PFR was higher (p=0.004) and TG increased more slowly (p=0.002) after the liquid meal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>OGIS and beta-cell function were correlated during both meals in both groups (r=0.66-0.98), except incremental AUC(insulin)/AUC(<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>), rate sensitivity, and, in healthy subjects, PFR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Metabolic responses after mixed or liquid meals of similar content were highly correlated in T2D and healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In T2D, the liquid meal produced beta-cell function estimates generally similar to the mixed meal </plain></SENT>
