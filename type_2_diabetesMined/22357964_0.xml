<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>11β-HSD1 inhibition enhances insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30762">salicylates</z:chebi> downregulate 11β-HSD1 expression, contributing to their metabolic efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We treated diet-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (DIO) 11β-HSD1-deficient mice and C57Bl/6 mice with <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30762">salicylate</z:chebi> for 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> tolerance was assessed in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Tissue transcript levels were assessed by quantitative PCR and enzyme activity by incubation with (3)H-steroid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two weeks' administration of salsalate was also investigated in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study in 16 men, with measurement of liver 11β-HSD1 activity in vivo and adipose tissue 11β-HSD1 transcript levels ex vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In C57Bl/6 DIO mice, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30762">salicylate</z:chebi> <z:mp ids='MP_0005292'>improved glucose tolerance</z:mp> and downregulated 11β-HSD1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and activity selectively in visceral adipose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DIO 11β-HSD1-deficient mice were resistant to these metabolic effects of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30762">salicylate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In men, salsalate reduced 11β-HSD1 expression in subcutaneous adipose, and in vitro <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30762">salicylate</z:chebi> treatment reduced adipocyte 11β-HSD1 expression and induced adiponectin expression only in the presence of 11β-HSD1 substrate </plain></SENT>
