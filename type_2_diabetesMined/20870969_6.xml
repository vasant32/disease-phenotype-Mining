<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess whether recently discovered genetic loci associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> also predict long-term changes in glycemic traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Sixteen fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-raising loci were genotyped in middle-aged adults from the Gene x Lifestyle interactions And Complex traits Involved in Elevated disease Risk (GLACIER) Study, a population-based prospective cohort study from northern Sweden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genotypes were tested for association with baseline fasting and 2-h postchallenge glycemia (N = 16,330), and for changes in these glycemic traits during a 10-year follow-up period (N = 4,059) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cross-sectional directionally consistent replication with fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations was achieved for 12 of 16 variants; 10 variants were also associated with impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (IFG) and 7 were independently associated with 2-h postchallenge <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In prospective analyses, the effect alleles at four loci (GCK rs4607517, ADRA2A rs10885122, DGKB-TMEM195 rs2191349, and G6PC2 rs560887) were nominally associated with worsening fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations during 10-years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MTNR1B rs10830963, which was predictive of elevated fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations in cross-sectional analyses, was associated with a protective effect on postchallenge <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations during follow-up; however, this was only when baseline fasting and 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucoses</z:chebi> were adjusted for </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An additive effect of multiple risk alleles on glycemic traits was observed: a weighted genetic risk score (80th vs. 20th centiles) was associated with a 0.16 mmol/l (P = 2.4 × 10⁻⁶) greater elevation in fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and a 64% (95% CI: 33-201%) higher risk of developing IFG during 10 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings imply that genetic profiling might facilitate the early detection of persons who are genetically susceptible to deteriorating <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control; studies of incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and discrete cardiovascular end points will help establish whether the magnitude of these changes is clinically relevant </plain></SENT>
