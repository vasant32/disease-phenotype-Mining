<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a review of the literature to select articles that performed a cost-benefit analysis for 17 widely practiced interventions for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A scale for categorizing interventions according to their economic impact was defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 17 interventions were classified as follows: 1) clearly cost-saving, 2) clearly cost-effective, 3) possibly cost-effective, 4) non-cost-effective, or 5) unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clearly cost-saving interventions included eye care and pre-conception care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clearly cost-effective interventions included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> prevention in type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and improved glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Possibly cost-effective interventions included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> prevention in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and self-management training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Non-cost-effective interventions were not identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interventions with unclear economic impact included case management, medical nutrition therapy, self-monitoring of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, foot care, blood pressure control, blood <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> control, smoking cessation, exercise, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, HbA1c measurement, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021400" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FLU">influenza</z:e> vaccination, and pneumococcus vaccination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Widely practiced interventions for patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> can be clearly cost-saving and clearly cost-effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These practices are attractive from both a medical and an economic perspective </plain></SENT>
