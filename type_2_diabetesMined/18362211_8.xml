<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Large sensory axons innervating muscle spindles provide feedback for balance and gait and, when damaged, can cause altered sensorimotor function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to determine whether symptoms of large-fiber DPN in type 1 and type 2 diabetic mouse models are related to alterations in muscle spindle innervation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, diabetic mice were treated with insulin to assess whether sensorimotor and spindle deficits were reversible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Behavioral assessments were performed in untreated and treated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> (STZ)-injected C57BL/6 mice to quantitate <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-induced deficits in balance and gait </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Quantification of Ia axon innervation of spindles was carried out using immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy on STZ-injected C57BL/6 and db/db mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: STZ-injected C57BL/6 mice displayed significant and progressive sensorimotor dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis of Ia innervation patterns of diabetic C57BL/6 spindles revealed a range of abnormalities suggestive of Ia <z:mp ids='MP_0005405'>axon degeneration</z:mp> and/or regeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The multiple abnormal Ia fiber <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphologies</z:mp> resulted in substantial variability in axonal width and inter-rotational distance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IRD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Likewise, db/db mice displayed significant variability in their <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IRDs</z:e> compared with db(+) mice, suggesting that damage to Ia axons occurs in both type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Insulin treatment improved behavioral deficits and restored Ia fiber innervation in comparison with nondiabetic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Similar to small fibers, Ia axons are vulnerable to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and their damage may contribute to balance and gait deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In addition, these studies provide a novel method to assay therapeutic interventions designed for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-induced large-fiber dysfunction </plain></SENT>
