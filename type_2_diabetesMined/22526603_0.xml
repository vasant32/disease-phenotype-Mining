<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The InterAct case-cohort study consists of 12,403 incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> cases and a randomly selected subcohort of 16,154 individuals, drawn from a total cohort of 340,234 participants with 3.99 million person-years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Physical activity was assessed by a four-category index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> was measured by BMI and waist circumference (WC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Associations between physical activity, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and case-ascertained incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were analysed by Cox regression after adjusting for educational level, smoking status, alcohol consumption and energy intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In combined analyses, individuals were stratified according to physical activity level, BMI and WC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A one-category difference in physical activity (equivalent to approximately 460 and 365 kJ/day in men and women, respectively) was independently associated with a 13% (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.80, 0.94) and 7% (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.89, 0.98) relative reduction in the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in men and women, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lower levels of physical activity were associated with an increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> strata of BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Comparing inactive with active individuals, the HRs were 1.44 (95% CI 1.11, 1.87) and 1.38 (95% CI 1.17, 1.62) in abdominally lean and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> inactive men, respectively, and 1.57 (95% CI 1.19, 2.07) and 1.19 (95% CI 1.01, 1.39) in abdominally lean and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> inactive women, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Physical activity is associated with a reduction in the risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> across BMI categories in men and women, as well as in abdominally lean and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> men and women </plain></SENT>
