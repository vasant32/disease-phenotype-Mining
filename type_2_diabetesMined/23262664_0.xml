<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Impaired prohIAPP processing due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta cell dysfunction</z:hpo> is implicated in hIAPP aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined whether the glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 receptor (GLP-1R) <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> exenatide can restore impaired prohIAPP processing and reduce hIAPP aggregation in cultured human islets and preserve beta cell function/mass during culture conditions used in clinical islet transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Isolated human islets (n = 10 donors) were cultured with or without exenatide in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or elevated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> for 2 or 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Beta cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, proliferation, mass, function, cJUN N-terminal kinase (JNK) and protein kinase B (PKB) activation and amyloid formation were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ProhIAPP, its intermediates and mature hIAPP were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Exenatide-treated islets had markedly lower JNK and caspase-3 activation and beta cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, resulting in higher beta/alpha cell ratio and beta cell area than non-treated cultured islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Exenatide improved beta cell function, manifested as higher insulin response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin content, compared with non-treated cultured islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Phospho-PKB immunoreactivity was detectable in exenatide-treated but not untreated cultured islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Islet culture caused impaired prohIAPP processing with decreased mature hIAPP and increased NH(2)-terminally unprocessed prohIAPP levels resulting in higher release of immature hIAPP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Exenatide restored prohIAPP processing and reduced hIAPP aggregation in cultured islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Exenatide treatment enhances survival and function of cultured human islets and restores impaired prohIAPP processing in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and elevated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> conditions thereby reducing hIAPP aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>GLP-1R <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> may preserve beta cells in conditions associated with islet amyloid formation </plain></SENT>
