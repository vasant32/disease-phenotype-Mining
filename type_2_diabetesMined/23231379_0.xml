<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies suggested that this medicine is effective for treating type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This controlled trial evaluated the safety and effectiveness of TM81 in the treatment of type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study was a large-scale controlled clinical trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of TM81 on type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After a 2-week run-in period, 480 overweight type 2 early-stage diabetic patients [35-65 years old, HbA1c ≥ 7.0%, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) 7.0-13.9 mM or 2 h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (PG) &gt; 11.1 mM, body mass index (BMI) ≥ 24 kg/m(2) ] were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These patients were divided into a TM81 group and placebo group in a 3 : 1 ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The subjects received 6 g TM81 or placebo, three times daily for 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After treatment, the HbA1c decrease was 1.02% in the TM81 group versus 0.47% in the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The FPG decreased 0.8 ± 0.1 mM in the TM81 group versus an increase of 0.2 ± 0.2 mM in the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The PG decreased 2.7 ± 0.3 mM in the TM81 group versus a decrease of 0.9 ± 0.4 mM in the placebo group (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The TM81 was more effective for patients with higher baseline HbA1c levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The TM81 group also showed improved β-cell function and increased homeostatic model assessment (HOMA)-β </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In addition, body weight, BMI and waist circumference of subjects in the TM81 group were reduced, and the symptoms related to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the types and frequency of adverse reactions between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The data showed that TM81 is effective in controlling blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level and is safe to use in patients with early-stage type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
