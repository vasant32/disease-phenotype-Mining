<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: We examined the associations between <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnea</z:hpo> in a 57-year-old unselected urban population in Northern Finland, taking into account some determinants of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A population-based health survey was conducted in a population of 555 women and 438 men born in 1945 and living in the city of Oulu in 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> status was determined with a standard 2-h oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sleeping disorders were recorded on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESS</z:e>) and a questionnaire including 5 questions about sleeping and snoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Zung Self-rated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Scale (ZSDS) was used to assess depressive symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression was used in the estimation of odds ratios (OR) for the associations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnea</z:hpo> with the covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>Sleep apnea</z:hpo> was found to be associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (OR 2.56, 95% CI 1.20-5.47) and newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (OR 2.42 95% CI 1.01-5.82), but the estimated association with impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> regulation (IGR) was coupled with a wide margin of error (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.43-1.93) when adjusted for the following covariates: gender, current smoking, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, hs-CRP, physical activity, waist circumference, and Zung <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There seems to be a positive association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnea</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and even with newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but we could not establish an association with IGR </plain></SENT>
