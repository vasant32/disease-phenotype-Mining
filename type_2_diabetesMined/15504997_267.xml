<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a triple-blind, placebo-controlled, 30-week study conducted at 101 sites in the U.S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After a 4-week, single-blind, placebo lead-in period, 377 subjects were randomized (60% men, age 55 +/- 11 years, BMI 33 +/- 6 kg/m(2), HbA(1c) 8.6 +/- 1.2% [+/-SD]) and began 4 weeks at 5 microg subcutaneous exenatide twice daily (before breakfast and dinner; arms A and B) or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, subjects in arm B were escalated to 10 microg b.i.d. exenatide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects continued <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At week 30, HbA(1c) changes from baseline were -0.86 +/- 0.11, -0.46 +/- 0.12, and 0.12 +/- 0.09% (+/-SE) in the 10-microg, 5-microg, and placebo arms, respectively (adjusted P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of evaluable subjects with baseline HbA(1c) &gt; 7% (n = 237), 41% (10 microg), 33% (5 microg), and 9% (placebo) achieved HbA(1c) &lt;or= 7% (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations decreased in the 10-microg arm compared with placebo (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subjects in the exenatide arms had dose-dependent progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, with an end-of-study loss in the 10-microg exenatide arm of -1.6 +/- 0.3 kg from baseline (P &lt; 0.05 vs. placebo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most frequent adverse events were generally mild or moderate and gastrointestinal in nature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Exenatide significantly reduced HbA(1c) in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> failing maximally effective doses of a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Exenatide was generally well tolerated and was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
