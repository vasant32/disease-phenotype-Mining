<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated these in white individuals who were aged 40-79 years and from the population of Bruneck, Italy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of an age- and sex-stratified random sample of 1,000 individuals who were identified in 1990, 919 underwent an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) and an assessment of physiological risk factors for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (homeostasis model assessment, HOMA-IR), and postchallenge insulin response (Sluiter's Index) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> at baseline by fasting or 2-h OGTT plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (World Health Organization criteria, n = 82) was excluded, leaving 837 individuals who were followed for 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Incident cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were ascertained by confirmed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treatment or a fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &gt;or=7.0 mmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At follow-up, 64 individuals had developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, corresponding to a population-standardized incidence rate of 7.6 per 1,000 person-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sex- and age-adjusted incidence rates were elevated 11-fold in individuals with impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> at baseline, 4-fold in those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo>, 3-fold in overweight individuals, 10-fold in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals, and approximately 2-fold in individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Incidence rates increased with increasing HOMA-IR and decreasing Sluiter's Index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> insulin sensitivity and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> insulin response, individuals with low insulin sensitivity and low insulin response had a sevenfold higher risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Baseline impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, BMI, HOMA-IR, and Sluiter's Index were the only independent predictors of incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in multivariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that approximately 1% of European white individuals aged 40-79 years develop type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> annually and that "subdiabetic" <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, and impaired insulin response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> are independent predictors of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
