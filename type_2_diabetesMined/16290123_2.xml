<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the relationship between the efficacy of renin angiotensin system (<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>) inhibitors and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo>, were treated with <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> inhibitors, the first being an <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitor</z:chebi> (ACEI) and the second, an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> (ATII) receptor blocker (ARB) for 8 weeks each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference (except serum ACE activity) between the two treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, by analysis segregated with ACE gene polymorphism, ARB significantly decreased transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta) compared to ACEI in patients with the I/I genotype but not in patients with the D/I+D/D genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DeltaATII and DeltaTGF-beta have a negative correlation with the I/I genotype and a positive correlation with the D/I+D/D genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These correlation coefficients are significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We suggest that in I/I patients, TGF-beta was reduced by ARB via effects on (ATII) type 2 receptors (AT2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In our experiments, the effect of ARB on TGF-beta reduction was only detected by segregation of ACE genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This indicates that the selection of medicine in light of a patient's genotype is important in treating diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
