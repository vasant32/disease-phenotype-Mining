<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the association of these genotypes with DM in Japanese </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eighty-one subjects with DM and 81 non-diabetic subjects (NGT) were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The number of subjects with genotypes UCSNP-43 G/G, G/A and A/A were 76, 5 and 0, respectively, for the DM and NGT groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number of subjects with genotypes UCSNP-44 T/T, T/C and C/C were 66, 14 and 1 for the DM group and 64, 17 and 0 for the NGT group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no difference between the groups in terms of frequency of any genotype combinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No association between the genotypes and DM was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We next examined the differences between the genotypes or genotype combinations in terms of the traits related to DM, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No differences were observed between the genotypes UCSNP43 G/G and G/A, between UCSNP-44 T/T and the others, or between the genotype combination UCSNP-43 G/G and UCSNP-44 T/T and the others, except that the individuals with the genotype combination had significantly increased serum cholesterol levels (212.6 +/- 34.3 vs. 198.5 +/- 29.9, P=0.020) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The genotype combination might be a risk factor, not for DM, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, but for increased serum cholesterol </plain></SENT>
