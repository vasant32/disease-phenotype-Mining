<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Diabetic status and APOE genotype interactions were assessed cross-sectionally for 826 community-dwelling, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-free, non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> individuals (526 non-diabetic non-APOE epsilon4 carriers, 174 non-diabetic APOE epsilon4 carriers, 87 diabetic APOE epsilon4 non-carriers, 39 diabetic APOE epsilon4 carriers) ranging in age from 50 to 98 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cognitive function was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the similarities subtest from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, and four composite scores derived from 17 additional neuropsychological tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multiple linear regression analyses were employed to relate <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and APOE genotype to cognitive performance and to examine the interaction between these two risk factors as they relate to cognitive performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> risk factors were statistically controlled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: With adjustment for age, education, sex, race/ethnicity and APOE genotype, performance level was lower for the diabetic than for the non-diabetic group for the MMSE, the similarities subtest and each of the cognitive composites with the exception of the verbal memory composite </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interactions (p &lt; 0.05) between <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and APOE genotype were found for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but the visual-spatial memory/organisation composite </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The negative association between <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and cognitive performance was of a higher magnitude for individuals who carry one or more APOE epsilon4 alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results were similar with additional adjustment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> and associated risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The presence of one or more APOE epsilon4 alleles modifies the association between <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and cognitive function </plain></SENT>
