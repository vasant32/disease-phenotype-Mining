<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is increasing evidence that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> of the skeletal muscle plays a key role early in the development of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As a consequence recent research efforts have focussed on the characterization of insulin signal transduction elements in the muscle which are candidates for a localization of a defect causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> i.e. the insulin receptor, phosphatases related to insulin action, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase and the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transporters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this review we attempt to summarize present knowledge about abnormalities of these systems in skeletal muscle of Type 2 diabetic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pre-diabetic</z:e> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We try to classify abnormalities as secondary events or as candidates for putative primary molecular defects which might initiate the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> as early as in the "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pre-diabetic</z:e>" state </plain></SENT>
