<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The incidence of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> differs widely by race </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> is reportedly more common in East Asian type 2 diabetic patients than in their Caucasian counterparts, data on the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> are not available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to investigate the incidence and the determinants of <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> in Korean type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A cohort of 188 Korean type 2 diabetic patients with initial normoalbuminuria were followed prospectively for 5.5 +/- 0.9 years in an outpatient clinic of a university hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of elevated urinary albumin excretion (UAE) (&gt; 20 micrograms/min) and its relationship with baseline characteristics and follow-up data were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 146 patients who finished the study, 37 showed persistently elevated UAE during follow-up, giving an incidence of 52/1,000 person-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Age, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and baseline UAE were significantly higher in the progressors than in the nonprogressors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>More patients in the progressor group had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> at baseline and at the end of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean values of fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, HbA1, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure during the follow-up period were significantly higher in the progressors than in the nonprogressors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed that presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, mean fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and mean systolic blood pressure during follow-up are independent variables that have a statistically significant influence on the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> in Korean type 2 diabetic patients is lower than that reported in Pima Indians with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> but is as high as that in Caucasians with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Presence of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, poor glycemic control, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002842'>high blood pressure</z:mp> are risk factors for development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> in Koreans with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
