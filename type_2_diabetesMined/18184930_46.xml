<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is ameliorated by specific overexpression of GLUT4 in skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The molecular mechanisms regulating skeletal muscle GLUT4 expression remain to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to examine these mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS AND RESULTS: Here, we report that <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (AMPK) regulates GLUT4 transcription through the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylase (HDAC)5 transcriptional repressor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of HDAC5 represses GLUT4 reporter gene expression, and HDAC inhibition in human primary myotubes increases endogenous GLUT4 gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vitro kinase assays, site-directed mutagenesis, and site-specific phospho-antibodies establish AMPK as an HDAC5 kinase that targets S259 and S498 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Constitutively active but not dominant-negative AMPK and 5-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="22512">aminoimidazole</z:chebi>-4-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="23004,37622">carboxamide</z:chebi>-1-beta-D-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18254">ribonucleoside</z:chebi> (AICAR) treatment in human primary myotubes results in HDAC5 phosphorylation at S259 and S498, association with 14-3-3 isoforms, and H3 acetylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This reduces HDAC5 association with the GLUT4 promoter, as assessed through chromatin immunoprecipitation assays and HDAC5 nuclear export, concomitant with increases in GLUT4 gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Gene reporter assays also confirm that the HDAC5 S259 and S498 sites are required for AICAR induction of GLUT4 transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data reveal a signal transduction pathway linking cellular energy charge to gene transcription directed at restoring cellular and whole-body energy balance and provide new therapeutic targets for the treatment and management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
