<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigated the metabolic control of male prisoners with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Retrospective analysis of 4385 medical charts of male prisoners in Fukushima Prison from 1998 to 2004 revealed 109 prisoners (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Asian) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (mean+/-S.D.: 51+/-10 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were followed up during their imprisonment (14+/-10 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During imprisonment, mean fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> Alc (HbA1c) levels dramatically decreased from 184+/-74 to 113+/-38mg/dl (p&lt;0.001) and 8.4+/-2.1 to 5.9+/-1.2% (p&lt;0.001), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, 5 of 18 prisoners (28%) treated with insulin and 17 of 34 (50%) treated with oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi> were able to discontinue their treatment and maintain good metabolic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most prisoners in Japanese prisons work 8h a day 5 days a week, consuming a high dietary fiber diet including boiled rice with barley, "Mugimeshi" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that a well-regulated lifestyle and long-term intake of high dietary fiber may have beneficial effects on metabolic control in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
