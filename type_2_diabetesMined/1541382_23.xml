<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> in Sweden in the 15-34 year age group was prospectively studied on a nationwide basis, beginning 1 January 1983 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 1,214 male and 720 female cases of newly-diagnosed (excluding gestational) <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were reported over a 5-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This corresponds to an incidence of 20.5 per 100,000/year in male subjects and 12.7 per 100,000/year in female subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most cases were classified as Type 1 (insulin-dependent) <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, with an incidence of 15.9 in males and 8.6 in females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> decreased gradually with age, while the incidence of Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A male predominance was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> age groups, with a male-to-female ratio of 1.8:1 for Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 1.3:1 for Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Maximum blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration at diagnosis was significantly higher in males than in females in both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the percent desirable weight was significantly higher in females, both in Type 1 and Type 2 diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The difference in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence therefore cannot be attributed to any methodological error </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The present finding of a marked male predominance after puberty in Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in an ethnically quite homogeneous population supports the hypothesis that environmental risk factors and life-style are important for the development of the disease </plain></SENT>
