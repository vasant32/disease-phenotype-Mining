<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The aim of the study was to evaluate the relationship between insulin sensitivity, beta cell function and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, and its dependence on variants in the newly identified Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility gene, calpain-10 ( CAPN10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 203 men of the same age but with varying degrees of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These men participated in (i) an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test, (ii) a euglycaemic clamp combined with indirect calorimetry and infusion of [3-(3)H]-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and (iii) a stepwise assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin response to arginine (AIR) at three different <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations (fasting, 14 and 28 mmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a linear increase in NEFA levels ( p&lt;0.0005) and WHR ( p&lt;0.0005) and decrease in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake due to a reduction in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> storage over the entire range of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance ( r=-0.404; p&lt;0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No increase in endogenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production (EGP) was seen until patients had manifest <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, when EGP was expressed relative to fasting insulin concentrations, there was a linear deterioration of basal hepatic insulin sensitivity ( r=-0.514; p&lt;0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The AIR followed a bell-shaped curve with an initial rise and subsequent decrease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, AIR adjusted for insulin sensitivity (disposition index) showed a linear decrease with increasing <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations ( r=-0.563; p&lt;0.001) starting already in subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was an inverse correlation between increase in WHR and NEFA and peripheral as well as hepatic insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Subjects with the genotype combination of CAPN10 consisting of SNP44 TT and SNP43 GG genotypes had significantly lower insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake than carriers of the other genotype combinations (5.3+/-0.4 vs 7.2+/-0.4 mg.ffm kg(-1).min(-1).mU.l(-1); p&lt;0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We conclude that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pre-diabetic</z:e> state is characterised by a similar linear deterioration of peripheral and hepatic insulin sensitivity as beta cell function and that variants in the CAPN10 gene modify this relationship </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings are compatible with a common defect in muscle, liver and beta cells in the pathogenesis of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
