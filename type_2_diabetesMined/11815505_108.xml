<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of the addition of insulin when maximal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> therapy is inadequate in individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Glycemic control, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>, and body weight were monitored over 6 years in 826 patients with newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in 8 of 23 U.K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prospective <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study (UKPDS) centers that used a modified protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomly allocated to a conventional <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control policy, primarily with diet (n = 242) or an intensive policy with insulin alone (n = 245), as in the main study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, for patients randomized to an intensive policy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> (n = 339), insulin was added automatically if the fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> remained &gt;108 mg/dl (6.0 mmol/l) despite maximal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over 6 years, approximately 53% of patients allocated to treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> required additional insulin therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median HbA(1c) in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> +/- insulin group was significantly lower (6.6%, interquartile range [IQR] 6.0-7.6) than in the group taking insulin alone (7.1%, IQR 6.2-8.0; P = 0.0066), and significantly more patients in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> +/- insulin group had an HbA(1c) &lt;7% (47 vs. 35%, respectively; P = 0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>Weight gain</z:mp> was similar in the intensive therapy groups, but major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> occurred less frequently over <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> (+/- insulin) group compared with the insulin alone group (1.6 vs. 3.2% per annum, respectively; P = 0.017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Early addition of insulin when maximal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> therapy is inadequate can significantly improve glycemic control without promoting increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
