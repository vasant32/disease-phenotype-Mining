<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These polymorphisms were also examined in 100 Caucasian healthy blood donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Genotyping of eNOS polymorphisms was performed by PCR or PCR-RFLP and haplotype frequencies were estimated using a Bayesian method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis was done to test for association of eNOS polymorphisms with susceptibility to renal involvement (<z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp>, macroalbuminuria or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal disease</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This analysis was carried out assuming three different genetic models for the minor allele, adjusting for possible effect modifiers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Genotype and allele frequencies in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal disease</z:e> were not significantly different from those of patients with normoalbuminuria and healthy blood donors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eNOS polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Likewise, there were no differences in haplotype frequencies among healthy blood donors and type 2 diabetic patients with or without renal involvement (P&gt;0.05 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> comparisons) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: No associations between the -786T&gt;C, the VNTR intron 4 a/b and the 894G&gt;T (Glu298Asp) polymorphisms in the eNOS gene and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal disease</z:e> were observed in type 2 diabetic Caucasian-Brazilians </plain></SENT>
