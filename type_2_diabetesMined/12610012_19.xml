<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is not clear whether the insulin response to other stimuli, such as amino acids, is also diminished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, we defined an optimal insulinoptropic mixture containing free leucine, phenylalanine, and a protein hydrolysate that substantially enhances the insulin response in healthy young subjects when coingested with carbohydrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we aimed to investigate the insulinotropic capacity of this mixture in long-term type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Ten type 2 diabetic patients (aged 59.1 +/- 2.0 years, BMI 26.5 +/- 0.7 kg/m(2)) and 10 healthy control subjects (58.8 +/- 2.1 years, 26.5 +/- 0.7 kg/m(2)) visited our lab twice, during which insulin responses were determined following ingestion of carbohydrate only (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi>) or carbohydrate with the free amino acid/protein mixture (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi>+PRO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects received 0.7 g x kg(-1) x h(-1) carbohydrate with or without 0.35 g x kg(-1) x h(-1) of the amino acid/protein mixture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Insulin responses were dramatically increased in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi>+PRO trial in both the type 2 diabetic and control groups (189 and 114%, respectively) compared with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi> trial (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, glucagon, growth hormone, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi>, IGF-I, and IGF binding protein 3 responses were not different between trials within the 2-h time frame </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The insulin secretory capacity in long-term type 2 diabetic patients is substantially underestimated, as the insulin response following carbohydrate intake can be nearly tripled by coingestion of a free amino acid/protein mixture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Future research should be performed to investigate whether such nutritional interventions can improve postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal </plain></SENT>
