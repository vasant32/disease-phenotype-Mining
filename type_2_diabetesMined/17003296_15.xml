<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the effect of intentional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> on arterial stiffness is uncertain, and the purpose of the current study was to assess this effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Arterial stiffness was assessed by measuring aortic pulse wave velocity (aPWV) at baseline and at completion of a 1-year <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Metabolic control of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was also appraised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> at 1 year in 38 volunteers with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 7.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were improvements in HbA1c, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, and inflammatory markers (plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha, interleukin-6, and C-reactive protein) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was also a significant improvement in aPWV at completion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> intervention, from 740 to 690 cm/s (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> improves arterial stiffness in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
