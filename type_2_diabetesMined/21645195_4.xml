<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Appropriate methodology according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement was adhered to </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-six randomized studies, published as full papers, reporting the effect of insulin treatment on change in body weight were identified, and used to identify predictors of weight change; studies were included in a meta-analysis to study the effect of different insulin regimens or insulin analogues on weight change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Intensity of treatment [aim of study (fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, mg/dl), dose of insulin, final HbA1c, change of HbA1c and frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e>] was significantly associated with body weight increase, with small differences between basal versus twice-a-day and prandial regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At meta-analysis, body weight increase was lower with basal regimen than with twice-a-day regimen and than with a prandial regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Within <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> regimens, body weight increase was lower with detemir than with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e>, with no difference between glargine and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e>; only two studies directly compared detemir and glargine, indicating lower <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> with the former insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Within twice-a-day regimens and within prandial regimens, comparison was between newer analogues and older drugs, with no significant difference in body weight increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Body weight increase during the first year of insulin treatment is associated with the intensity of treatment; body weight increase also depends on the insulin regimen applied </plain></SENT>
