<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent studies into the <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> of the incretins <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent insulinotropic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (GIP) and glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) have added stimulation of beta-cell growth, differentiation, and cell survival to well-documented, potent insulinotropic effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, the therapeutic potential of these hormones is limited by their rapid enzymatic inactivation in vivo by dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DP IV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of DP IV, so as to enhance circulating incretin levels, has proved effective in the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> both in humans and in animal models, stimulating improvements in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and beta-cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that enhancement of the cytoprotective and beta-cell regenerative effects of GIP and GLP-1 might extend the therapeutic potential of DP IV inhibitors to include type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For testing this hypothesis, male Wistar rats, exposed to a single dose of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> (STZ; 50 mg/kg), were treated twice daily with the DP IV inhibitor P32/98 for 7 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Relative to STZ-injected controls, P32/98-treated animals displayed <z:mp ids='MP_0001260'>increased weight</z:mp> gain (230%) and nutrient intake, decreased fed blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> ( approximately 26 vs. approximately 20 mmol/l, respectively), and a return of plasma insulin values toward <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (0.07 vs. 0.12 nmol/l, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Marked improvements in oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, suggesting enhanced insulin secretory capacity, were corroborated by pancreas perfusion and insulin content measurements that revealed two- to eightfold increases in both secretory function and insulin content after 7 weeks of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analyses of pancreatic sections showed marked increases in the number of small islets (+35%) and total beta-cells (+120%) and in the islet beta-cell fraction (12% control vs. 24% treated) in the treated animals, suggesting that DP IV inhibitor treatment enhanced islet neogenesis, beta-cell survival, and insulin biosynthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In vitro studies using a beta-(INS-1) cell line showed a dose-dependent prevention of STZ-induced apoptotic cell-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> by both GIP and GLP-1, supporting a role for the incretins in eliciting the in vivo results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These novel findings provide evidence to support the potential utility of DP IV inhibitors in the treatment of type 1 and possibly late-stage type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
