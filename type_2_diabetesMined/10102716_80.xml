<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We and other investigators have shown that the level of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), a marker for <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, is increased in either the urine or the mononuclear cells of the blood of type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the association between type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in the pancreatic beta-cells has not been previously described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We measured the levels of 8-OHdG and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32585">4-hydroxy-2-nonenal</z:chebi> (HNE)-modified proteins in the pancreatic beta-cells of GK rats, a model of nonobese type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Quantitative immunohistochemical analyses with specific antibodies revealed higher levels of 8-OHdG and HNE-modified proteins in the pancreatic beta-cells of GK rats than in the control Wistar rats, with the levels increasing proportionally with age and <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> of the pancreatic islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We further investigated whether the levels of 8-OHdG and HNE-modified proteins would be modified in the pancreatic beta-cells of GK rats fed with 30% <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> solution or 50 ppm of voglibose (alpha-glucosidase inhibitor) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the GK rats, the levels of 8-OHdG and HNE-modified proteins, as well as islet <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, were increased by <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> treatment but reduced by voglibose treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the pancreatic beta-cells of GK rats are oxidatively stressed, and that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> might be responsible for the <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> observed in the pancreatic beta-cells </plain></SENT>
