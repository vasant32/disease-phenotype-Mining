<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively studied early changes in fasting insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion, assessed by a short intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test that was conducted several times from birth to 3 years of age in 55 SGA (birthweight below fifth percentile) newborns and in 13 newborns with a birthweight appropriate for gestational age (AGA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Most SGA infants showed postnatal upward weight centile crossing and by 3 years were similar in size to AGA infants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SGA infants had lower pre-feed insulin levels at postnatal age 48 h than AGA infants (median 34.4 vs 59.7 pmol/l, p&lt;0.05), but by the age of 3 years they had higher fasting insulin levels (median 38.9 vs 23.8 pmol/l, p&lt;0.005), which were related to rate of <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> between 0 and 3 years (r=0.47, p=0.0003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>First-phase insulin secretion did not differ between SGA and AGA infants, but SGA infants had a lower <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposition index (beta cell compensation) (median 235 vs 501 min mmol(-1) l(-1), p=0.02), which persisted after allowing for postnatal <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> (p=0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: SGA infants showed a marked transition from lower pre-feed insulin and <z:mp ids='MP_0002891'>increased insulin sensitivity</z:mp> at birth to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> over the first 3 years of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This transition was related to rapid postnatal <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>, which could indicate a propensity to central fat deposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The additional observation of reduced compensatory beta cell secretion underlines the need for long-term surveillance of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> SGA subjects, whether or not they show postnatal catch-up growth </plain></SENT>
