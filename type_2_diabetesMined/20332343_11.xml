<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We previously showed that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma in beta-cells regulates pdx-1 transcription through a functional PPAR response element (PPRE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Gene Bank blast for a homologous nucleotide sequence revealed the same PPRE within the rat <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent insulinotropic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> receptor (GIP-R) promoter sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the role of PPARgamma in GIP-R transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, siRNA, and luciferase gene transcription assay in INS-1 cells were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Islet GIP-R expression and immunohistochemistry studies were performed in pancreas-specific PPARgamma knockout mice (PANC PPARgamma(-/-)), normoglycemic 60% pancreatectomy rats (Px), normoglycemic and hyperglycemic <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> fatty (ZF) rats, and mouse islets incubated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In vitro studies of INS-1 cells confirmed that PPAR-gamma binds to the putative PPRE sequence and regulates GIP-R transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vivo verification was shown by a 70% reduction in GIP-R protein expression in islets from PANC PPARgamma(-/-) mice and a twofold increase in islets of 14-day post-60% Px Sprague-Dawley rats that hyperexpress beta-cell PPARgamma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thiazolidinedione activation (72 h) of this pathway in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mouse islets caused a threefold increase of GIP-R protein and a doubling of insulin secretion to 16.7 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>/10 nmol/l GIP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Islets from <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> normoglycemic ZF rats had twofold increased PPARgamma and GIP-R protein levels versus lean rats, with both lowered by two-thirds in ZF rats made hyperglycemic by 60% Px </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our studies have shown physiologic and pharmacologic regulation of GIP-R expression in beta-cells by PPARgamma signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Also disruption of this signaling pathway may account for the lowered beta-cell GIP-R expression and resulting GIP resistance in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
