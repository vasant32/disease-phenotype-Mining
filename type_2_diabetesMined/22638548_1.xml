<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: HRs for meeting the primary endpoint (nonfatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, nonfatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, resuscitated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> or cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality were analysed using Cox regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 8,252 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> included in SCOUT, 7,479 had measurements of HbA(1c) available at baseline (i.e. study randomisation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Median age was 62 years (range 51-86 years), median BMI was 34.0 kg/m(2) (24.8-65.1 kg/m(2)) and 44% were women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median HbA(1c) concentration was 7.2% (3.8-15.9%) (55 mmol/l [18-150 mmol/l]) and median <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration was 7 years (0-57 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For each 1 percentage point HbA(1c) increase, the adjusted HR for the primary endpoint was 1.17 (95% CI 1.11, 1.23); no differential sex effect was observed (p = 0.12 for interaction) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality was found to be greater in women than in men: HR 1.22 (1.10, 1.34) vs 1.12 (1.04, 1.20) for each 1 percentage point HbA(1c) increase (p = 0.02 for interaction) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence of increased risk associated with HbA(1c) ≤ 6.4% (≤ 46 mmol/l) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In overweight, cardiovascular high-risk patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, increasing HbA(1c) concentrations were associated with increasing risks of cardiovascular adverse outcomes and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality </plain></SENT>
