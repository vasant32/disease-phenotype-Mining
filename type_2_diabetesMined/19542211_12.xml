<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed the predictive role of serum <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> levels on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause and cardiovascular mortality in a large cohort of type 2 diabetic individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The cohort included 2,726 type 2 diabetic outpatients, who were followed for a mean period of 4.7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The independent association of serum <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> levels with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause and cardiovascular mortality was assessed by Cox proportional hazards models and adjusted for conventional risk factors and several potential confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During follow-up, 329 (12.1%) patients died, 44.1% (n = 145) of whom from cardiovascular causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In univariate analysis, higher serum <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> levels were significantly associated with increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause (hazard ratio 19 [95% CI 1.12-1.27], P &lt; 0.001) and cardiovascular (1.25 [1.16-1.34], P &lt; 0.001) mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for age, sex, BMI, smoking, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration, A1C, medication use (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="40279">allopurinol</z:chebi> or hypoglycemic, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering, and antiplatelet drugs), estimated glomerular filtration rate, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp>, the association of serum <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> with cardiovascular mortality remained statistically significant (1.27 [1.01-1.61], P = 0.046), whereas the association of serum <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Higher serum <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> levels are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular mortality in type 2 diabetic patients, independent of several potential confounders, including renal function measures </plain></SENT>
