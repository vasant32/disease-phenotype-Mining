<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyze the difference in complexity of the glycemic profile in healthy volunteers (H), patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> (MS), and patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We measured interstitial fluid <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> every 5 minutes for 3 days in 10 H, 10 MS, and 10 DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Complexity of the glycemic profile was evaluated by means of detrended fluctuation analysis (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="23716">DFA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE) was also calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: GLUCOSE PROFILE WAS MORE COMPLEX (LOWER <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23716">DFA</z:chebi>) IN HEALTHY SUBJECTS THAN IN PATIENTS WITH MS OR DM (MEAN <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23716">DFA</z:chebi> [SD]: H: 1.25 (0.10), MS: 1.39 (0.07), DM: 1.42 (0.10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ANOVA: F(2,27) = 9.94, p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DM had also a less complex profile than MS, but this difference was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was an inverse relation between complexity (lower <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23716">DFA</z:chebi>) and the number of MS defining criteria (rho = 0.55, p = 0.002) and between complexity and MAGE (r = 0.68, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is a progressive loss of complexity in the glycemic profile from health, through the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> to type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This loss of complexity precedes <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> and correlates with other markers of disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Complexity analysis may be a useful tool to track the evolution from health to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it may provide a way to measure glycemic control in real-life situations and has some distinct advantages over other conventional variability metrics </plain></SENT>
