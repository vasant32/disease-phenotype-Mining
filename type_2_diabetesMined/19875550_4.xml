<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This study reviewed the research reports dealing with nonpharmacologic interventions aimed at preventing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with early lifestyle interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results from the randomized controlled trials <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> show that people with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> who received enhanced lifestyle advice had significantly lower (on average approximately 50% reduced) incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with those allocated to receive "usual care." Individuals who were able to correct their lifestyle habits as recommended for usual healthy life patterns were mostly protected against type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, compelling evidence exists that most of the cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> can be prevented or at least the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the disease can be significantly delayed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Randomized controlled trials have unequivocally demonstrated that lifestyle management is highly efficient in the prevention and also in the early management of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This evidence of lifestyle modification in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention is stronger than for most other multifactorial diseases </plain></SENT>
