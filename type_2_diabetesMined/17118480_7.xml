<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>About 115 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi> for 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUR1 genotypes were tested by Taqman-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi> treatment, there was association between T/G polymorphism and decrease of HbA1c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>G carriers were more sensitive to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi> and the decrease of HbA1c was more significant than TT genotype (TT, 0.76%+/-1.70%; TG+GG, 1.60%+/-1.39%, P=0.044) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The polymorphism of SUR1S1369A was associated with the therapeutic efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
