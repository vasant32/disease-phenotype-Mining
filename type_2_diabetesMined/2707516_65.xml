<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using data from this register and from a case-referent study, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> incident Type 1 diabetic children in Sweden during one year and, for each patient, two referent children matched according to age, sex and county, we have studied the associations between Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and familial Type 1 and Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, thyroid, adrenal, allergic, rheumatic, heart and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021831" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean annual incidence per 100,000 during the nine year period was 25.1 for boys and 23.5 for girls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 8.5% of the patients, one parent had Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 73% of whom were fathers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifty-six of the patients (1.7%) had a parent with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of parental Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> tended to be higher in patients with younger age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>; whereas, the opposite was found for patients with parental Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the case-referent study, the age-adjusted odds ratio for Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> when a first and/or second degree relative had Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 5.5 (95% confidence limits 4.0-7.7), and in accordance with the findings of the case register, the odds ratio tended to be highest in patients with the youngest age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio for Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was significantly increased 3.3 (95% confidence limits: 2.3-4.6) when Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was reported in relatives (three generations).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
