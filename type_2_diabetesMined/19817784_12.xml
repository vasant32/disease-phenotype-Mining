<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are targets of approximately 30% of currently marketed drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Over the last few years, a number of GPCRs expressed in pancreatic beta-cells and activated by <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> have been discovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>GPR40 was shown to be activated by medium- to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15904">long-chain fatty acids</z:chebi> (FAs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It has since been shown that GPR40 contributes to FA amplification of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although some controversy still exists as to whether GPR40 <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> should be designed as novel type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> drugs, data obtained in our laboratory and others strongly suggest that GPR40 agonism might represent a valuable therapeutic approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>GPR119 is expressed in pancreatic beta-cells and enteroendocrine L-cells, and augments circulating insulin levels both through its direct insulinotropic action on beta-cells and through FA stimulation of glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> 1 (GLP-1) secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>GPR120 is expressed in L-cells and was also shown to mediate FA-stimulated GLP-1 release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, GPR41 and GPR43 are receptors for short-chain FAs and may indirectly regulate beta-cell function via adipokine secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although the discovery of these various <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> receptors opens new and exciting avenues of research for drug development, a number of questions regarding their mechanisms of action and physiological roles remain to be answered </plain></SENT>
