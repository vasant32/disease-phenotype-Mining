<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with the most convincing evidence of association in 12 type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-associated gene regions, PPARG, CDKAL1, HNF1B, WFS1, SLC30A8, CDKN2A-CDKN2B, IGF2BP2, KCNJ11, TCF7L2, FTO, HHEX-IDE and THADA, were analysed in type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> cases and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PPARG and HHEX-IDE were additionally tested for association in 3,851 type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tests for interaction with HLA class II genotypes, autoantibody status, sex, and age-at-diagnosis of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were performed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 12 gene regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Only PPARG and HHEX-IDE showed any evidence of association with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> cases and controls (p = 0.004 and p = 0.003, respectively; p &gt; 0.05 for other SNPs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The potential association of PPARG was supported by family analyses (p = 0.003; p (combined) = 1.0 x 10(-4)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No SNPs showed evidence of interaction with any covariate (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We found no convincing genetic link between type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An association of PPARG (rs1801282/Pro12Ala) could be consistent with its known function in <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hence, our results reinforce evidence suggesting that type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is a disease of the immune system, rather than being due to inherited defects in beta cell function or regeneration or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
