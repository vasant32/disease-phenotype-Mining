<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe the prevalence of biochemical B(12) deficiency in adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> taking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> compared with those not taking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and those without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and explore whether this relationship is modified by vitamin B(12) supplements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Analysis of data on U.S. adults ≥50 years of age with (n = 1,621) or without type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 6,867) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 1999-2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was defined as clinical diagnosis after age 30 without initiation of insulin therapy within 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Those with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were classified according to their current <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Biochemical B(12) deficiency was defined as serum B(12) concentrations ≤148 pmol/L and borderline deficiency was defined as &gt;148 to ≤221 pmol/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Biochemical B(12) deficiency was present in 5.8% of those with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> compared with 2.4% of those not using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (P = 0.0026) and 3.3% of those without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P = 0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among those with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> use was associated with biochemical B(12) deficiency (adjusted odds ratio 2.92; 95% CI 1.26-6.78) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Consumption of any supplement containing B(12) was not associated with a reduction in the prevalence of biochemical B(12) deficiency among those with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, whereas consumption of any supplement containing B(12) was associated with a two-thirds reduction among those without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> therapy is associated with a higher prevalence of biochemical B(12) deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The amount of B(12) recommended by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) (2.4 μg/day) and the amount available in general multivitamins (6 μg) may not be enough to correct this deficiency among those with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
