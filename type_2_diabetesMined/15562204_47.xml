<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explain the stronger effect of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> (CHD) in women compared with men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study population consisted of 1,296 nondiabetic subjects and 835 type 2 diabetic subjects aged 45-64 years without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The end points were CHD <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and a major CHD event (CHD <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or nonfatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The follow-up time was 13 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Major CHD event rate per 1,000 person-years was 11.6 in nondiabetic men, 1.8 in nondiabetic women, 36.3 in diabetic men, and 31.6 in diabetic women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related hazard ratio for a major CHD event from the Cox model, adjusted for age and area of residence, was 2.9 (95% CI 2.2-3.9) in men and 14.4 (8.4-24.5) in women, and after further adjustment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, 2.8 (2.0-3.7) and 9.5 (5.5-16.9), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The burden of conventional risk factors in the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was greater in women than in men at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prospectively, elevated blood pressure, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003233'>low HDL cholesterol</z:hpo>, and high <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> contributed to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related CHD risk more in women than in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, after adjusting for conventional risk factors, a substantial proportion of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related CHD risk remained unexplained in both genders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The stronger effect of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on the risk of CHD in women compared with men was in part explained by a heavier risk factor burden and a greater effect of blood pressure and atherogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> in diabetic women </plain></SENT>
