<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Less is known about the relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: To examine this issue, we determined insulin sensitivity (SI) in 479 type 2 diabetic subjects by minimal model analyses of frequently sampled intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin Resistance</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Study (IRAS), a large multicenter study of insulin sensitivity and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> in African-Americans, Hispanics, and non-Hispanic whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We defined insulin-sensitive subjects as having SI &gt; or = 1.61 x 10(-4) min-1.microU-1.ml-1 (above median in nondiabetic subjects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ethnic groups in the IRAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using this definition, only 37 type 2 diabetic subjects were insulin sensitive, and the remaining 442 were insulin resistant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, and clinic, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> was significantly correlated with total <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47773">VLDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47776">VLDL triglyceride</z:chebi>, fibrinogen, PAI-1, and fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and was inversely correlated with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> level and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Carotid intimal-medial thickness was greater in insulin-resistant than in insulin-sensitive subjects, but this difference was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After further adjustment for waist circumference (marker of visceral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e>), insulin-resistant subjects continued to have higher plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47776">VLDL triglyceride</z:chebi> levels, lower <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> levels, and smaller <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> particle size than did insulin-sensitive subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After further adjustment for fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, these results were very similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that insulin-resistant type 2 diabetic subjects have more atherogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factor</z:e> profiles than insulin-sensitive type 2 diabetic subjects and that this is only partially related to increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and an adverse body fat distribution </plain></SENT>
