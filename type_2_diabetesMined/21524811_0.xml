<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The increased risk of fractures in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> can partly be explained by poor bone quality and extra-skeletal factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A retrospective study was conducted to compare the outcome of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2567">alendronate</z:chebi> (ALN) treatment for 3 years in postmenopausal osteoporotic Japanese women with or without type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One-hundred and fifty-one postmenopausal osteoporotic Japanese women (mean age at baseline: 67.8 years) who had been treated with ALN for more than 3 years in our outpatient clinic were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) was measured using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, and the urinary levels of cross-linked N-terminal telopeptides of type I collagen (NTX) and the serum levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were monitored during the 3-year treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521170" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">osteoporotic fractures</z:e> was also assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixteen women had type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and were receiving pharmacological treatment, and 135 were non-diabetic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The urinary NTX and serum ALP levels significantly decreased and the lumbar spine BMD significantly increased, compared with the baseline values, without causing any severe adverse events including <z:hpo ids='HP_0010885'>osteonecrosis</z:hpo> of the jaw, femoral diaphysis atypical fractures, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, in a manner that was similar among women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and non-diabetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the incidence of non-vertebral fractures was significantly higher among women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than among the non-diabetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ALN treatment appeared to have the similar effect on surrogate markers in postmenopausal osteoporotic Japanese women with or without type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because of lacking in statistical power for fracture incidence due to the small sample size, further studies are warranted to confirm the results of the fracture incidence </plain></SENT>
