<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both have multiple effects that are potentially useful in treating <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>L cell number and hormone content in the intestine are highest in the rectum in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effects of intrarectal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36276">sodium taurocholate</z:chebi> on plasma GLP-1, PYY, insulin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations, and on food intake of a subsequent meal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> type 2 diabetic volunteers were each studied on five separate occasions after an overnight fast and oral administration of 100 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> 10 h before the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They then received an intrarectal infusion of either one of four doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36257">taurocholate</z:chebi> (0.66, 2, 6.66 or 20 mmol, each in 20 ml of vehicle) or vehicle alone (1% carboxymethyl cellulose) single-blind over 1 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hormone and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> measurements were made prior to, and for 1 h following, the infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The consumption of a previously selected favourite meal eaten to satiety was measured 75 min after the infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36257">Taurocholate</z:chebi> dose-dependently increased GLP-1, PYY and insulin, with 20 mmol doses resulting in peak concentrations 7.2-, 4.2- and 2.6-fold higher, respectively, than those achieved with placebo (p &lt; 0.0001 for each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> decreased by up to 3.8 mmol/l (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Energy intake was decreased dose-dependently by up to 47% (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The ED(50) values for effects on integrated GLP-1, insulin, PYY, food intake and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering responses were 8.1, 10.5, 18.5, 24.2 and 25.1 mmol, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Therapies that increase <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22868">bile salts</z:chebi> (or their mimics) in the distal bowel may be valuable in the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
