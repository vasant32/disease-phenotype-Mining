<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Physical fitness was evaluated using the "EUROFIT Physical Fitness Test Battery" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This battery estimates body composition, cardiopulmonary, musculoskeletal and motor fitness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Percentage of body fat (PBF) was higher in the diabetic compared with control groups (P&lt;0.05) although body mass index (BMI) was similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Biceps and suprailiac skinfold thickness were also greater in the diabetic group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 6-min walking distance and VO(2max) were significantly lower in the diabetic group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The diabetic patients had lower values of the single leg balance test with eyes opened and closed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Jump-stretch, handgrip and side-bending of trunk tests were also lower in the diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Physical functional capacity is lower in Type 2 diabetic patients than in age-matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
