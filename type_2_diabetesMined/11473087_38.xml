<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is caused by the immune-mediated destruction of islet insulin-secreting beta-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> destructive process is associated with both cellular and humoral immune changes in the peripheral blood that can be detected months or even years before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of clinical <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Throughout this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetic</z:e> period, metabolic changes, including altered <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance and <z:mp ids='MP_0003059'>reduced insulin secretion</z:mp>, deteriorate at variable rates and eventually result in clinical <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A fraction of individuals with humoral immunological changes have clinical <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> that initially is not insulin-requiring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in these patients is usually in adult life, and because their <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is at least initially not insulin-requiring, they appear clinically to be affected by type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Such patients probably have the same disease process as patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in that they have similar HLA genetic susceptibility as well as autoantibodies to islet antigens, low insulin secretion, and a higher rate of progression to insulin dependency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These patients are defined as being affected by an autoimmune type of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> not requiring insulin at diagnosis, which is also named latent autoimmune <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> of the adult (LADA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Special attention should be paid to diagnose such patients because therapy may influence the speed of progression toward insulin dependency, and in this respect, efforts should be made to protect residual C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>LADA can serve as a model for designing new strategies for prevention of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> but also as a target group for prevention in its own right </plain></SENT>
