<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To estimate the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and treatment satisfaction for patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the Netherlands and to examine which patient characteristics are associated with quality of life and treatment satisfaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: For a sample of 1,348 type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients, recruited by 29 general practitioners, we collected data regarding HRQOL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was performed as part of a larger European study (Cost of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> in Europe - Type 2 [CODE-2]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used a generic instrument (Euroqol 5D) to measure HRQOL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment satisfaction was assessed using the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients without complications had an HRQOL (0.74) only slightly lower than similarly aged persons in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Insulin therapy, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and complications were associated with a lower HRQOL, independent of age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although higher fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and HbA1c levels were negatively associated with HRQOL, these factors were not significant after adjustment for other factors using multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall treatment satisfaction was very high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Younger patients, patients using insulin, and patients with higher HbA1c levels were less satisfied with the treatment than other patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> and the presence of complications are important determinants of HRQOL in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
