<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Isoglycemic oral (75 g) and intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> administration was performed in 51 subjects (24 with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance [NGT], 17 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> [IGT], and 10 with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) with a wide range of BMI (20-61 kg/m(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> deconvolution was used to reconstruct insulin secretion rates, and beta-cell <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> sensitivity (slope of the insulin secretion/<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration dose-response curve) was determined by mathematical modeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incretin effect was defined as the oral-to-intravenous ratio of responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 8 subjects with NGT and 10 with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> appearance was measured by the double-tracer technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incretin effect on total insulin secretion and beta-cell <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> sensitivity and the GLP-1 response to oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> were significantly reduced in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with NGT or IGT (P &lt;or= 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results were similar when subjects were stratified by BMI tertile (P &lt;or= 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the whole dataset, each manifestation of the incretin effect was inversely related to both <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (2-h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels) and BMI (partial r = 0.27-0.59, P &lt;or= 0.05) in an independent, additive manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> appearance did not differ between <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and NGT and was positively related to the GLP-1 response (r = 0.53, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Glucagon suppression during the oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test was blunted in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Potentiation of insulin secretion, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> sensing, glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 release, and glucagon suppression are physiological manifestations of the incretin effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> tolerance and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> impair the incretin effect independently of one another </plain></SENT>
