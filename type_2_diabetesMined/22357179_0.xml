<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To explore their potential as prognostic markers, we characterized two factors in the complement cascade, the end product sC5b-9 and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi>-binding lectin-associated Ser protease-2 (MASP-2), in type 2 diabetic patients with suspected MI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Plasma sC5b-9 and MASP-2 were determined in patients with MI and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 397; median age 70; male 68%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The adjudicated end points were cardiovascular events (CVEs), including cardiovascular mortality and nonfatal MI or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median sC5b-9 was 134 μg/L (interquartile range [IQR] 101-190 μg/L) and the median MASP-2 was 333 μg/L (IQR 235-463 μg/L), with no significant correlation between them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Women had higher sC5b-9 than men (median 152 vs. 130 μg/L; P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both sC5b-9 and MASP-2 were correlated to age and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance, while MASP-2 was also correlated to BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During a median follow-up of 2.4 years, CVEs occurred in 141 patients (36%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both sC5b-9 (hazard ratio 1.37 [95% CI 1.13-1.65]; P &lt; 0.01) and MASP-2 (0.68 [0.51-0.92]; P = 0.01) predicted CVEs in unadjusted analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After multiple adjustments, the predictive capacity remained for sC5b-9 (1.30 [1.02-1.66]; P = 0.04) but not for MASP-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In type 2 diabetic patients with MI, high levels of sC5b-9 predict future CVE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This indicates that the complement system may play a significant role in the pathology of the subsequent myocardial damage and that the pathways leading to complement activation warrant further exploration as potential therapeutic targets to improve the prognosis for these patients </plain></SENT>
