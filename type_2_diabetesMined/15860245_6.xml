<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The subjects comprised 1004 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pulse-wave velocity (PWV) was used as a marker of arterial stiffness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical characteristics, including PWV and diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (DR), were investigated in a cross-sectional study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PWV, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, systolic blood pressure and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c level were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significantly higher in patients with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> than in individuals without this disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The association between brachial-ankle PWV and diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> remained significant after statistical adjustment, with increasing odds ratios (ORs) from the second quartile (OR, 2.09; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.21-3.61), to the third (OR, 2.80; 95% CI, 1.61-4.86) and fourth (OR, 4.64; 95% CI, 2.54-8.52) quartiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> was, therefore, associated with arterial stiffness in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings also suggested that PWV might be a marker of vascular injury caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
