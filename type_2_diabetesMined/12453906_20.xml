<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we observed deposition of C5b-9, the terminal product of complement activation, in the wall of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vessels of human eye donors with 9 +/- 3 years of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but not in the vessels of age-matched nondiabetic donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>C5b-9 often colocalized with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>C1q and C4, the complement components unique to the classical pathway, were not detected in the diabetic retinas, suggesting that C5b-9 was generated via the alternative pathway, the spontaneous activation of which is regulated by complement inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diabetic donors showed a prominent reduction in the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> levels of CD55 and CD59, the two complement inhibitors linked to the plasma membrane by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24410">glycosylphosphatidylinositol</z:chebi> anchors, but not in the levels of transmembrane CD46 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similar complement activation in <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vessels and selective reduction in the levels of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> CD55 and CD59 were observed in rats with a 10-week duration of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi>-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> causes defective regulation of complement inhibitors and complement activation that precede most other manifestations of diabetic <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microangiopathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
