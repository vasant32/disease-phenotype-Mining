<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hearing loss was defined as the pure-tone average (<z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>) of the thresholds frequency at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz greater than 25 dB hearing levels (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>) in the worse ear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> status was determined by self-report of physician-diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or by oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 699 subjects studied (age 52.9+/-1.0 years), 103 subjects were classified as having type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> of diabetic subjects was 120+/-19 mg/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hearing loss levels were (worse) higher among diabetic subjects compared with subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (NGT) (30.7+/-13.0 dB versus 27.4+/-12.3 dB, P=0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hearing loss was more prevalent among diabetic subjects than among subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (60.2% versus 45.2%, P=0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio (OR) of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for the presence of hearing loss was 1.87 (95% confidence interval 1.20-2.91, P=0.006) in a logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, rank, cigarette smoking and <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is associated with hearing loss independently of lifestyle factors in middle-aged men </plain></SENT>
