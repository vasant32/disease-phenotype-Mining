<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: SCOUT is an ongoing, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled outcome trial in cardiovascular high-risk overweight/<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 10 742 patients received single-blind sibutramine and individualized weight management during the 6-week lead-in period; 84% had a history of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and additional co-morbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Post-hoc analyses assessed anthropomorphic and vital sign responses between patients with and without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Concomitant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> medication use was reported by 86% of the diabetic patients (approximately 30% required insulin-alone or in combination) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Body weight and waist circumference decreased in diabetic patients: median 2.1 kg; 2.0 cm (both men and women); for those on insulin: 1.9 kg; 1.5/2.0 cm (men/women); without insulin: 2.3 kg; 2.0 cm (both men and women); blood pressure (BP) was also reduced (median systolic/diastolic 3.5/1.0 mmHg) with larger reductions in diabetic patients who were hypertensive and/or lost the most weight (&gt;5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In diabetic patients who entered with BP at target (&lt;130/&lt;85 mmHg) but did not lose weight (N = 245), increases of 3.5/2.0 mmHg were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Non-diabetic patients had greater weight losses (2.5 kg) but smaller reductions in BP (systolic/diastolic -2.5/-0.5 mmHg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pulse rate increases were less in diabetic vs. non-diabetic patients (1.5 vs. 2.0 bpm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In these high-risk diabetic patients, sibutramine and lifestyle modifications for 6 weeks resulted in small, but clinically relevant, median reductions in body weight, waist circumference and BP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A small median increase in pulse rate was recorded </plain></SENT>
