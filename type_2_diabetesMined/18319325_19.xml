<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In 1998, 1,143 primary care patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> participated in the Zwolle Outpatient <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> project Integrating Available Care (ZODIAC) study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At baseline, HRQOL was assessed with the RAND-36 and, after almost 6 years, life status was retrieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to investigate the association between HRQOL (continuous data) and mortality with adjustment for selected confounders (smoking, age, sex, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration, A1C, renal function, BMI, blood pressure, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, and macrovascular complications) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The Physical Component Summary of the RAND-36 was inversely associated with mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 0.979 [95% CI 0.966-0.992]), as were two separate RAND-36 dimensions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study found that HRQOL is an independent marker of mortality and emphasizes the importance of looking beyond clinical parameters in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
