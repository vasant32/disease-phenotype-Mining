<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Repaglinide and nateglinide represent a new class of insulin secretagogues, structurally unrelated to sulphonylureas, that were developed for the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The inhibitory effect of these drugs was investigated on recombinant <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and mutant Kir6.2/SUR1 channels expressed in HEK293 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nateglinide and repaglinide dose-dependently inhibited whole-cell Kir6.2/SUR1 currents with half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) values of 800 and 21 nmol/l, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mutation of serine 1237 in SUR1 to tyrosine (S1237Y) abolished <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27999">tolbutamide</z:chebi> and nateglinide block, suggesting that these drugs share a common point of interaction on the SUR1 subunit of the ATP-sensitive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> channel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, repaglinide inhibition was unaffected by the S1237Y mutation (IC(50) = 23 nmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Radioligand binding studies revealed a single high-affinity binding site for [(3)H]repaglinide on membranes prepared from HEK293 cells expressing <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (equilibrium dissociation constant [K(D)] = 0.40 nmol/l) or mutant (K(D) = 0.31 nmol/l) Kir6.2/SUR1 channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nateglinide and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27999">tolbutamide</z:chebi> displaced [(3)H]repaglinide binding to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> channels with IC(50) values of 0.7 and 26 micro mol/l, respectively, but produced &lt;10% displacement of [(3)H]repaglinide bound to mutant channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is consistent with the idea that binding of nateglinide and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27999">tolbutamide</z:chebi>, but not repaglinide, is abolished by the SUR1[S1237Y] mutation and that the binding site for repaglinide is not identical to that of nateglinde/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27999">tolbutamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results are discussed in terms of a conformational analysis of the drug molecules </plain></SENT>
