<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although muscle <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake plays a key role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the dynamics of GLUT4 translocation and the signaling involved are not well described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have now developed a confocal imaging technique to follow trafficking of green fluorescent protein-labeled proteins in living muscle fibers in situ in anesthetized mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using this technique, by imaging the dynamics of GLUT4 translocation and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 P(3) (PIP(3)) production in response to insulin, here, for the first time, we delineate the temporal and spatial distribution of these processes in a living animal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We find a 10-min delay of maximal GLUT4 recruitment and translocation to t-tubules compared with sarcolemma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Time-lapse imaging of a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="51121">fluorescent dye</z:chebi> after intravenous injection shows that this delay is similar to the time needed for insulin diffusion into the t-tubule system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Correspondingly, immunostaining of muscle fibers shows that insulin receptors are present throughout the t-tubule system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, PIP(3) production, an early event in insulin signaling, progresses slowly along the t-tubules with a 10-min delay between maximal PIP(3) production at sarcolemma compared with deep t-tubules following the appearance of dye-labeled insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings in living mice indicate a major role of the t-tubules in insulin signaling in skeletal muscle and show a diffusion-associated delay in insulin action between sarcolemma and inner t-tubules </plain></SENT>
