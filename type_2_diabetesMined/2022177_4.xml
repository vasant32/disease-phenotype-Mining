<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prevalences of LJM and DC were not significantly different in diabetic and control subjects (LJM: odds ratio 1.58, 95% CI 0.99 to 2.50; DC: odds ratio 1.34, CI 0.81 to 2.23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cigarette smoking was positively associated with both LJM and DC in the diabetic patients (LJM: relative risk (R) = 1.96, 95% CI 1.10 to 3.49; DC: R = 2.88, CI 1.29 to 6.43) and in the control group (LJM: R = 2.22, CI 1.70 to 5.86; DC: R = 2.71, CI 1.23 to 5.89) </plain></SENT>
