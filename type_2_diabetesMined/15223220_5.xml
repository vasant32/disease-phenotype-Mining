<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Common carotid and femoral arterial stiffness was ultrasonographically evaluated using stiffness index beta in 23 type 2 diabetic subjects before and after a 3-week exercise protocol including ergometer and walking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity (Clamp-IR) was assessed using euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp before and after the protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Arterial stiffness was also examined in steady hyperinsulinemic state during clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Anthropometrical factors did not change following exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clamp-IR tended to increase after exercise protocol (P = 0.061) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Stiffness index beta decreased following exercise in both common carotid and femoral arteries (P = 0.020 and P &lt; 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DeltaClamp-IR was significantly correlated with the changes in stiffness index beta of both common carotid (P = 0.040) and femoral artery (P = 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Divided into tertiles according to DeltaClamp-IR, decreases in stiffness index beta for both common carotid (P = 0.009) and femoral (P = 0.037) arteries was greater in tertile group with a higher DeltaClamp-IR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>Hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> during clamp decreased stiffness index beta in both common carotid (P = 0.031) and femoral (P = 0.025) arteries before exercise, but these effects disappeared after the exercise protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Short-term aerobic exercise significantly decreased arterial stiffness in both common carotid and femoral arteries, and the reduction of stiffness was associated with improvement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
