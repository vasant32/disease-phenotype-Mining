<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) is likewise related to body weight as well as with its increase during the adult life in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>-overweight people and whether this relationship is different between the genders is the question asked by the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We measured FPG in 1063 overweight-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects (395M/668F) with BMI &gt; or =25 kgm(-2) and classified with no history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and with a FPG&lt; 7 mmol/l, who consequently came to the Outpatient Clinic of our <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Unit to obtain dietetic advice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Weight increase was determined as the difference between actual weight and weight at 18 years (weight-diff), including only patients with weight-diff&gt; 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By univariate analysis age, BMI, waist circumference and weight change were loosely related to FPG in both sexes, even if the relation between plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and anthropometric variables was more consistent in females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By multivariate regression analysis, after adjusting for age, waist circumference, menopausal status and smoking habit, FPG was significantly related to both waist circumference and weight-diff only in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Odds Ratio for fasting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> (FPG&gt; 6.11 mmol/l), for each S.D. unit increase in weight-diff, after adjusting for age, waist circumference, smoking habit and menopausal status was 1.272; 95% CI: 0.863-1.901 (p=ns) for males and 1.800; 95% CI: 1.239-2.652 (p=0.002) for women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion our findings suggest that in non-diabetic overweight-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> people, after controlling for main cofounders, anthropometric variables and in particular waist circumference and weight change after 18 years are linearly related to FPG in women, independently predicting the risk of fasting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> only in these latter </plain></SENT>
