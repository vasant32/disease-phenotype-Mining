<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fibrin clot structure has been related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore assessed this in type 2 diabetic patients as a potential mechanism whereby <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> influences <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fibrin clots were formed from fibrinogen purified from 150 subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and varying degrees of glycaemic control (assessed by HbA1c), and from 50 matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clot structure was assessed by turbidity, permeation and confocal microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The specific effect of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> itself was assessed by analysing the structure of clots formed from purified fibrinogen in the presence of increasing concentrations of the sugar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Clots formed by fibrinogen purified from type 2 diabetic subjects had a denser, less porous structure than those from control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The structural changes found were related to the individual's glycaemic control; HbA1c correlated negatively with permeation coefficient (Ks) values (indicates clot pore size) (r = -0.57, p &lt; 0.0001) and positively with maximum absorbance (indicator of fibre size) (r = 0.33, p &lt; 0.0001), branch point number (r = 0.78, p &lt; 0.0001) and fibre density (r = 0.63, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ambient <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level influenced clot structure; hypo- (&lt; 5 mmol) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> (&gt; or = 10 mmol/l) were both associated with a reduction in Ks values and maximum absorbance, and with increased fibre density and branch point number within clots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The structural differences found to occur in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and in association with hypo- and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> may confer increased resistance to fibrinolysis, and in consequence contribute to the increase in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
