<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 56 subjects with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 97 subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and 50 control subjects were recruited from a hospital in Ethiopia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BCP was determined in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects and PGCP in 86 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean (+/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) BCP, PGCP, and the increment after glucagon in type 1 diabetic subjects (0.14 +/- 0.04, 0.22 +/- 0.11, and 0.08 +/- 0.05 nmol/l, respectively) were lower (P &lt; 0.001) than those in type 2 diabetic subjects (0.66 +/- 0.04, 1.25 +/- 0.10, and 0.56 +/- 0.06 nmol/l, respectively) or control subjects (0.54 +/- 0.04, 1.52 +/- 0.26, and 1.11 +/- 0.24 nmol/l, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean BCP level was higher in type 2 diabetic subjects than control subjects (P=0.015), whereas the mean increment was lower (P=0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Insulin-treated type 2 diabetic subjects, compared with non-insulin-treated type 2 diabetic subjects, had lower mean BCP (0.55 +/- 0.08 nmol/l [n=37] vs. 0.73 +/- 0.04 [n=60], P=0.001), lower PGCP (0.97 +/- 0.20 nmol/l [n=18] vs. 1.40 +/- 0.11 [n=35], P=0.010), and a lower C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> increment (0.34 +/- 0.06 [n=18] vs. 0.67 +/- 0.07 nmol/l [n=35], P=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In both the type 1 and type 2 diabetic groups, those with BCP levels &lt;0.2 nmol/l had lower BMI than those with higher BCP levels (P=0.023 and P &lt; 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Combined with clinical criteria, C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels are good discriminators between type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Ethiopians and may also be useful in identifying subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who require insulin therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There is a subgroup of type 2 diabetic subjects with features of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
