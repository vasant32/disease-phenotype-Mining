<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that renal function in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> correlates better with tubular changes than with glomerular pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since advanced glycation end products (AGEs; AGE-albumin) and in particular carboxymethyllysine (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) are known to play a central role in diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, we studied the activation of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) in tubular epithelial cells in vivo and in vitro by AGE-albumin and <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Urine samples from healthy control subjects (n = 50) and type 2 diabetic patients (n = 100) were collected and tested for excretion of <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> and the presence of proximal tubular epithelial cells (pTECs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> excretion was significantly higher in diabetic patients than in healthy control subjects (P &lt; 0.0001) and correlated with the degree of <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> (r = 0.7, P &lt; 0.0001), while there was no correlation between <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> excretion and HbA(1c) (r = 0.03, P = 0.76) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Urine sediments from 20 of 100 patients contained pTECs, evidenced by cytokeratin 18 positivity, while healthy control subjects (n = 50) showed none (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Activated NF-kappaB could be detected in the nuclear region of excreted pTECs in 8 of 20 patients with pTECs in the urine sediment (40%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five of eight NF-kappaBp65 antigen-positive cells stained positive for interleukin-6 (IL-6) antigen (62%), while only one of the NF-kappaB-negative cells showed IL-6 positivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>pTECs in the urine sediment correlated positively with <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> (r = 0.57, P &lt; 0.0001) and <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> excretion (r = 0.55, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry in diabetic rat kidneys and a human diabetic kidney confirmed strong expression of NF-kappaB in tubular cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>To further prove an AGE/<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>-induced NF-kappaB activation in pTECs, NF-kappaB activation was studied in cultured human pTECs by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Stimulation of NF-kappaB binding activity was dose dependent and was one-half maximal at 250 nmol/l AGE-albumin or <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> and time dependent at a maximum of activation after 4 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Functional relevance of the observed NF-kappaB activation was demonstrated in pTECs transfected with a NF-kappaB-driven luciferase reporter plasmid and was associated with an increased release of IL-6 into the supernatant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The AGE- and <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>-dependent activation of NF-kappaBp65 and NF-kappaB-dependent IL-6 expression could be inhibited using the soluble form of the receptor for AGEs (RAGE) (soluble RAGE [sRAGE]), RAGE-specific antibody, or the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30314">thioctic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In addition transcriptional activity and IL-6 release from transfected cells could be inhibited by overexpression of the NF-kappaB-specific inhibitor kappaBalpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The findings that excreted pTECs demonstrate activated NF-kappaB and IL-6 antigen and that AGE-albumin and <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> lead to a perpetuated activation of NF-kappaB in vitro infer that a perpetuated increase in proinflammtory gene products, such as IL-6, plays a role in damaging the renal tubule </plain></SENT>
