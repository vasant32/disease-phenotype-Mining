<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effect of a 2-week treatment with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">nifedipine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3380">captopril</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8364">prazosin</z:chebi> upon glycaemia, serum insulin (IRI) and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (CP) following oral and intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> load were investigated in three groups, each including 10 non-diabetic patients with essential <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (h) and 10 hypertensive type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetics (h + d), aged 32-63 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">Nifedipine</z:chebi> produced increase in glycaemia in the oral test in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the (h) group, but not in the (h + d) group, the drug caused reduction of the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent increases in serum IRI and CP, more marked with respect to CP, as expressed by the decrease in the molar serum CP/IRI ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that in non-diabetic patients, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">nifedipine</z:chebi> reduces the early response of beta-cells to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, but this effect is partly compensated by a decreased insulin uptake by the liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, this phenomenon does not become manifest because of absence or reduction in the early <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent insulin release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3380">captopril</z:chebi>, lower values of glycaemia and serum IRI and CP were observed in both groups suggesting an improvement of insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">nifedipine</z:chebi> has a small influence, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3380">captopril</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8364">prazosin</z:chebi> are devoided of any influence on the secretory function of pancreatic beta-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These drugs may be recommended for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in patients with type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
