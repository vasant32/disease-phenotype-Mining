<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi>, which improves insulin sensitivity and lowers plasma insulin levels in insulin-resistant <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects and patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, would also lower circulating PAI-1 antigen concentrations and activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed insulin sensitivity (5-h, 80 mU x m(-2) x min(-1) hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp) and measured plasma PAI-1 antigen and activities and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) in 14 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 20 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects (10 lean, 10 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>) before and after 3 months of treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> (600 mg/day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At baseline, plasma PAI-1 antigen levels after an overnight fast were significantly higher in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (33.5 +/- 4.7 microg/l) and type 2 diabetic subjects (54.9 +/- 6.3 microg/l) than in the lean control subjects (16.3 +/- 3.2 microg/l; P &lt; 0.01 and P &lt; 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">Troglitazone</z:chebi> decreased plasma PAI-1 antigen concentrations in the diabetic patients (36.8 +/- 5.0 microg/l; P &lt; 0.001 vs. baseline), but the reduction in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects did not reach statistical significance (baseline, 33.5 +/- 4.7; after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi>, 25.6 +/- 5.2 microg/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Changes in plasma PAI-1 activity paralleled those of PAI-1 antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The extent of the reduction in plasma PAI-1 antigen concentrations in the diabetic patients after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> correlated with the reductions in fasting plasma insulin (r = 0.60, P &lt; 0.05), nonesterified fatty acid (r = 0.63, P &lt; 0.02), and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations (r = 0.64, P &lt; 0.02) but not with the improvement in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal rates during the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> clamps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three nonresponders to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> with respect to effects on insulin sensitivity and fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin levels also had no reduction in circulating PAI-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> enhances fibrinolytic system activity in insulin-resistant type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This effect appears to be intimately linked to its potential to lower plasma insulin levels and improve glycemic control through its peripheral tissue insulin-sensitizing effects </plain></SENT>
