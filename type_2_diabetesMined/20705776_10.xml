<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The objective of this research is to gain a greater understanding of the cause of fasting and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011998'>postprandial hyperglycemia</z:hpo> in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endogenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production is excessive before eating and fails to appropriately suppress after eating in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is due in part to impaired insulin-induced suppression of endogenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production, which is observed early in the evolution of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Increased rates of gluconeogenesis and perhaps glycogenolysis contribute to hepatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Insulin-induced stimulation of hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake and hepatic <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthesis are reduced in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> primarily due to decreased uptake of extracellular <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> presumably because of inadequate activation of hepatic glucokinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Delayed insulin secretion results in higher peak <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations particularly when suppression of glucagon is impaired, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> prolongs the duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, which can be marked when both hepatic and extra-hepatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> are present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The premise of these studies, as well as those performed by many other investigators, is that an understanding of the pathogenesis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> will enable the development of targeted therapies that are directed toward correcting specific metabolic defects in a given individual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>I, as well as many other investigators, believe that such therapies are likely to be more effective and to have a lower risk than would occur if everyone were treated the same regardless of the underlying cause of their <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>While we do not yet have sufficient knowledge to truly individualize therapy, in my opinion this approach will be the norm in the not too distant future </plain></SENT>
