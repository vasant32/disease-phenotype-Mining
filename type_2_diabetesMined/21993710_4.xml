<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48416">olmesartan</z:chebi>, an ARB, on primary composite outcome of doubling of serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>endstage renal disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in type 2 diabetic patients with overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Secondary outcome included composite cardiovascular outcomes, changes in renal function and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Randomisation and allocation to trial group were carried out by a central computer system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Participants, caregivers, the people carrying out examinations and people assessing the outcomes were blinded to group assignment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five hundred and seventy-seven (377 Japanese, 200 Chinese) patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> therapy (73.5% [n = 424] received concomitant ACEI), were given either once-daily <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48416">olmesartan</z:chebi> (10-40 mg) (n = 288) or placebo (n = 289) over 3.2 ± 0.6 years (mean±SD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48416">olmesartan</z:chebi> group, 116 developed the primary outcome (41.1%) compared with 129 (45.4%) in the placebo group (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.75, 1.24; p = 0.791) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="48416">Olmesartan</z:chebi> significantly decreased blood pressure, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> and rate of change of reciprocal serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was higher in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48416">olmesartan</z:chebi> group than the placebo group (ten vs three cases), whereas major adverse cardiovascular events (cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> plus non-fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were similar between the two groups (major adverse cardiovascular events 18 vs 21 cases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>; 19 vs 20 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hyperkalaemia was more frequent in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48416">olmesartan</z:chebi> group than the placebo group (9.2% vs 5.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48416">Olmesartan</z:chebi> was well tolerated but did not improve renal outcome on top of ACEI </plain></SENT>
