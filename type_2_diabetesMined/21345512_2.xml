<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: The combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitor has been shown to be an effective, safe, and well-tolerated treatment for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated β-cell function and morphological changes in islets in <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats following combined therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and investigated the expression of potentially relevant genes using cDNA microarrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nine-week-old ZDF rats were randomly divided into four treatment groups: no treatment (control); <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi>; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 5 weeks of treatment, an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test was performed and plasma levels of active GLP-1 and islet <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and gene expression were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Combination therapy reduced fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and postprandial plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels and increased active GLP-1 levels, compared with monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Combination therapy also <z:mp ids='MP_0003058'>increased insulin secretion</z:mp>, the proportion of small islets, and the intensity of insulin staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it increased the expression of genes involved in cell survival and growth and downregulated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-associated genes, relative to monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Combination treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> preserved β-cell function and β-cell integrity in ZDF rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This may be associated with the transcriptional activation of anti-apoptotic and pro-survival genes, as well as the suppression of pro-apoptotic genes </plain></SENT>
