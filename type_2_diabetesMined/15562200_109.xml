<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the 12- and 52-week efficacy of the dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor LAF237 versus placebo in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> continuing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 107 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with a 40-week extension in those completing the core study and agreeing, together with the investigator, to extend treatment to 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Placebo (n=51) or LAF237 (50 mg once daily, n=56) was added to ongoing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> treatment (1,500-3,000 mg/day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HbA1c and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) were measured periodically, and standardized meal tests were performed at baseline, week 12, and week 52 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In patients randomized to LAF237, baseline HbA1c averaged 7.7 +/- 0.1% and decreased at week 12 (Delta=-0.6 +/- 0.1%), whereas HbA1c did not change from a baseline of 7.9 +/- 0.1% in patients given placebo (between-group difference in DeltaHbA1c=-0.7 +/- 0.1%, P &lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean prandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and FPG were significantly reduced in patients receiving LAF237 versus placebo by 2.2 +/- 0.4 mmol/l (P &lt;0.0001) and 1.2 +/- 0.4 mmol/l (P=0.0057), respectively, but plasma insulin levels were not affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At end point of the extension, the between-group differences in change in mean prandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, and FPG were -2.4 +/- 0.6 mmol/l (P=0.0001), 40 +/- 16 pmol/l (P=0.0153), and -1.1 +/- 0.5 mmol/l (P=0.0312), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HbA1c did not change from week 12 to week 52 in LAF237-treated patients (n=42) but increased in participants given placebo (n=29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The between-group difference in DeltaHbA1c after 1 year was -1.1 +/- 0.2% (P &lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Data from this study demonstrate that LAF237 effectively prevents deterioration of glycemic control when added to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
