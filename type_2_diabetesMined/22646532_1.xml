<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Due to the increasing prevalence of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM), the emergent trend towards diagnosis in younger patients and the progressive nature of this disease, many more patients than before now require insulin to maintain glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there is a degree of inertia among physicians and patients regarding the initiation and intensification of insulin therapy, in part due to concerns about the associated <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> and increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> (GLP-1RAs) increase insulin release and suppress glucagon secretion in a <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent manner, thus conferring glycaemic control with a low incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>GLP-1RAs also promote <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, and have beneficial effects on markers of Î² cell function, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels, blood pressure and cardiovascular risk markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the durability of their effectiveness is unknown and, compared with insulin, the antihyperglycaemic efficacy of GLP-1RAs is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The combination of a GLP-1RA and insulin might thus be highly effective for optimal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control, ameliorating the adverse effects typically associated with insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data from clinical studies support the therapeutic potential of GLP-1RA-insulin combination therapy, typically showing beneficial effects on glycaemic control and body weight, with a low incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> and, in established insulin therapy, facilitating reductions in insulin dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this review, the physiological and pharmacological rationale for using GLP-1RA and insulin therapies in combination is discussed, and data from clinical studies that have assessed the efficacy and safety of this treatment strategy are outlined </plain></SENT>
