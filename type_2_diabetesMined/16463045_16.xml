<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Meta-analyses could only be performed for total mortality, mortality from CHD, and CHD incidence, because the availability of articles on other complications was too limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A PubMed search through to September 2005 was performed and the reference lists of relevant articles examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the relevant articles there were six cohort studies reporting on the risk of total mortality and/or fatal and/or incident CHD in alcohol non-consumers and in at least two groups of alcohol consumers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Statistical pooling showed lower risks in alcohol consumers than in non-consumers (the reference category) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relative risk (RR) of total mortality was 0.64 (95% CI 0.49-0.82) in the &lt;6 g/day category </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the higher alcohol consumption categories (6 to &lt;18, and &gt; or =18 g/day), the RRs of total mortality were not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Risks of fatal and total CHD were significantly lower in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three categories of alcohol consumers (&lt;6, 6 to &lt;18 and &gt; or =18 g/day) than in non-consumers, with RRs ranging from 0.34 to 0.75 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: This meta-analysis shows that, as with findings in the general population, moderate alcohol consumption is associated with a lower risk of mortality and CHD in type 2 diabetic populations </plain></SENT>
