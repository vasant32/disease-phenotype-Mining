<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data sources included MEDLINE and EMBASE between 2001 and 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a search for articles containing mean or geometric mean values of FSI in East Asian subjects with NGT, IGR, or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Monte Carlo method was used for simulation of the mean and standard deviation of individual measures in each ethnic group; calculation of the median ratio and 95% confidence interval of individual measures between ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-two articles fully met our pre-determined criteria and were included in the meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results of the meta-analysis revealed that FSI level is significantly lower in Japanese subjects with NGT, IGR, or T2DM than in Korean and Chinese subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Ethnic difference in FSI level between East Asians was observed in not only T2DM patients but also subjects with NGT or IGR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The lower FSI level in Japanese subjects was accompanied by lower <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that ethnic difference in dietary habit was one of the most influential factors for the ethnic difference in FSI </plain></SENT>
