<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Forearm perfusion studies were carried out to determine the responsiveness to insulin of the superficial forearm tissues in non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetics, and the interrelationships among plasma concentrations of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin and non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), tissue uptake of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin and tissue release of NEFA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was found that: (1) in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, uptake of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was dependent on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was also dependent on insulin concentration in the range of 0-30 mU/l, but not over a wider range of insulin concentration (less than 66 mU/l), indicating that the insulin effect was maximal at approximately 30 mU/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake in diabetics was independent of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration but dependent on insulin uptake over an insulin concentration range up to 140 mU/l; <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake reached the same levels as in control subjects but only at higher concentration and higher uptake of insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(2) Insulin uptake was directly dependent on insulin concentration and the regression coefficients were very similar in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(3) NEFA concentration fell to comparable levels in the two groups of subjects in response to insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that in Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>: (1) the superficial forearm tissues show decreased responsiveness to the stimulatory effect of both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020459" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperinsulinaemia</z:e> on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization but the NEFA-lowering effect of insulin is undiminished, and (2) tissue uptake of insulin is <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, despite the decrease in receptor capacity that has been demonstrated by others </plain></SENT>
