<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This is a part of the Japan <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Diabetic Complications</z:e> Study (JDCS), a multi-centred randomised trial of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients aged 40-70 years with an 8 year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 1,221 patients without diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> at baseline; incidence of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> was defined as the development of any diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 410 patients with mild non-proliferative diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> at baseline; progression of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> was defined as the development of severe non-proliferative diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> or proliferative diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used multivariate proportional Cox hazard models, and generalised additive models were also applied to identify potential threshold effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidence and progression rate of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> was 38.3/1,000 person-years and 21.1/1,000 person-years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Higher HbA(1c) (adjusted HR [aHR] per 1% [10.9 mmol/mol] 1.36 [95% CI 1.28-1.45]), longer duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (aHR per 5 year period 1.26 [95% CI 1.17-1.35]), higher systolic blood pressure (aHR per +10 mmHg 1.01 [95% CI 1.00-1.02]) and higher body mass index (aHR per 1 kg/m(2) 1.05 [95% CI 1.00-1.09]) were associated with incident diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The association between HbA(1c) and incident diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> was linear; the association with duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> increased rapidly between 5 and 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Higher HbA(1c) was also associated with progression of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (aHR per 1% [10.9 mmol/mol] 1.66 [95% CI 1.41-1.96]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Observed incidence and progression rates of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> seemed lower than that in western populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>HbA(1c) was the only factor associated with both incidence and progression of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The strength of the association between duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and incidence of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> increased rapidly during a period of 5 to 10 years duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
