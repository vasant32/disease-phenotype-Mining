<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective analysis of data collected at primary care (except ANDIAB--secondary care) [corrected] matched for age, gender and disease duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Measurements included participants' characteristics, performance frequency of clinical-metabolic process indicators, and percentage of clinical-metabolic outcomes at recommended target values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The weighted mean of the percentage of process performance was within 68 to 81%; that of outcomes at target dropped to 29 to 45% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although statistically significant, differences among groups were far from those in healthcare budgets, and probably only of marginal clinical impact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The percentage of patients with low, slight or high coronary risk was similar in the three groups, with most people at high or very high risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite the high difference in health per capita investment and system characteristics among countries, the study populations had striking similarities regarding the low percentage of participants who achieved <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factor</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treatment goals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, differences in health budget and system characteristics would not be the main drivers in care quality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> education at every level and quality care registries would contribute to improve this situation and assess such improvement </plain></SENT>
