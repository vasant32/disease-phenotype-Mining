<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: HbA1c levels can be reduced in populations of diabetic patients, but some individuals may exhibit little improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To search for reasons underlying differences in HbA1c outcome, we analyzed patients managed in an outpatient <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: African-Americans with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were categorized as responders, intermediate responders or poor responders according to their HbA1c level after 1 year of care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Logistical regression was used to determine baseline characteristics that distinguished poor responders from responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic strategies were examined for each of the response categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 447 patients had a mean age and disease duration of 58 and 5 years, respectively, and BMI of 32 kg/m2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, the mean HbA1c level fell from 9.6 to 8.1% after 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean HbA1c levels improved from 8.8 to 6.2% in responders, and from 9.5 to 7.9% in intermediate responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In poor responders, the average HbA1c level was 10.8% on presentation and 10.9% at 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The odds of being a poor responder were significantly increased with longer disease duration, higher initial HbA1c level, and greater BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although doses of oral agents and insulin were significantly higher among poor responders at most visits, the acceleration of insulin therapy did not occur until late in the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Clinical <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> programs need to devise methods to identify patients who are at risk for persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Whereas patient characteristics explain some <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of HbA1c outcome (and may aid in earlier identification of patients who potentially may not respond to conventional treatment), insufficient intensification of therapy may also be a component underlying the failure to achieve glycemic goals </plain></SENT>
