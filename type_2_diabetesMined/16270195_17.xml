<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examines the effect of fetal and neonatal exposure to <z:chebi fb="164" ids="18723">nicotine</z:chebi>, the major addictive component of cigarettes, on postnatal growth, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Female Wistar rats were given either saline (vehicle) or <z:chebi fb="164" ids="18723">nicotine</z:chebi> (1 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) during pregnancy and lactation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum and pancreas tissue were collected from the infant rats at birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Postnatal growth was assessed weekly until the rats reached 26 weeks of age and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis was examined by OGTTs performed at 7 and 26 weeks of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Exposure to <z:chebi fb="164" ids="18723">nicotine</z:chebi> resulted in increased postnatal growth and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="164" ids="18723">Nicotine</z:chebi> exposure also resulted in dysglycaemia at 7 and 26 weeks of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum insulin concentrations were decreased in the pups exposed to <z:chebi fb="164" ids="18723">nicotine</z:chebi> at birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This was associated with increased beta cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> (pups of saline-treated mothers 8.8+/-1.21% apoptotic beta cells; pups of <z:chebi fb="164" ids="18723">nicotine</z:chebi>-treated mothers 27.8+/-3.1% apoptotic beta cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Fetal and neonatal exposure to <z:chebi fb="164" ids="18723">nicotine</z:chebi> results in metabolic changes in the offspring that are consistent with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We propose that these metabolic changes may be a consequence of the initial insult to the beta cell during fetal life and that this animal model has many characteristics of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in humans </plain></SENT>
