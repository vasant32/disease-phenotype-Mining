<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>How this cognitive profile evolves over time is uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study aims to provide detailed information on the evolution of cognitive decrements in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-eight patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 38 controls matched for age, sex and estimated IQ performed an elaborate neuropsychological examination in 2002-2004 and again in 2006-2008, including 11 tasks covering five cognitive domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vascular and metabolic determinants were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data were analysed with repeated measures analysis of variance, including main effects for group, time and the group x time interaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> showed moderate decrements in information-processing speed (mean difference in z scores [95% CI] -0.37 [-0.69, -0.05]) and attention and executive functions (-0.25 [-0.49, -0.01]) compared with controls at both the baseline and the 4 year follow-up examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 4 years both groups showed a decline in abstract reasoning (-0.16 [-0.30, -0.02]) and attention and executive functioning (-0.29 [-0.40, -0.17]), but there was no evidence for accelerated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> in the patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> as compared with controls (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, cognitive decrements are moderate in size and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> over 4 years is largely within the range of what can be viewed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ageing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Apparently, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1392786" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive changes</z:e> develop slowly over a prolonged period of time </plain></SENT>
