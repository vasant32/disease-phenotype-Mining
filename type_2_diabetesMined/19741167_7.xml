<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (GLP)-1 is a regulatory <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> synthesized in the gut and the brain that plays an important role in the regulation of food intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both GLP-1 and exendin (Ex)-4, a long-acting GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1r) <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, reduce food intake when administered intracerebroventricularly, whereas Ex4 is much more potent at suppressing food intake when given peripherally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has generally been hypothesized that this difference is due to the relative pharmacokinetic profiles of GLP-1 and Ex4, but it is possible that the two <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> control feeding via distinct mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this study, the anorectic effects of intracerebroventricular GLP-1 and Ex4, and the sensitivity of these effects to GLP-1r antagonism, were compared in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, the GLP-1r dependence of the anorectic effect of intracerebroventricular Ex4 was assessed in GLP-1r(-/-) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Intracerebroventricular Ex4 was 100-fold more potent than GLP-1 at reducing food intake, and this effect was insensitive to GLP-1r antagonism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, GLP-1r antagonists completely blocked the anorectic effect of intraperitoneal Ex4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite the insensitivity of intracerebroventricular Ex4 to GLP-1r antagonism, intracerebroventricular Ex4 failed to reduce food intake in GLP-1r(-/-) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that although GLP-1rs are required for the actions of Ex4, there appear to be key differences in how GLP-1 and Ex4 interact with central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system GLP-1r and in how Ex4 interacts with GLP-1r in the brain versus the periphery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A better understanding of these unique differences may lead to expansion and/or improvement of GLP-1-based therapies for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
