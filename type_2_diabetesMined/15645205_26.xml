<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study was based on 4,140 men and 4,129 women (aged 25-74 years) who participated in one of the three MONICA Augsburg surveys between 1984 and 1995, and who were free of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Incident cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were assessed using a follow-up questionnaire in 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Gender specific hazard ratios were estimated from Cox proportional hazard models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 119 cases of incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among men and 69 among women were registered during the mean follow-up period of 7.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In both sexes, difficulty maintaining sleep was associated with a higher risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for age, survey, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e>, parental history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001681'>angina pectoris</z:hpo>, regular smoking, physical activity, alcohol intake, body mass index and education, the hazard ratio in men was 1.60 (95% CI: 1.05-2.45) and the hazard ratio in women was 1.98 (95% CI: 1.20-3.29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, difficulty initiating sleep was not associated with a significantly increased risk of developing type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> after multivariable adjustment in both sexes in the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Difficulty maintaining sleep was associated with an increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in men and women from the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although, the causal pathway is not entirely clear, it seems that both <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> low-grade systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> may be involved </plain></SENT>
