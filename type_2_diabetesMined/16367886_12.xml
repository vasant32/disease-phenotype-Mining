<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: A thorough understanding of the mechanisms of adipocyte differentiation and metabolism is important for the prevention and/or treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and its complications, including type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A complex role for <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandins</z:chebi> (PGs) in adipogenesis is suggested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the expression and cellular localization of enzymes in the cyclooxygenase (COX) cascade that synthesize PGs as well as the PG profile as a function of differentiation status in 3T3-L1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Murine 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were used as a model for studies of adipocyte differentiation induced by a hormone cocktail and compared with the parental fibroblastic line NIH 3T3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both cell lines were incubated in maintenance medium or differentiation medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine days after differentiation, the expression of enzymes in the COX cascade was evaluated by immunoblot analysis, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunocytochemistry, and PG formation was examined using enzyme immunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A differentiation-dependent diminution of COX-1 and COX-2 mRNA and cognate proteins in 3T3-L1 cells was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PG release, including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2), 6-keto <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26340">PGF</z:chebi>(1alpha), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26337">PGD</z:chebi>(2) and 15d-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26346">PGJ</z:chebi>(2), significantly decreased following differentiation in 3T3-L1 cells (anova/Tukey, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, microsomal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi> synthase (mPGES) and lipocalin-type <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26337">PGD</z:chebi> synthase (L-PGDS) were selectively upregulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Immunocytochemistry revealed that COX-1 and COX-2 became intracellularly more diffuse upon differentiation, whereas mPGES was redistributed to the nuclear compartment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Regulation of PG formation and COX-2 expression in 3T3-L1 cells is differentiation-dependent and involves changes in the levels of gene expression of the individual isoforms as well as redistribution of the enzymes within cellular compartments </plain></SENT>
