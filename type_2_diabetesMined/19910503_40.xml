<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of publications using MEDLINE (1955-April 2009), EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library and manual searches without language restrictions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We included studies if they were prospective with follow-up &gt;3 years and had an assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002360'>sleep disturbances</z:hpo> at baseline and incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We recorded several characteristics for each study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We extracted quantity and quality of sleep, how they were assessed, and incident cases defined with different validated methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We extracted relative risks (RRs) and 95% CI and pooled them using random-effects models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We performed sensitivity analysis and assessed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> and publication bias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We included 10 studies (13 independent cohort samples; 107,756 male and female participants, follow-up range 4.2-32 years, and 3,586 incident cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In pooled analyses, quantity and quality of sleep predicted the risk of development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For short duration of sleep (&lt; or =5-6 h/night), the RR was 1.28 (95% CI 1.03-1.60, P = 0.024, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> P = 0.015); for long duration of sleep (&gt;8-9 h/night), the RR was 1.48 (1.13-1.96, P = 0.005); for difficulty in initiating sleep, the RR was 1.57 (1.25-1.97, P &lt; 0.0001); and for difficulty in maintaining sleep, the RR was 1.84 (1.39-2.43, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Quantity and quality of sleep consistently and significantly predict the risk of the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms underlying this relation may differ between short and long sleepers </plain></SENT>
