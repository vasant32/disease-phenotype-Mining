<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Study subjects were 99 patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> aged over 20 years who were judged to require insulin therapy due to poor <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control (HbA1c level of &gt; or =7.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BIAsp 30 dosage was determined by the patient's attending physician; coadministration of hypotensive agents and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35679">antilipemic</z:chebi> agents was permitted, but OAD coadministration was limited to patients already receiving such drugs at the start of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients who did not achieve HbA1c &lt;6.5% after 16+/-5 weeks with QD (Phase 1) were stepped up to BID (Phase 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>If patients still had not achieved HbA1c &lt;6.5% after 16+/-5 weeks with BID, they were stepped up to TID (Phase 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>55 of the 99 enrolled subjects completed the study and the rates of achievement of HbA1c &lt;6.5% and HbA1c &lt;7.0% were 45.5% and 74.5%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> registered subjects, 5.1% (5/99) achieved HbA1c &lt;6.5% in QD, 19.5% (16/82) in BID, and 20.6% (7/34) in TID </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Statistically significant reductions in HbA1c levels were recorded at the conclusion of each phase, with no incidents requiring intervention, indicating that BIAsp 30 step-up therapy is a safe, simple therapy that can be useful in achieving better glycemic control for Japanese patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
