<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to generate normative values for periods of euglycemia as well as for daily patterns of glycemic excursions in patients with type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> monitored continuously for a maximum period of 21 days and blinded to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a multicenter, prospective observational study in which 101 consecutive patients with type 1 (n = 60) or type 2 (n = 41) <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> underwent blinded continuous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> measurements were divided into periods of euglycemia (70-180 mg/dl), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> (&gt;180 mg/dl), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> (&lt;70 mg/dl) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The proportions of time patients were hypoglycemic, euglycemic, and hyperglycemic and the total areas under the curves (AUCs) were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the observation period the 101 subjects contributed an average 287 +/- 132 h of continuous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subjects remained in the euglycemic range for approximately 63% of the total day, were hypoglycemic 8%, and were hyperglycemic 29% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>Hypoglycemia</z:hpo> was more prevalent nocturnally (11 vs. 7%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> diurnally (31 vs. 25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, type 1 diabetic subjects had more frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001988'>hypoglycemic episodes</z:hpo> per day (2.1 vs. 1.0; P &lt; 0.001) that were of longer duration (1.1 vs. 0.7 h; P &lt; 0.0001), reflecting a greater number of hours per day in the hypoglycemic range (2.3 vs. 1.0 h; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean hypoglycemic AUC values were &gt;150% higher for type 1 compared with type 2 diabetic subjects (41 vs. 16, respectively; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These normative data will assist in study and sample size planning for future investigations of continuous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring and allow for qualitative comparisons with trials of therapeutic interventions aimed at reducing the occurrence of glycemic excursions </plain></SENT>
