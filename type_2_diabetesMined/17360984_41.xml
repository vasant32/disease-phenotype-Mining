<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that this impairment is due to a defect at the receptor level induced by the diabetic state, particularly <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Gene expression of incretin receptors, GLP-1R and GIPR, were significantly decreased in islets of 90% pancreatectomized (Px) hyperglycemic rats, with recovery when <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were normalized by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8113">phlorizin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Perifused islets isolated from hyperglycemic Px rats showed reduced insulin responses to GLP-1 and GIP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To examine the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> on incretin receptor expression, a hyperglycemic clamp study was performed for 96 h with reduction of GLP-1 receptor expression but increase in GIP receptor expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similar findings were found when islets were cultured at high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations for 48 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The reduction of GLP-1 receptor expression by high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was prevented by dominant-negative protein kinase C (PKC)alpha overexpression, whereas GLP-1 receptor expression was reduced with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> PKCalpha overexpression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taken together, GLP-1 and GIP receptor expression is decreased with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, and this decrease likely contributes to the impaired incretin effects found in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
