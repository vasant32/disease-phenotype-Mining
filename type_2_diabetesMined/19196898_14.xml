<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: African American (n = 1,703; aged 60 +/- 10 years) and Caucasian (n = 1,445; aged 62 +/- 10 years) men with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> completed a maximal exercise test between 1986 and 2007 at the Veterans Affairs Medical Centers in Washington, DC, and Palo Alto, California </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three fitness categories were established (low-, moderate-, and high-fit) based on peak METs achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects were followed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality for 7.3 +/- 4.7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The adjusted mortality risk was 23% higher in African Americans than in Caucasians (hazard ratio 1.23 [95% CI 1.1-1.4]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A graded reduction in mortality risk was noted with increased exercise capacity for both races </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a significant interaction between race and METs (P &lt; 0.001) and among race and fitness categories (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The association was stronger for Caucasians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Each 1-MET increase in exercise capacity yielded a 19% lower risk for Caucasians and 14% for African Americans (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the risk was 43% lower (0.57 [0.44-0.73]) for moderate-fit and 67% lower (0.33 [0.22-0.48]) for high-fit Caucasians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The comparable reductions in African Americans were 34% (0.66 [0.55-0.80]) and 46% (0.54 [0.39-0.73]), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Exercise capacity is a strong predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality in African American and Caucasian men with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The exercise capacity-related reduction in mortality appears to be stronger and more graded for Caucasians than for African Americans </plain></SENT>
