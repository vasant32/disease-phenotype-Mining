<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Physical activity reduces high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>), and total mortality in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is not known whether the effects of physical activity on mortality depend on the levels of hs-CRP in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We prospectively followed-up on 569 type 2 diabetic patients, aged 45-64 years, who were free of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Participants were stratified according to the level of hs-CRP (&lt;1.0, 1.0-3.0, or &gt;3.0 mg/L) and the degree of physical activity (0-4 metabolic equivalent tasks [METs] or &gt;4 METs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the joint association between physical activity and hs-CRP levels and the risk of mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During an 18-year follow-up, 356 patients died, 217 of whom died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Those who were physically more active had significantly reduced total, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> (CHD) mortality among patients with elevated hs-CRP levels (&gt;3 mg/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings persisted in multivariable analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, in patients with an hs-CRP level&lt;1 mg/L or between 1 and 3 mg/L, there was no statistically significant relationship between physical activity and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> or CHD mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Physical activity reduces total, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>, and CHD mortality in type 2 diabetic patients with elevated hs-CRP levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the anti-inflammatory effect of physical activity may counteract increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> and CHD morbidity and mortality associated with high CRP levels </plain></SENT>
