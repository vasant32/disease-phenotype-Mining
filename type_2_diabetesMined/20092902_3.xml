<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study included 464 subjects: 269 patients with T2D and 195 healthy controls in South Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We genotyped subjects for four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs): ENPP1 K121Q, ENPP1 A/G+1044TGA, MMP3 -709A&gt;G and MMP3 -1475G&gt;A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence or absence of calcifications in the aortic arch was assessed by plain chest radiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The SNPs ENPP1 K121Q and MMP3 -709A&gt;G showed significant associations with T2D (P=0.001 and P=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The SNP ENPP1 K121Q showed a significant association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005303'>aortic arch calcification</z:hpo> in T2D (P=0.036) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum OPG levels were significantly higher in T2D patients than in the control group (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, serum MMP3 levels were significantly lower in T2D patients than in the control group (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that the ENPP1 K121Q and MMP3 -709A&gt;G polymorphisms are associated with T2D, and that the ENPP1 Q allele is associated with increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0005303'>aortic arch calcification</z:hpo> in a Korean population </plain></SENT>
