<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is associated with increased cardiovascular risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The role of aggressive glycemic control in preventing cardiovascular events is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A nested case-control study design was used to evaluate the association between average A1C and cardiovascular outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were identified among members of Kaiser Permanente Southern California </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was identified based on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9 diagnosis codes and either A1C &gt;7.5% or prescriptions for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Case subjects were defined based on nonfatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, nonfatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> attributed to cardiovascular events during a 3-year window </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> control subjects were matched to each case subject based on age, sex, and index date for the corresponding case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A conditional logistic regression model was used to estimate the odds ratio of cardiovascular events and compare three patient groups based on average A1C measured in the preindex period (≤6, &gt;6-8, &gt;8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 44,628 control subjects were matched to 11,157 case subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with an average A1C ≤6% were 20% more likely to experience a cardiovascular event than the group with an average A1C of &gt;6-8% (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with an average A1C &gt;8% experienced a 16% increase in the likelihood of a cardiovascular event (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We found evidence of statistical interaction with A1C category and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> level (P = 0.0002), use of cardiovascular medications (P = 0.02), and use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35476">antipsychotics</z:chebi> (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High-risk patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who achieved mean A1C levels of ≤6% or failed to decrease their A1C to &lt;8% are at increased risk for cardiovascular events </plain></SENT>
