<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IAPP content was increased in the islets of VMH-lesioned rats compared with findings in the sham-operated controls (100.9 +/- 6.6 vs 72.8 +/- 3.85 fmol/islet; P less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Isolated islets of VMH-lesioned rats secreted larger amounts of IAPP in the presence of 2.8 and 16.7 mM <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (2.99 +/- 0.98 and 11.2 +/- 0.29 fmol islet-1 3 h-1) than was noted in sham-operated rats (ND and 6.65 +/- 0.78 fmol islet-1 3 h-1) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The isolated islets secreted larger amounts of IAPP in response to 2.8 and 16.7 mM <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (2.83 +/- 0.88 and 15.81 +/- 1.35 fmol islet-1 3 h-1) than did those from lean control rats (0.36 +/- 0.19 and 12.49 +/- 1.20 fmol islet-1 3 h-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results strongly suggest that overproduction and hypersecretion of IAPP occur in animals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
