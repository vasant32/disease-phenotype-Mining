<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to evaluate the effects of the variants in KCNQ1 on type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and metabolic traits in the population of mainland China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped in 1,912 individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 2,041 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls using the ligase detection reaction method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We confirmed the association of KCNQ1 with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the population of mainland China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Allele frequency ORs of the three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were: rs2237892 (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.08-1.31, p = 3.0 x 10(-4)); rs2237895 (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.09-1.32, p = 1.9 x 10(-4)); and rs2237897 (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.13-1.36, p = 3.9 x 10(-5)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also found a significant difference in the distribution of the global haplotypes between the type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> group and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control group (p = 2.6 x 10(-5)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, in the control group SNP rs2237892 was marginally associated with increasing fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and SNPs rs2237892 and rs2237897 were associated with HbA(1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three variants, homozygous carriers of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-associated allele had significantly <z:mp ids='MP_0006086'>decreased BMI</z:mp> and waist circumferences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our investigation confirmed the effects of KCNQ1 variants on type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk in the Chinese population </plain></SENT>
