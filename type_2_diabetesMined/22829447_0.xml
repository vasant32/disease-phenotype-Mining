<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo> is known to increase Aβ generation, but the underlying mechanism that links <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> to increased Aβ generation is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the effect of high-fat diet-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> on amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing in mouse brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that the induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> promoted Aβ generation in the brain via altered insulin signal transduction, increased β- and γ-secretase activities, and accumulation of autophagosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings were confirmed in diabetic db/db mice brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in vitro experiments in insulin-resistant SH-SY5Y cells and primary cortical neurons confirmed the alteration of APP processing by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>-induced autophagosome accumulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Defects in insulin signal transduction affect autophagic flux by inhibiting the mammalian target of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> pathway, resulting in altered APP processing in these cell culture systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> that underlies the pathogenesis of T2DM might also trigger accumulation of autophagosomes, leading to increased Aβ generation, which might be involved in the pathogenesis of AD </plain></SENT>
