<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 299 patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> participated in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>Retinopathy</z:hpo> was assessed by 7-field stereo fundus photography and was graded according to the ETDRS scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum anti-pericyte autoantibodies were detected by immunofluorescence on tissue cultured bovine <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> pericytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of anti-pericyte autoantibodies in Type 2 diabetic patients was 54% and was approximately equal in men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence was approximately 55% with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> at grades from 10 to 53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At grades above 53 the prevalence declined to 23% ( p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The highest prevalence by duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 70%, was found at 0 to 5 years and the lowest, 25% at more than 25 years duration ( p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: Anti-pericyte autoantibodies are present at high prevalence in Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Their presence during earlier stages of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> could be due to a reaction with antigens expressed by "activated" pericytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The decline in antibody prevalence in advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> could mark pericyte loss and progression to an angiogenic <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> milieu </plain></SENT>
