<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical testing for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> in Alström syndrome and matched young-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 diabetic subjects was therefore undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Fifty-eight subjects with Alström syndrome (18 insulin-resistant nondiabetic and 40 diabetic; aged 8-43 years) and 30 young-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> diabetic subjects (aged 13-35 years) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Neuropathy</z:e> symptom questionnaires were administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Graded monofilament and 128-MHz tuning fork vibration perception were assessed in both feet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Neuropathic symptoms, loss of monofilament, and/or vibration perception were reported by 12 of the 30 young-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 diabetic subjects (6 had neuropathic ulceration) but none of the subjects with Alström syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The striking preservation of protective foot sensation in Alström syndrome may provide a clue to the causes of differential susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> in the wider diabetic population </plain></SENT>
