<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we showed that induction of hepatic Est is a common feature of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Loss of Est in female mice improved metabolic function in ob/ob, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi>-, and high-fat diet-induced mouse models of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The metabolic benefit of Est ablation included improved body composition, <z:mp ids='MP_0004889'>increased energy expenditure</z:mp> and insulin sensitivity, and decreased hepatic gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This metabolic benefit appeared to have resulted from decreased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> deprivation and increased estrogenic activity in the liver, whereas such benefit was abolished in ovariectomized mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the effect of Est was sex-specific, as Est ablation in ob/ob males exacerbated the diabetic phenotype, which was accounted for by the decreased islet β-cell mass and failure of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The loss of β-cell mass in ob/ob males deficient in Est was associated with increased macrophage infiltration and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in white adipose tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results revealed an essential role of EST in energy metabolism and the pathogenesis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of EST, at least in females, may represent a novel approach to manage type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
