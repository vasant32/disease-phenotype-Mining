<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: FTO gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been shown to be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-related traits and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several small studies have suggested a greater than expected effect of the FTO rs9939609 SNP on weight in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000147'>polycystic ovary</z:hpo> syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCOS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore aimed to examine the impact of FTO genotype on BMI and weight in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCOS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A systematic search of medical databases (PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane CENTRAL) was conducted up to the end of April 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven studies describing eight distinct <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCOS</z:e> cohorts were retrieved; seven were genotyped for SNP rs9939609 and one for SNP rs1421085 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The per allele effect on BMI and body weight increase was calculated and subjected to meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 2,548 women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCOS</z:e> were included in the study; 762 were TT homozygotes, 1,253 had an AT/CT genotype, and 533 were AA/CC homozygotes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Each additional copy of the effect allele (A/C) increased the BMI by a mean of 0.19 z score units (95% CI 0.13, 0.24; p = 2.26 × 10(-11)) and body weight by a mean of 0.20 z score units (95% CI 0.14, 0.26; p = 1.02 × 10(-10)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This translated into an approximately 3.3 kg/m(2) increase in BMI and an approximately 9.6 kg gain in body weight between TT and AA/CC homozygotes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The association between FTO genotypes and BMI was stronger in the cohorts with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCOS</z:e> than in the general female populations from large genome-wide association studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Deviation from an additive genetic model was observed in heavier populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The effect of FTO SNPs on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-related traits in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCOS</z:e> seems to be more than two times greater than the effect found in large population-based studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This suggests an interaction between FTO and the metabolic context or polygenic background of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCOS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
