<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A systematic computer-assisted and hand search was conducted to identify relevant articles with longitudinal design and quantitative measurement of alcohol consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adjustment was made for the sick-quitter effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used fractional polynomials in a meta-regression to determine the dose-response relationships by sex and end point using lifetime abstainers as the reference group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The search revealed 20 cohort studies that met our inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A U-shaped relationship was found for both sexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with lifetime abstainers, the relative risk (RR) for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among men was most protective when consuming 22 g/day alcohol (RR 0.87 [95% CI 0.76-1.00]) and became deleterious at just over 60 g/day alcohol (1.01 [0.71-1.44]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among women, consumption of 24 g/day alcohol was most protective (0.60 [0.52-0.69]) and became deleterious at about 50 g/day alcohol (1.02 [0.83-1.26]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis confirms previous research findings that moderate alcohol consumption is protective for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in men and women </plain></SENT>
