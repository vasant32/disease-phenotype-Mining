<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The observation that patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> tend to have larger glomeruli than patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was first made more than 10 years ago </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has also been noted that type 2 diabetic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> often have more <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> renal function and structure than type 1 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, whether these observations are linked or have any bearing on the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in the two types of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> remains uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we put forward several hypotheses as to why glomerular volume in type 1 differs from that in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We suggest that although type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients appear to progress through similar stages of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, the route they take may differ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Differences in the way in which the glomeruli respond to the diabetic milieu may enable some type 2 diabetic patients to preserve their filtration surface in the face of an expanding mesangium </plain></SENT>
