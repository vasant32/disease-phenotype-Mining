<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to study whether young first-degree relatives of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (FDRs) have altered insulin secretion and insulin clearance in response to gastric inhibitory <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (GIP) in combination with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and arginine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A hyperglycemic clamp (11.1 mmol/l for 115 min), followed by addition of GIP (2 pmol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>kg(-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>min(-1), 60-115 min) and an arginine bolus and infusion (10 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>kg(-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>min(-1), 90-115 min), was conducted on 14 healthy volunteers and 13 FDRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both groups had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FDRs were more insulin resistant (HOMA(IR)) under basal conditions (P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FDRs demonstrated significant global impairment in insulin secretion capacity, which was not specific for one of the secretagogues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Insulin clearance was significantly reduced in the group of FDRs under basal conditions and in response to GIP, but there was no general defect in insulin clearance in response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and arginine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The HOMA(IR) correlated negatively (P &lt; 0.01) with insulin clearance under basal conditions (r = -0.96) and under GIP infusion (r = -0.56) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We propose that impairment in insulin secretion capacity and decreased insulin sensitivity is compensated for several mechanisms, one of which includes a GIP-dependent reduction of the insulin clearance that will increase peripheral insulin levels to maintain normoglycemia </plain></SENT>
