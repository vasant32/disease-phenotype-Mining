<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Muscle biopsies were taken from m. vastus lateralis at each insulin level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that non-oxidative <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism could be stimulated by insulin in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three groups (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The values obtained at the highest insulin levels (around 140 microU/ml) were lower in both <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> groups compared to the lean control subjects (118 +/- 21, 185 +/- 31, 249 +/- 14 mg.(m2)-1.min-1 (p less than 0.01] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Insulin stimulation of the <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase activity at a <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-6-phosphate concentration of 0.1 mmol/l was absent in both <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> groups, while activities increased significantly in the lean control subjects (19.6 +/- 4.2% to 45.6 +/- 6.8%, p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">Glycogen</z:chebi> synthase activities at the highest insulin concentrations only differed significantly between lean control subjects and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> diabetic patients (45 +/- 7% and 31 +/- 5%, p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in peripheral tissues in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects with and without Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may be partly explained by a reduced insulin mediated non-oxidative <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism and that this abnormality might be due to an absent insulin stimulation of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase in skeletal muscles </plain></SENT>
