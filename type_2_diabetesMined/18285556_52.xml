<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the mechanism of activation of AMPK by BBR and explored whether derivatization of BBR could improve its in vivo efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: AMPK phosphorylation was examined in L6 myotubes and LKB1(-/-) cells, with or without the Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase (CAMKK) inhibitor STO-609 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Oxygen consumption was measured in L6 myotubes and isolated muscle mitochondria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect of a BBR derivative, dihydroberberine (dhBBR), on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism was examined in rodents fed a high-fat diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS; We have made the following novel observations: 1) BBR dose-dependently inhibited respiration in L6 myotubes and muscle mitochondria, through a specific effect on respiratory complex I, similar to that observed with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>; 2) activation of AMPK by BBR did not rely on the activity of either LKB1 or CAMKKbeta, consistent with major regulation at the level of the AMPK phosphatase; and 3) a novel BBR derivative, dhBBR, was identified that displayed improved in vivo efficacy in terms of counteracting <z:mp ids='MP_0010024'>increased adiposity</z:mp>, tissue <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> accumulation, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in high-fat-fed rodents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This effect is likely due to enhanced oral bioavailability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Complex I of the respiratory chain represents a major target for compounds that improve whole-body insulin sensitivity through increased AMPK activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The identification of a novel derivative of BBR with improved in vivo efficacy highlights the potential importance of BBR as a novel therapy for the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
