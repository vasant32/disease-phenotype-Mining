<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 3,156 African American, Non-Hispanic white, Hispanic, and Chinese-American men aged 45-84 years who participated in the baseline visit of the Multi-Ethnic Study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (MESA) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Odd sratios and 95% CIs for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and IFG compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> for quartiles of hormones were estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After adjusting for age, ethnicity, BMI, and waist circumference, IFG and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were associated inversely with total <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="25" ids="50112">sex hormone</z:chebi>-binding globulin (SHBG) and positively with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> (E2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dehydroepiandrosterone was positively associated with IFG but not with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Associations did not differ across ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, total <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> and SHBG were associated inversely and E2 was associated positively with IFG and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further research is warranted to better understand the underlying biological mechanisms </plain></SENT>
