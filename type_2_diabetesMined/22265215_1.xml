<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Patients with T2DM often view self-monitoring of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (SMBG) as burdensome and pointless, which may affect their broader attitudes toward <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined how a structured SMBG protocol influenced <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-efficacy and autonomous motivation over time, and linked these to changes in glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Structured Testing Program (STeP) is a 12-month, two-arm, cluster-randomized trial that assessed the efficacy of structured SMBG in 483 insulin-na√Øve T2DM patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Measures included: Confidence in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Self-Care for Type 2 patients (CIDS-T2), <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp>-related Autonomous Motivation (DRAM), self-management behaviors and HbA1c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Intent-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analyses showed significant increases in CIDS-T2 scores over time (main effects p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PP analysis showed significant between-group differences (p&lt;0.05), with adherent STG patients displaying greater CIDS-T2 improvement than ACG patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PP analyses showed main and between-group effects in DRAM with similar findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Changes in CIDS-T2 were related to HbA1c changes over time; no self-management variable mediated this relationship </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CIDS-T2 and HbA1c displayed a significant time-concordant relationship </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Structured SMBG leads to significant increases in self-confidence and autonomous motivation associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Changes in self-confidence are linked to changes in glycemic control and share a time-concordant relationship </plain></SENT>
