<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The participants were followed for incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> through 2010 (median follow-up, 9 years).RESULTSWomen with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> had elevated fetuin-A levels compared with women with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (P = 0.019), but fetuin-A levels were not elevated in women with impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fetuin-A did not vary by <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance status in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were significant interactions of fetuin-A by sex for prevalent (P = 0.007) and incident (P = 0.020) <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For women, each SD (0.10 g/L) higher fetuin-A level was associated with a higher odds of prevalent <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (odds ratio [OR] 1.79, 95% CI 1.47-2.17) and greater risk of incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (hazard ratio [HR] 1.66, 95% CI 1.18-2.34), adjusting for age and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These associations were not materially altered by adjustment for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk factors but were attenuated by adjusting for postchallenge <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among men, although positive associations with prevalent (OR 1.15, [0.94-1.41]) and incident (HR 1.24, [0.93-1.65]) <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were suggested in age-adjusted models, risk estimates attenuated to one after multivariable adjustment.CONCLUSIONSHigher fetuin-A concentrations were independently associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in older women but were not related to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk in older men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fetuin-A may provide novel insights into mechanisms underlying sex differences in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk in old age </plain></SENT>
