<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the PPARGC1A gene have been conflictingly reported to be associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2D) in several populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study aimed to evaluate the association of PPARGC1A genetic polymorphisms with T2D in Han Chinese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: SNPs in the PPARGC1A gene were validated and six valid SNPs, including rs13131226, rs7656250, rs2970856, rs8192678, rs3736265 and rs3774923 were genotyped in 1090 subjects (595 patients and 495 controls) with a protocol of PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Single marker association analysis was conducted and there was no significant association between the PPARGC1A polymorphisms and T2D in Han Chinese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Haplotype analysis with multiple loci, however, indicated that a common haplotype C-T-T-G-C-G was significantly associated with the increased risk of T2D (P=0.001, OR=1.80, 95%CI 1.24-2.63) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant association between genotypes or haplotypes of PPARGC1A and T2D related phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present study provides evidence that a common haplotype of PPARGC1A genetic polymorphisms are moderately associated with T2D in Han Chinese population </plain></SENT>
