<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study population included participants free of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> at baseline (n = 1,826) who participated in a follow-up examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Generalized estimating equations were used to examine the association of steps per day with incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During 5 years of follow-up, 243 incident cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When compared with participants in the lowest quartile of steps per day (&lt;3,500 steps), participants in the upper three quartiles of steps per day had lower odds for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, consistent with a threshold effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Contrasting the three upper quartiles with the lowest quartile, the odds ratio of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 0.71 (95% CI 0.51-0.98) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Modest levels of physical activity are associated with a lower risk of incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, compared with lower levels of activity </plain></SENT>
