<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three hundred and sixty-five offspring of people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> underwent measurement of energy expenditure (PAEE measured using the flex heart rate method), total body movement (daily activity counts from accelerometry data), [VO2max] predicted from a submaximal graded treadmill exercise test and anthropometric and metabolic status at baseline and 1 year (n = 321) in the ProActive trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clustered metabolic risk was calculated by summing standardised values for waist circumference, fasting triacylglycerol, insulin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, blood pressure and the inverse of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Linear regression was used to quantify the association between changes in PAEE, total body movement and fitness and clustered metabolic risk at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Participants increased their activity by 0.01 units PAEE kJ kg(-1) day(-1) over 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Total body movement increased by an average of 9,848 counts per day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Change in total body movement (beta = -0.066, p = 0.004) and fitness (beta = -0.056, p = 0.003) was associated with clustered metabolic risk at follow-up, independently of age, sex, smoking status, socioeconomic status and baseline metabolic score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Small increases in activity and fitness were associated with a reduction in clustered metabolic risk in this cohort of carefully characterised at-risk individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further research to quantify the reduction in risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> associated with feasible changes in these variables should inform preventive interventions </plain></SENT>
