<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relation between insulin sensitivity and secretion is curvilinear and mathematically best described as a hyperbolic relation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several potential mediators have been suggested to be signals for the beta cells to respond to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> such as <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, free fatty acids, autonomic nerves, fat-derived hormones and the gut hormone glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Failure of these signals or of the pancreatic beta cells to adequately adapt insulin secretion in relation to insulin sensitivity results in inappropriate insulin levels, impaired <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, treatment of IGT and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> should aim at restoring the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> relation between insulin sensitivity and secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Such treatment includes stimulation of insulin secretion (sulphonylureas, repaglinide and nateglinide) and insulin sensitivity (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi>), as well as treatment aimed at supporting the signals mediating the islet adaptation (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="38324">cholinergic agonists</z:chebi> and GLP-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both, for correct understanding of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> pathophysiology and for development of novel treatment modalities, therefore, the non-linear inverse relation between insulin sensitivity and secretion needs to be acknowledged </plain></SENT>
