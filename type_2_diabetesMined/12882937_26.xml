<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To find genes for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> it is necessary to assess insulin action in large populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have previously measured insulin action in a large cohort of subjects (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin Resistance</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Study [IRAS] Family Study) using the minimal model approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we compare sensitivity from the minimal model (insulin sensitivity index [S(I)]) with the measure of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> emanating from the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The former measure emerges from the glycemic response to endogenous and exogenous insulin; the latter is based solely on fasting measures of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 112 pedigrees were represented, including 1,362 individuals with full phenotypic assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Heritability of S(I) was significantly greater than that for HOMA (0.310 vs. 0.163) and for fasting insulin (0.171), adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, and BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, correlation between S(I) and either HOMA or fasting insulin was only approximately 50% accounted for by genetic factors, with the remainder accounted for by environment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus S(I), a direct measure of insulin sensitivity, is determined more by genetic factors rather than measures such as HOMA, which reflect fasting insulin </plain></SENT>
