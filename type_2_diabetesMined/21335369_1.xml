<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: An association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> has often been found in cross-sectional studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to reassess this relationship in a prospective Taiwanese cohort of type 2 diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We enrolled 738 normoalbuminuric type 2 diabetic subjects, aged 56.6 ± 9.0 years, between 2003 and 2005 and followed them through the end of 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Average follow-up time was 5.2 ± 0.8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used urine albumin-to-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio to define <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> and the homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-IR) to assess <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence rate ratio and Cox proportional hazards model were used to evaluate the association between HOMA-IR and development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found incidences of <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> of 64.8, 83.5, 93.3, and 99.0 per 1,000 person-years for the lowest to highest quartiles of HOMA-IR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with those in the lowest quartile of HOMA-IR, the incidence rate ratios for those in the 2nd, 3rd, and highest quartiles were 1.28 (95% CI 0.88-1.87), 1.44 (0.99-2.08), and 1.52 (1.06-2.20), respectively (trend test: P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By comparison with those in the lowest quartile, the adjusted hazard ratios were 1.37 (0.93-2.02), 1.66 (1.12-2.47), and 1.76 (1.20-2.59) for those in the 2nd, 3rd, and highest HOMA-IR quartiles, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: According to the dose-response effects of HOMA-IR shown in this prospective study, we conclude that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> could significantly predict development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
