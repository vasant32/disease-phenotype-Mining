<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This longitudinal study (9 and 18 month follow-up) of 338 DPN patients (mean age 61 years; 71% male; 73% type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) examined the temporal relationships between DPN severity (mean +/- SD; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> disability score [NDS], 7.4 +/- 2.2; mean vibration perception threshold, 41.5 +/- 9.5 V), DPN somatic experiences (symptoms and foot ulceration), DPN psychosocial consequences (restrictions in activities of daily living [ADL] and social self-perception) and the Hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> subscale measuring depressive symptoms (HADS-D; mean 4.9 +/- 3.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Controlling for baseline HADS-D and demographic/disease variables, NDS at baseline significantly predicted increased HADS-D over 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This association was mediated by baseline unsteadiness, which was significantly associated with increased HADS-D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Baseline ADL restrictions significantly predicted increased HADS-D and partly mediated the association between baseline unsteadiness and change in HADS-D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increased pain, unsteadiness and ADL restrictions from baseline to 9 months each significantly predicted increased HADS-D over 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Change in social self-perception from baseline to 9 months significantly predicted increased HADS-D and partly mediated the relationships of change in unsteadiness and ADL restrictions with change in HADS-D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These results confirm that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> is a risk factor for depressive symptoms because it generates pain and unsteadiness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Unsteadiness is the symptom with the strongest association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and is linked to depressive symptoms by perceptions of diminished self-worth as a result of inability to perform social roles </plain></SENT>
