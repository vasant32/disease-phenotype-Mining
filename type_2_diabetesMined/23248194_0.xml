<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We calculated the incidence rate of fracture-related hospitalization by age and used Cox proportional hazards models to investigate the association of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with risk of fracture after adjustment for demographic, lifestyle, and behavioral risk factors.RESULTSThere were 1,078 incident fracture-related hospitalizations among 15,140 participants during a median of 20 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The overall incidence rate was 4.0 per 1,000 person-years (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.8-4.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was significantly and independently associated with an increased risk of fracture (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.74; 95% CI, 1.42-2.14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There also was a significantly increased risk of fracture among persons with diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were treated with insulin (HR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.15-3.05) and among persons with diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with HbA(1c) â‰¥8% (1.63; 1.09-2.44) compared with those with HbA(1c) &lt;8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Undiagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was not significantly associated with risk of fracture (HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.82-1.53).CONCLUSIONSThis study supports recommendations from the American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association for assessment of fracture risk and implementation of prevention strategies in persons with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, particularly those persons with poor <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control </plain></SENT>
