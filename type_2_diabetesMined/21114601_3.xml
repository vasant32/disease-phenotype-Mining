<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Both in vitro and in vivo tests were conducted using NIT-1 and HEK293 cell lines, male <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and db/db mice and isolated perfused rat pancreas preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: AS1535907 had an EC₅₀ value of 1.5 µM for human GPR119 transfected in HEK293 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AS1535907 enhanced insulin secretion in NIT-1 cells and in the perfused rat pancreas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A transient increase in the human insulin promoter activity was also observed in NIT-1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>First-phase insulin secretion was particularly more evident in the AS1535907-treated perfused rat pancreas than that in the nateglinide or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi>-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance improved following a single dose of AS1535907 in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and db/db mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, 2 weeks of multiple dosing significantly increased plasma insulin levels and decreased blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels in db/db mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After 3 weeks of treatment in db/db mice, the numbers of insulin and proliferation cell nuclear antigen-positive cells and the islet area were significantly higher than those in the vehicle-treated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As compared with the vehicle, gene expression analysis revealed that AS1535907 significantly upregulated transcription factors (Nkx 2.2, Nkx 6.1, NeuroD and activin A), responsible for β-cell regulation and prohormone-converting enzyme 1 responsible for insulin biosynthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that AS1535907 can potentially regulate first-phase insulin secretion and exert a protective effect on pancreatic β-cell function via regulation of transcription factors </plain></SENT>
