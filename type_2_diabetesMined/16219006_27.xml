<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Excessive intake of fat results in deposition of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> not only in fat tissue but also in skeletal muscle and liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, both plasma and intracellular concentrations of free fatty acids and their metabolites rise and activate signal transduction pathways, which will induce <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and impair insulin signalling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, elevated circulating <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> impair endothelial function and fibrinolysis, which contributes to the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, therapeutic strategies aiming at reduction of (intracellular) <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> availability in skeletal muscle and liver and pharmacological modulation of the signalling pathways activated by increased <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> stores represent promising targets for future treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and prevention of its complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This review focuses on the effects of increased <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> availability on the regulation of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in skeletal muscle and liver as well as on vascular function </plain></SENT>
