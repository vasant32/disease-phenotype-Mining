<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and an HbA(1c) of 6.5-9.0% while on a stable dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (â‰¥ 1500 mg/day) combined with diet and exercise for at least 12 weeks were randomized in a double-blind manner to receive either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> 100 mg daily (N = 516) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> (starting dose 1 mg/day and up-titrated, based upon patient's self-monitoring of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> results, to a maximum dose of up to 6 mg/day) (N = 519) for 30 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary analysis assessed whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> is non-inferior to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> in reducing HbA(1c) at week 30 (based on the criterion of having an upper bound of the 95% CI less than the prespecified non-inferiority bound of 0.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: the mean baseline HbA(1c) was 7.5% in both the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> group (n = 443) and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> group (n = 436) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 30 weeks, the least squares (LS) mean change in HbA(1c) from baseline was -0.47% with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> and -0.54% with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi>, with a between-group difference (95% CI) of 0.07% (-0.03, 0.16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This result met the prespecified criterion for declaring non-inferiority </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The percentages of patients with an HbA(1c) &lt; 7.0% at week 30 were 52 and 60% in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The LS mean change in fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> from baseline (95% CI) was -0.8 mmol/l (-1.0, -0.6) with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> and -1.0 mmol/l (-1.2, -0.8) with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi>, for a between-group difference (95% CI) of 0.2 mmol/l (-0.1, 0.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The percentages of patients for whom <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> was reported were 7% in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> group and 22% in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> group (percentage-point difference = -15, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Relative to baseline, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> was associated with a mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> (-0.8 kg), whereas <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> was associated with a mean <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> (1.2 kg), yielding a between-group difference of -2.0 kg (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and inadequate glycaemic control on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy, the addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> led to similar improvement in glycaemic control after 30 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">Sitagliptin</z:chebi> was generally well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Compared to treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi>, treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> was associated with a lower risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> and with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> versus <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00701090) </plain></SENT>
