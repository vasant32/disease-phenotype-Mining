<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies suggest that SNP17 (rs2297508, exon18c and G952G) of SREBP-1c gene and a common SREBP-1c SNP6 (rs11868035) are associated with an increased risk of T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study aimed to confirm the previously reported association in a Chinese population and to examine the two SREBP-1c SNPs for their associations with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and blood <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We genotyped two SREBP-1c SNPs in a case-control study (n=327) from Chinese, including 156 patients with T2DM and 171 healthy controls, using polymerase chain reaction-denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (PCR-DHPLC) and tested for association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and blood <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genotype and allele distributions and haplotype construction were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The genotype and allele distributions of rs2297508 and rs11868035 polymorphisms were significantly different in type 2 diabetic patients compared to controls (P=0.002 and P=0.013; 0.00 and 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Haplotype analyses showed significant association with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk and confirmed the results of the single SNP analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The plasma levels of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-c of the minor allele-C carriers of the two SNPs were both significantly higher than the noncarriers in the control group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> index (HOMA-IRI) of the rare homozygotes C/C of rs11868035 was significantly lower than that of T/T in the T2DM group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the SREBP-1c SNPs rs2297508 and rs11868035 are associated with a significantly increased risk of T2DM and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> in the Chinese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the SNP (rs11868035) is closely related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (IR) in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
