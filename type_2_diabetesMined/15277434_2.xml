<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study population included 85 Finnish type 2 diabetic and 126 nondiabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The genetic analyses were performed using the PCR, single-strand conformation polymorphism, restriction fragment-length polymorphism, and automated laser fluorescence scanning analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A detailed neurologic examination and neurophysiologic analyses were performed at the time of diagnosis and at the 10-year examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The genetic screening identified four polymorphisms: C-106T, C-11G, A11370G, and C19739A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The C and Z-2 alleles of the C-106T polymorphism and the previously reported (CA)(n) repeat marker were more frequent in type 2 diabetic subjects than in nondiabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At baseline, the diabetic subjects with the T allele of the C-106T polymorphism had lower sensory response amplitude values in the peroneal (P = 0.025), sural (P = 0.007), and radial (P = 0.057) nerves and, during follow-up, a greater decrease in the conduction velocity of the motor peroneal nerve than those with the C-106C genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No associations were found between the polymorphisms examined and clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001271'>polyneuropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The C-106T polymorphism of the ALR gene may contribute to an early development of neurophysiologic deterioration in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
