<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Associations between PPARG polymorphisms with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> parameters and with the 6-year incidence of impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were tested in 3,914 French Caucasians from the DESIR (Data From an Epidemiological Study on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin Resistance</z:hpo> Syndrome) cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In subjects normoglycemic at baseline (n = 3,498), the 6-year risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> was lower in PPARG Ala carriers (odds ratio [OR] vs. ProPro = 0.66 [95% CI 0.44-0.99], P = 0.046 adjusted for sex, age, and BMI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Similar results were found with the PPARG C1431T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; adjusted OR = 0.65 [0.44-0.96], P = 0.036) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both alleles are in strong linkage disequilibrium (D' = 0.669, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The baseline mean fasting insulin and homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-IR) were lower in Ala carriers compared with ProPro homozygotes (P = 0.001 for both), with smaller increases in mean insulin and HOMA-IR during follow-up (P = 0.007 and 0.018, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No association with insulin levels or HOMA-IR was found with C1431T </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this cohort, the APM1 G-11391A SNP is associated with the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The combined effects of PPARG Pro12Ala and APM1 G-11391A SNPs showed no interaction on the risk of 6-year <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The PPARG Ala allele showed a relatively high protective effect in developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> during a 6-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cumulative rather than synergistic effects of PPARG Pro12Ala and APM1 SNPs on <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk are suggested </plain></SENT>
