<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To identify genetic variants contributing to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e>) in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we performed a genome-wide analysis of 115,352 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in pools of 105 unrelated case subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e> and 102 unrelated control subjects who have had type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for &gt; or =10 years without macroalbuminuria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using a sliding window statistic of ranked SNPs, we identified a 200-kb region on 8q24 harboring three SNPs showing substantial differences in allelic frequency between case and control pools </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These SNPs were genotyped in individuals comprising each pool, and strong evidence for association was found with rs2720709 (P = 0.000021; odds ratio 2.57 [95% CI 1.66-3.96]), which is located in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytoma</z:hpo> variant translocation gene PVT1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We sequenced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> exons, exon-intron boundaries, and the promoter of PVT1 and identified 47 variants, 11 of which represented nonredundant markers with minor allele frequency &gt; or =0.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We subsequently genotyped these 11 variants and an additional 87 SNPs identified through public databases in 319-kb flanking rs2720709 ( approximately 1 SNP/3.5 kb); 23 markers were associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e> at P &lt; 0.01 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The strongest evidence for association was found for rs2648875 (P = 0.0000018; 2.97 [1.90-4.65]), which maps to intron 8 of PVT1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Together, these results suggest that PVT1 may contribute to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e> susceptibility in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
