<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently Iwata et al. reported that the polymorphism in NeuroD exon 2(Ala45Thr) was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult-onset</z:hpo> Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Japanese </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the mutations in the NeuroD as a regulator of insulin transcription have been reported to result in Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We, therefore, aimed to clarify the role of this Ala45Thr polymorphism in the susceptibility to Type 1a, immune-mediated, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> of child-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> Japanese patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eighty patients with child-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were examined along with 121 non-diabetic subjects as the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The polymorphism in Ala45Thr was defined using the PCR-RFLP method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The GAD Ab, IA-2 Ab, HLA-DRB1 genotypes and residual beta-cell function at 3 years from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> were evaluated in relation to the difference in this polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the Ala45Thr heterozygotes was significantly higher in the Type 1 diabetic patients than in the controls (21.3 versus 9.9%, P=0.0252) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequency of loss of beta-cell function was higher in heterozygotes patients than in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> homozygotes patients (P=0.0112) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Type 1 diabetic patients with DRB1*0901 allele showed a significantly higher frequency, 27.9%, of the Ala45Thr variant than the controls (P=0.0041) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the Ala45Thr polymorphism contributes to the risk of development of, and to the early deterioration of beta-cell function, in Type 1a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among the Japanese population </plain></SENT>
