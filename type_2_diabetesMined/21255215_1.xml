<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> versus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> on the circulating numbers of EMPs and EPCs in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind, comparator-controlled, 24-week single-centre trial conducted in a Teaching Hospital in Naples, Italy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hundred and ten people with newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were never treated with antihyperglycaemic drugs and had <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA1c) levels between 7 and 10% were given <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> (15-45 mg/day) (n = 55) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (1000-2000 mg/day) (n = 55) as an active comparator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Absolute change from baseline to final visit in circulating EMPs and EPCs and their ratio were the main outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Baseline characteristics did not differ between the study groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The decrease in circulating EMPs CD31+ [intergroup difference, -32 counts/Âµl (95% CI -51 to -9)] and the increase in EPCs CD34+/KDR+ [intergroup difference, 33 cells/10(6) events (95% CI 13 to 55)] were greater with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> versus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>EMPs/EPCs ratio was reduced with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> and unchanged with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> [difference, -1.5 (95% CI -2.6 to -0.5), p &lt; 0.001] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Participants assigned to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> gained more weight and experienced greater improvements in some coronary risk measures [<z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>)-cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, adiponectin and C-reactive protein (CRP)] than did those assigned to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> treatment improved the imbalance between endothelial damage and repair capacity and led to more favourable changes in coronary risk factors in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
