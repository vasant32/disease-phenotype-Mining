<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Herein, the results of clinical trials assessing the efficacy, safety and tolerability of liraglutide when used in combination with either one or two oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> therapies are summarised, then contrasted with the effects of exenatide and dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP-4) inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>GLP-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> lead to effective glycaemic control when used as combination therapy with either one or two oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> agents, and may confer overall benefits in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and blood pressure in some subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These agents are well tolerated; the most commonly reported adverse effect is mild-to-moderate gastrointestinal symptoms, which are usually transient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> in these trials were low, although higher rates were noted when combined with a sulphonylurea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While further study will be required, GLP-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> may offer important advantages over other diabetic therapies, including DPP-4 inhibitors </plain></SENT>
