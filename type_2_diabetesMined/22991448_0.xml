<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Eighty-one individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were matched for HbA(1c) and divided by age into three subgroups of 27 individuals (1: ≥70 years; 2: 60-69 years; and 3: ≤59 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> underwent ambulatory continuous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring for quantifying the dawn phenomenon (i.e., the absolute [∂G, mg/dL] or relative [∂G%] increments from nocturnal nadirs to prebreakfast time points) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HbA(1c) levels and 24-h glycemic profiles were similar across the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> increments (mean ± <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) were identical in the three groups: ∂G (mg/dL), 22.0 ± 4.7 (1), 21.3 ± 3.6 (2), and 18.0 ± 3.6 (3) and δG (%), 19.9 ± 4.9 (1), 21.6 ± 4.4 (2), and 17.6 ± 4.2 (3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using the most common definition (∂G &gt;10 mg/dL), the prevalence of the dawn phenomenon was 52, 70, and 59% in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The dawn phenomenon is present in the elderly </plain></SENT>
