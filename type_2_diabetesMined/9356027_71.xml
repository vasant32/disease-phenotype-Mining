<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="74" ids="28073">chromium</z:chebi> requirement is postulated to increase with increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that the elevated intake of supplemental <z:chebi fb="74" ids="28073">chromium</z:chebi> is involved in the control of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Individuals being treated for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (180 men and women) were divided randomly into three groups and supplemented with: 1) placebo, 2) 1.92 micromol (100 microg) Cr as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50369">chromium picolinate</z:chebi> two times per day, or 3) 9.6 micromol (500 microg) Cr two times per day </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HbA1c values improved significantly after 2 months in the group receiving 19.2 pmol (1,000 microg) Cr per day and was lower in both <z:chebi fb="74" ids="28073">chromium</z:chebi> groups after 4 months (placebo, 8.5 +/- 0.2%; 3.85 micromol Cr, 7.5 +/- 0.2%; 19.2 micromol Cr, 6.6 +/- 0.1%) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two-hour <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> values were also significantly lower for the subjects consuming 19.2 micromol supplemental Cr after both 2 and 4 months (4-month values: placebo, 12.3 +/- 0.4 mmo/l; 19.2 micromol Cr, 10.5 +/- 0.2 mmol/l) </plain></SENT>
