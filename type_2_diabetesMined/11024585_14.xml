<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The reported incidence rates ranged from 1.0 to 4.0% per year for people with varying degrees of baseline plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels not reaching the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> according to the criteria of the World Health Organization </plain></SENT>
