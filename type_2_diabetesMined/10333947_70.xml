<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of a thiazolidinedione (600 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi>) insulin-sensitizing treatment on total body fat measured by underwater weighing, on intra- and extra-abdominal fat mass using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and on anthropometric measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Type 2 diabetic outpatients were studied in a double-blind randomized trial carried out at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, Scotland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Groups who received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> (8 men, 3 women) and placebo (8 men, 2 women) were well matched for age, BMI, total body fat percentage by underwater weighing, and intra-abdominal fat (kilograms) by MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 12 weeks, body weight changes in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> group (mean +0.66 kg [95% CI -0.71 to 2.04], P = 0.31) and the placebo group (mean +0.25 kg [-0.64 to 1.13], P = 0.55) were not statistically different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Changes in total body fat with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> (mean +1.02% body wt [-1.13 to 3.17], P = 0.32) and placebo (mean -0.54% body wt [-1.68 to 0.59], P = 0.31) were not significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was, however, a decrease in intra-abdominal fat mass in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi>-treated group (mean -0.47 kg [-0.79 to -0.13], P = 0.01), and this was significantly different (P = 0.03) from placebo treatment (mean -0.41 kg [-0.77 to -0.05]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with the thiazolidinedione <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> in human patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> decreases intra-abdominal fat mass but does not affect total body fat or weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This potentially valuable effect points to a differential action on insulin sensitivity in different adipose tissue depots </plain></SENT>
