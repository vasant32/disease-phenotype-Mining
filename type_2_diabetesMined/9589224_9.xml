<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002917'>Hypomagnesemia</z:hpo> occurs in 25-38% of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several studies have suggested an association between <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> (Mg) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and/or reduction of insulin secretion in these cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to evaluate if Mg supplementation (as <z:chebi fb="4" ids="31794">magnesium oxide</z:chebi> [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31794">MgO</z:chebi>]) would improve metabolic control in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 128 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (32 men, 96 women, aged 30-69 years), treated by diet or diet plus oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs, in the Bahia Federal University Hospital, Brazil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients at risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002917'>hypomagnesemia</z:hpo> or with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>reduced renal function</z:hpo> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study was a clinical randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients received either placebo, 20.7 mmol <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31794">MgO</z:chebi>, or 41.4 mmol <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31794">MgO</z:chebi> daily (elementary Mg) for 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mg concentrations were measured in plasma, in mononuclear cells, and in 24-h urine samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, HbA1, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24103">fructosamine</z:chebi> were used as parameters of metabolic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the patients, 47.7% had low plasma Mg, and 31.1% had low intramononuclear Mg levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Intracellular Mg in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was significantly lower than in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> population (62 blood donors; 1.4 +/- 0.6 vs. 1.7 +/- 0.6 micrograms/mg of total proteins) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between plasma and intracellular Mg concentrations (r = -0.179; P = 0.15) or between Mg concentrations and glycemic control (r = -0.165; P = 0.12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Intracellular Mg levels were lower in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> than in those without (1.2 +/- 0.5 vs. 1.5 +/- 0.6 micrograms/mg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Similar findings were observed in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary disease</z:hpo> (1.0 +/- 0.5 vs. 1.5 +/- 0.6 micrograms/mg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In the placebo and in the 20.7 mmol Mg groups, neither a change in plasma and intracellular levels nor an improvement in glycemic control were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Replacement with 41.4 mmol Mg tended to increase plasma, cellular, and urine Mg and caused a significant fall (4.1 +/- 0.8 to 3.8 +/- 0.7 mmol/l) in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24103">fructosamine</z:chebi> (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, 1.87-2.87 mmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Mg <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> is common in poorly controlled patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, especially in those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>More prolonged use of Mg in doses that are higher than usual is needed to establish its routine or selective administration in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> to improve control or prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> complications </plain></SENT>
