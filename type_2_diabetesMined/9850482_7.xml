<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intensive therapy was shown by the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) to avert complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Economic analyses and models have been used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of intensive therapy for people with type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An economic analysis of the DCCT estimated the cost of intensive therapy to be two to three times greater than that of conventional therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, an economic model predicts that intensive therapy, as compared with conventional therapy, could reduce <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo> from 34 to 20% or by 41%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal disease</z:hpo> from 24 to 7% or by 71%, and lower-extremity <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputations</z:mpath> from 7 to 4% or by 43% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although intensive therapy is more expensive, when the costs of complications are factored in, it becomes cost-effective for treatment of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, a model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of intensive therapy for people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> found that the lifetime costs of general and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related medical care would be approximately two times greater </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the reduction in lifetime costs of complications, which would produce substantial reductions in costs of treatment, largely offsets the difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intensive therapy for type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may be more expensive than conventional therapy, but from an economic perspective, it is comparable in cost to pharmacological therapies for people with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>From a health system viewpoint, intensive therapy represents a fruitful long-term financial investment </plain></SENT>
