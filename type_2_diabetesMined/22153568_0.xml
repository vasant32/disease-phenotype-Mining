<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was assessed at baseline and at 24 weeks by the validated EQ-5D questionnaire (visual analogue score [VAS] and five dimensions) in 66,726 people who had started using basal insulin detemir, mealtime insulin aspart (with or without a basal insulin) or biphasic insulin aspart 30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For the overall cohort, reported HRQoL increased significantly by 13.8 points from 63.4 points at baseline to 77.2 points at 24 weeks (p&lt;0.001) (scale 1-100, 100=best health imaginable) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Beginning or changing insulin was associated with a significant increase in HRQoL score (+15.0 points and +11.1 points, respectively), resulting in a similar score at 24 weeks in the two populations (77.8 and 75.9 points) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reported HRQoL also increased statistically significantly in people administering any insulin analogue regimen and across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> regions, although there were some marked regional differences in reported HRQoL at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Compared with baseline scores, beginning insulin with, or switching to, insulin analogue therapies are associated with increased HRQoL </plain></SENT>
