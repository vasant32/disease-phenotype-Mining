<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We studied the 15-year cardiovascular mortality and morbidity of newly diagnosed patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and of nondiabetic control subjects and the predictors of cardiovascular mortality in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed a 15-year prospective study of 133 middle-aged patients with newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 144 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> were assessed in both groups at baseline and after 5 and 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Total mortality was markedly higher in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (total: 44.3 vs. 12.9% for men, age-adjusted odds ratio [OR] 5.0, P &lt; 0.001; 44.4 vs. 11.0% for women, OR 5.2, P &lt; 0.001), which was due to increased cardiovascular mortality (ORs for men and women: 6.2 and 11.2, respectively, P &lt; 0.001 for both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidences of fatal and nonfatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were likewise higher in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In univariate analyses and various multiple logistic regression analyses, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> was a constant predictor of cardiovascular mortality assessed at the time of diagnosis or at 5- or 10-year examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> abnormalities characteristic of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0003233'>low HDL cholesterol</z:hpo>, high <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B levels, and low <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B ratio as a marker for <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> size) were predictive of cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in these analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This long-term study of a well-characterized group of newly diagnosed patients strengthens the view that the prognosis in middle-aged subjects is markedly impaired and that both <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> and compositional <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> abnormalities are predictors of cardiovascular mortality in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
