<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A recent "treat-to-target" study has shown that more patients on insulin glargine reached HbA(1c) levels &lt; or =7.0% without confirmed nocturnal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We further assessed the risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> in a meta-analysis of controlled trials of a similar design for insulin glargine versus once- or twice-daily <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin in adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> studies were 24-28 weeks long, except one 52-week study, for which interim 20-week data were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patient demographics were similar between the insulin glargine (n = 1,142) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin (n = 1,162) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The proportion of patients achieving target HbA(1c) (&lt; or =7.0%) was similar between insulin glargine-and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin-treated patients (30.8 and 32.1%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a consistent significant reduction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> risk associated with insulin glargine, compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin, in terms of overall symptomatic (11%; P = 0.0006) and nocturnal (26%; P &lt; 0.0001) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most notably, the risk of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> and severe nocturnal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> were reduced with insulin glargine by 46% (P = 0.0442) and 59% (P = 0.0231), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results confirmed that insulin glargine given once daily reduces the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin, which can facilitate more aggressive insulin treatment to a HbA(1c) target of &lt; or =7.0% in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
