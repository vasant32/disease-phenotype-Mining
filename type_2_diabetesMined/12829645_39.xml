<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dominant-negative muscle-specific IGF-I receptor (MKR) mice exhibit elevated <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels at an early age and eventually develop type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the role of elevated <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> in the progression of the diabetic state, MKR mice were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32509">WY14,643</z:chebi>, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-alpha <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="32509">WY14,643</z:chebi> treatment markedly reduced serum fatty acid and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels within a few days, as well as muscle <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels, and subsequently normalized <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin levels in MKR mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp analysis showed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32509">WY14,643</z:chebi> treatment enhanced muscle and adipose tissue <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake by improving whole-body insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Insulin suppression of endogenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production by the liver of MKR mice was also improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation was increased in liver and skeletal muscle, whereas gene expression levels of hepatic gluconeogenic enzymes were decreased in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32509">WY14,643</z:chebi>-treated MKR mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="32509">WY14,643</z:chebi> treatment also improved the pattern of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion from the perfused pancreata of MKR mice and reduced the beta-cell mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these findings suggest that the reduction in circulating or intracellular <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> by activation of PPAR-alpha improved insulin sensitivity and the diabetic condition of MKR mice </plain></SENT>
