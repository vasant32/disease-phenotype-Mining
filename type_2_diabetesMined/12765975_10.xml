<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several genome-wide linkage scans have been carried out to identify quantitative trait loci for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and related metabolic phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, no previous linkage scans have focused on the response to exercise training of relevant metabolic traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a genome-wide linkage scan for baseline fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> and their responses to a 20-week exercise training program in nondiabetic white and black men and women from the HERITAGE Family Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In SIBPAL linkage analyses, the maximum number of sibpairs available was 344 and 93 for baseline phenotypes and 300 and 72 for exercise training response phenotypes in whites and blacks, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 509 markers with an average spacing of 6.0 Mb were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The strongest linkage was found for the changes in fasting insulin in response to exercise training with a marker in the leptin gene on 7q31 (empirical multipoint P = 0.0004) in whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In blacks, the strongest linkage was observed for baseline fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> on 12q13-q14 (empirical multipoint P = 0.0006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These regions harbor several potential candidate genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present findings may be important in identifying individuals at increased risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and who are most likely to benefit from a physically active lifestyle </plain></SENT>
