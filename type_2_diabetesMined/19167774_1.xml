<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: We aimed to investigate the impact of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> on cognitive performance and to explore the association between birth weight and cognitive performance among diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a standard oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test and a computerised test for assessment of cognitive performance (CogState) in 1243 subjects; 173 of them had type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the time of cognitive testing the mean age of the subjects was 64 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Subjects with known <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> performed significantly poorer in cognitive tasks measuring visual attention, working memory and episodic learning than subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subjects with newly diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or milder impairments in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> regulation did not differ from the normoglycaemic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birth weight</z:hpo> enhanced the association between <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and poor performance in the working memory and episodic learning tasks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Poorer cognitive performance was associated with known type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> but not with newly diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or milder impairments in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>Low birth weight</z:hpo> was found to be an additional vulnerability factor enhancing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> in diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
