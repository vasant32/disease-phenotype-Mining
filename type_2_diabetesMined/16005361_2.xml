<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> A-I (ApoA-I) stimulates the secretion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E (ApoE) from human macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ApoA-I is a major protein constituent of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> which because of its role in reverse cholesterol transport, has been implicated in the prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We herein investigated the ability of monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) in 42 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> to secrete ApoE; these patients commonly have low plasma <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> and ApoA-I levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our data showed that ApoE secretion from these cells was reduced in patients with low plasma <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> and ApoA-I levels; there were positive correlation between ApoE secretion from MDMs and plasma <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> (r2=0.33, p=0.03) and ApoA-I (r2=0.31, p=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we found that ApoE secretion increased concomitantly with an increase in <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> or ApoA-I in treated diabetics (n=24) from 1.99+/-1.86 to 3.40+/-1.77 ng/mg cell protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest another possible link between <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> and ApoA-I metabolism and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
