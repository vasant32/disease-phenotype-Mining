<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This is an observational cross-sectional study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Internists, cardiologists, and endocrinologists contributed patients to the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A standardized questionnaire was completed and registered demographics, anthropometric measurements, lab results from the medical files, and any treatment utilized to manage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e>, arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 1312 patients was included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 49.3 ± 14.6 years and 834 (63.6%) were female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The primary reason for the physician consultation was treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (47.5%), followed by management of arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (27.7%), <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (18.3%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> (14.2%), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (7.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients identified excess body weight as a health problem (81.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, patients had lost a mean of 4.3 ± 3.5 kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only 63.4% of patients with arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> were on drug therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Few of them had reached target values for diastolic (24.1%) and systolic/diastolic (13.3%) pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Less than half of the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> were receiving <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Only 32.2% were at their target <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, mean fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level (8.9 ± 3.4 mmol/L) was above the threshold recommended by current guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The study describes the medical care given to individuals with abdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> during daily clinical practice by general practitioners, cardiologists, and endocrinologists in urban Mexico </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Our data confirm that a large proportion of patients are undertreated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Only a small percentage of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-related comorbidities reach treatment targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Interventions proven to be effective in the prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> complications have in general not been implemented </plain></SENT>
