<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We randomized inpatients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>chronic renal failure</z:hpo> to treatment with two different dose levels of insulin glargine and glulisine and studied control of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> and the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, prospective, randomized trial to compare the efficacy of once-daily glargine and three-times daily glulisine at 0.5 vs. 0.25 units/kg/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 107 subjects had type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for &gt;1 year, had a glomerular filtration rate &lt;45 mL/min but did not require dialysis, and had an initial blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (BG) &gt;180 mg/dL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Doses were adjusted based on four-times daily BG measurements for 6 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean BG on the first day was 196 ± 71 mg/dL in the group receiving 0.5 units/kg (0.5 group) and 197 ± 55 mg/dL in the group receiving 0.25 units/kg (0.25 group; P = 0.94) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On days 2 to 6, mean BG was 174 ± 52 mg/dL in the 0.5 group and 174 ± 46 mg/dL in the 0.25 group (P = 0.96) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between groups in the percentage of BG values within the target range of 100 to 180 mg/dL on any of the 6 study days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the 0.5 group, 30% experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> (BG &lt;70 mg/dL) compared with 15.8% of the 0.25 group (P = 0.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Reduction of initial glargine/glulisine insulin weight-based dosing in hospitalized patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal insufficiency</z:hpo> reduced the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> by 50% without compromising the control of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
