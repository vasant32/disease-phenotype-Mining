<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some indices of insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity based on the results of OGTT were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The decline of insulin secretion capacity was significant throughout the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> from NGT via IGT to DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Decreased insulinogenic indices were conspicuous when it is compared with other types of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Slight impairment of insulin secretion has begun in subjects with NGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The progression from NGT via isolated IGT to isolated post-challenge <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> was considered mostly due to the deterioration of early-phase insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is summarized that <z:mp ids='MP_0003059'>decreased insulin secretion</z:mp> capacity takes a definite role in the development from NGT to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Japan </plain></SENT>
