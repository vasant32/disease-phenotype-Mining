<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This nonrandomized prospective intervention study used a one-group design to test the effectiveness of a community-based GLB intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Residents from 11 targeted neighborhoods were screened for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> (n = 573) and took part in a 12-week GLB intervention (n = 88) that addressed safe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and physical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A marked decline in weight (46.4% lost &gt; or = 5% and 26.1% lost or = 7%) was observed in individuals after completion of the intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these subjects, 87.5% (n = 28) and 66.7% (n = 12) sustained the 5% and 7% reduction, respectively, at the 6-month reassessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Over one-third of the population (43.5%, n = 30) experienced improvements in one or more component of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e>, and 73.3% (n = 22) sustained this improvement at the 6-month reassessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additional improvements occurred in waist circumference (P &lt; 0.009) and blood pressure levels (P = 0.04) after adjustment for age, sex, race, mean number of GLB classes attended, and time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Adults in an urban medically underserved community can decrease their risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> through participation in a GLB intervention, and short-term sustainability is feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Future research will include long-term follow-up of these subjects </plain></SENT>
