<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have demonstrated that podocyte injury is involved in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of and progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe a novel, highly sensitive ELISA for detecting urinary podocalyxin, a glycoconjugate on the podocyte apical surface that indicates podocyte injury, particularly in the early phase of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Urine samples from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268731" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">glomerular diseases</z:e> (n = 142) and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 71) were used to quantify urinary podocalyxin by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Urine samples were obtained from 69 healthy controls for whom laboratory data were within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Podocalyxin was detected in urine by immunofluorescence, immunoelectron microscopy and western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Morphologically, urinary podocalyxin was present as a vesicular structure; western blotting showed it as a positive band at 165-170 kDa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Levels of urinary podocalyxin were elevated in patients with various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268731" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">glomerular diseases</z:e> and patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, urinary podocalyxin was higher than the cut-off value in 53.8% patients at the normoalbuminuric stage, 64.7% at the microalbuminuric stage and 66.7% at the macroalbuminuric stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Positive correlations were observed between urinary podocalyxin levels and HbA(1c), urinary β(2) microglobulin, α(1) microglobulin and urinary N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-β-D-glucosaminidase, although urinary podocalyxin levels were not correlated with other laboratory markers such as blood pressure, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> level, serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, estimated GFR or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Urinary podocalyxin may be a useful biomarker for detecting early podocyte injury in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
