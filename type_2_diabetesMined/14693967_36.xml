<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In the Women's Health Study, a cohort of 39,345 U.S. women aged &gt;/=45 years with no previous history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> completed validated semiquantitative food frequency questionnaires in 1993 and were followed for an average of 6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used Cox proportional hazard models to estimate multivariate relative risks (RRs) of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> across quintiles of <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> intake compared with the lowest quintile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a sample of 349 apparently healthy women from this study, we measured plasma fasting insulin levels to examine their relation to <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During 222,523 person-years of follow-up, we documented 918 confirmed incident cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a significant inverse association between <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> intake and risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, independent of age and BMI (P = 0.007 for trend) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After further adjustment for physical activity, alcohol intake, smoking, family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and total calorie intake, the multivariate-adjusted RRs of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from the lowest to highest quintiles of <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> intake were attenuated at 1.0, 1.06, 0.81, 0.86, and 0.89 (P = 0.05 for trend) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among women with BMI &gt;/=25 kg/m2, the inverse trend was significant; multivariate-adjusted RRs were 1.0, 0.96, 0.76, 0.84, and 0.78 (P = 0.02 for trend) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate-adjusted geometric mean insulin levels for overweight women in the lowest quartile of <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> intake was 53.5 compared with 41.5 pmol/l among those at the highest quartile (P = 0.03 for trend) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings support a protective role of higher intake of <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> in reducing the risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, especially in overweight women </plain></SENT>
