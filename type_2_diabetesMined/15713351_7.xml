<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Evidence suggests that poor post-prandial blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control may contribute to vascular risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to examine whether the restoration of a more physiological insulin profile post-prandially would improve these abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients with insulin-treated Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were recruited into a single centre, crossover, double-blind study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomized to unmodified human insulin or insulin aspart before main meals for 6-week study periods, both together with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the end of each study period, pre-breakfast levels of markers of vascular risk were assessed and a test meal performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in HbA(1c) (7.04 +/- 0.13% (+/-S.E.) versus 7.15 +/- 0.11%, P = 0.060) with insulin aspart compared to human insulin at the end of each study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean post-prandial blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration at 90 min from self-monitored results was lower with insulin aspart than with human insulin (7.9 +/- 0.4 mmol/l versus 9.3 +/- 0.4 mmol/l, P = 0.011) as was study day post-prandial blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> at 90 min (8.4 +/- 0.5 mmol/l versus 9.2 +/- 0.6 mmol/l, P = 0.046) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found in fasting <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoproteins</z:chebi>, fibrinogen, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, E-selectin, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> between the two study periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Insulin aspart resulted in improved post-prandial glycaemic control when compared to human insulin in Type 2 diabetic patients, but this was not associated with changes in markers of vascular risk </plain></SENT>
