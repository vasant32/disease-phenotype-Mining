<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to explore the possible contribution of intramyocellular <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> content in the pathogenesis of skeletal muscle <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared insulin-resistant and insulin-sensitive subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To meet stringent matching criteria for other known confounders of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, these individuals were selected from an extensively metabolically characterized group of 280 first-degree relatives of type 2 diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Some 13 lean insulin-resistant and 13 lean insulin-sensitive subjects were matched for sex, age, BMI, percent body fat, physical fitness, and waist-to-hip ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity was determined by the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp method (for insulin-resistant subjects, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolic clearance rate [MCR] was 5.77+/-0.28 ml x kg(-1) x min(-1) [mean +/- SE]; for insulin-sensitive subjects, MCR was 10.15+/-0.7 ml x kg(-1) x min(-1); P&lt;0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was used to measure intramyocellular <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> content (IMCL) in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MRS studies demonstrated that in soleus muscle, IMCL was increased by 84% (11.8+/-1.6 vs. 6.4+/-0.59 arbitrary units; P = 0.008 ), and in tibialis anterior muscle, IMCL was increased by 57% (3.26+/-0.36 vs. 2.08+/-0.3 arbitrary units; P = 0.017) in the insulin-resistant offspring, whereas the extramyocellular <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> content and total muscle <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> content were not statistically different between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that in these well-matched groups of lean subjects, IMCL is increased in insulin-resistant offspring of type 2 diabetic subjects when compared with an insulin-sensitive group matched for age, BMI, body fat distribution, percent body fat, and degree of physical fitness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that increased IMCL represents an early abnormality in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and suggest that increased IMCL may contribute to the defective <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake in skeletal muscle in insulin-resistant subjects </plain></SENT>
