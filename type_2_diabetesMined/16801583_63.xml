<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine ethnic differences in risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, taking dietary and lifestyle risk factors into account </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A prospective (1980-2000) cohort (from The Nurses' Health Study) including 78,419 apparently healthy women (75,584 whites, 801 Asians, 613 Hispanics, and 1,421 blacks) was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Detailed dietary and lifestyle information for each participant was repeatedly collected every 4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During 1,294,799 person-years of follow-up, we documented 3,844 incident cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with whites, the age-adjusted relative risks (RRs) were 1.43 (95% CI 1.08-1.90) for Asians, 1.76 (1.32-2.34) for Hispanics, and 2.18 (1.82-2.61) for blacks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for BMI, the RRs changed to 2.26 (1.70-2.99) for Asians, 1.86 (1.40-2.47) for Hispanics, and 1.34 (1.12-1.61) for blacks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For each 5-unit increment in BMI, the multivariate RR of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 2.36 (1.83-3.04) for Asians, 2.21 (1.75-2.79) for Hispanics, 1.96 (1.93-2.00) for whites, and 1.55 (1.36-1.77) for blacks (P for interaction &lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For each 5-kg <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> between age 18 and the year 1980, the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was increased by 84% (95% CI 58-114) for Asians, 44% (26-63) for Hispanics, 38% (28-49) for blacks, and 37% (35-38%) for whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A healthy diet high in cereal fiber and polyunsaturated fat and low in trans fat and glycemic load was more strongly associated with a lower risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among minorities (RR 0.54 [95% CI 0.39-0.73]) than among whites (0.77 [0.72-0.84]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is significantly higher among Asians, Hispanics, and blacks than among whites before and after taking into account differences in BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>Weight gain</z:mp> is particularly detrimental for Asians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that the inverse association of a healthy diet with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is stronger for minorities than for whites </plain></SENT>
