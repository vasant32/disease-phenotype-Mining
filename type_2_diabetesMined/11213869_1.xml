<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether teaching free-living subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> how to incorporate added <z:chebi fb="96" ids="16646">sugars</z:chebi> or sweets into their daily meal plan results in a greater consumption of calories (fat or sugar) and deteriorates their glycemic or <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profiles but improves their perceived quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In an 8-month randomized controlled trial, 48 free-living subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were taught either a conventional (C) meal plan (no concentrated sweets) or one permitting as much as 10% of total energy as added <z:chebi fb="96" ids="16646">sugars</z:chebi> or sweets (S) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean individual nutrient intake was determined using the average of six 24-h telephone recalls per 4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Metabolic control and quality of life were evaluated every 2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Quality of life was assessed using the Medical Outcome Survey and the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Quality of Life questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The S group did not consume more calories (fat or sugar) and in fact ate significantly less carbohydrate (-15 vs. 10 g) and less <z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">starch</z:chebi> (-7 vs. 8 g) and had a tendency to eat fewer calories (-77 vs. 81 kcal) than the C group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Weight remained stable, and there was no evidence that consuming more sugar worsened metabolic profile or improved their perceived quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Giving individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> the freedom to include sugar in their daily meal plan had no negative impact on dietary habits or metabolic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Health professionals can be reassured and encouraged to teach the new "sugar guidelines," because doing so may result in a more conscientious carbohydrate consumption </plain></SENT>
