<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A correct diagnosis of MODY is important for determining treatment, but can only be confirmed by molecular genetic testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to compare the regional distribution of confirmed MODY cases in the UK and to estimate the minimum prevalence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: UK referrals for genetic testing in 2,072 probands and 1,280 relatives between 1996 and 2009 were examined by region, country and test result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Referral rate and prevalence were calculated using UK Census 2001 figures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MODY was confirmed in 1,177 (35%) patients, with HNF1A (52%) and GCK mutations (32%) being most frequent in probands confirmed with MODY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was considerable regional variation in proband referral rates (from &lt;20 per million in Wales and Northern Ireland to &gt;50 per million for South West England and Scotland) and patients diagnosed with MODY (5.3 per million in Northern Ireland, 48.9 per million in South West England) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Referral rates and confirmed cases were highly correlated (r = 0.96, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The minimum prevalence of MODY was estimated to be 108 cases per million </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Assuming this minimal prevalence throughout the UK then &gt;80% of MODY is not diagnosed by molecular testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The marked regional variation in the prevalence of confirmed MODY directly results from differences in referral rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This could reflect variation in awareness of MODY or unequal access to genetic testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Increased referral for diagnostic testing is required if the majority of MODY patients are to have the genetic diagnosis necessary for optimal treatment </plain></SENT>
