<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the association between 43 pathway-related candidate genes with 'intermediate phenotype' (i.e. corresponding plasma protein) and diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in a customised microarray of 1,536 SNPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this case-control study of type 2 diabetic Chinese individuals with and without diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, cases (n = 545) were defined on the basis of a spot urinary albumin/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio (ACR) &gt; 113 mg/mmol; the value for controls (n = 503) was ACR &lt; 3.3 mg/mmol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genotyping was performed using Illumina GoldenGate assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) remained significant in single locus analysis after correction for multiple testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we explored the best approximately 1% SNPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these 13 SNPs, four clustered to a 5' end <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase homologue 4 (NOX4) haplotype (GGCC frequency = 0.776) with estimated OR for diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> of 2.05 (95% CI 1.04-4.06) (heterozygous) and 2.48 (1.27-4.83) (homozygous) (p = 0.0055) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The haplotype was correlated with plasma Cu/Zn <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) concentration, suggesting increased oxidative burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Endothelin-1 SNP (rs1476046G&gt;A, frequency = 0.252) was correlated with plasma C-terminal pro-endothelin-1 concentrations with an estimated OR for diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> of (heterozygous) 1.26 (0.96-1.66) and (homozygous) 1.87 (1.13-3.12) (p = 0.0072) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase 1 (NOS1) 5' haplotype (TGTC frequency = 0.38) also revealed a suggestive association with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>: heterozygous 1.26 (0.95-1.67), homozygous 1.57 (1.04-2.35) (p = 0.0073) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A rare <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase homologue 1 (NOX1)-coding non-synonymous SNP (Arg315His, frequency = 0.006) was found exclusively among cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our preliminary observations suggest that common haplotypes from NOX4 and endothelin-1 SNP correlated with plasma Cu/Zn SOD and C-terminal pro-endothelin-1 concentrations, respectively, and might have conferred diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> susceptibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Common NOS1 and rare NOX1 variants also revealed a suggestive association with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Future studies to validate our observation are needed </plain></SENT>
