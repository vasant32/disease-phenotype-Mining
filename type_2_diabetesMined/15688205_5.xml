<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To define the effects of insulin treatment on body composition and fat distribution, and investigate the potential role of body weight (BWt) gain predictors in patients with poorly controlled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Assessments of body composition, using a four-component model, and biochemical indices were obtained in 19 patients [mean (SD): age, 60 (8.3) years; BMI, 25.3 (3.3) kg/m(2)] with poorly controlled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, despite maximal oral hypoglycaemic agents, receiving insulin [40 (12.2) units/day] at baseline and after 1, 3 and 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Insulin therapy significantly reduced plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> [-6.0 (4.3) mmol/l], improved [HbA(1)c [-1.9 (1.8)%], and reversed the BWt lost [3.3 (1.8) kg] before treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 6-month BWt gain [+5.2 (2.7) kg] consisted of body fat [+2.9 (2.7) kg] and fat-free mass [FFM; +2.3 (1.8) kg], with the FFM increase due solely to total body water [TBW; +2.4 (1.5) l], as there were no detectable changes in total body protein or bone mineral, thereby increasing FFM hydration by 1.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>More body fat was deposited centrally in patients receiving insulin alone than those receiving insulin with an oral hypoglycaemic agent (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Daily insulin dose, HbA(1)c and hip circumference were independent predictors of BWt gain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Insulin treatment increased fat and FFM similarly in poorly controlled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients, with the FFM gain due entirely to TBW </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The possible role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> in reducing central fat accumulation following insulin treatment warrants further investigation into its mechanism and potential long-term benefits </plain></SENT>
