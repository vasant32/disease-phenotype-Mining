<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To characterize metabolic effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> in type 2 diabetic, <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, and lean subjects, and examine the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> 2-3 weeks after discontinuation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Nine type 2 diabetic, nine <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, and nine lean subjects underwent baseline metabolic studies including an 8-h meal-tolerance test (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>) and a 5-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects then received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> (600 mg/day) for 12 weeks and subsequently had repeat metabolic studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diabetic subjects remained off <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi> for 2-3 weeks and then underwent a 5-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In diabetic subjects, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was reduced (P&lt;0.05) and insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal (Rd) was enhanced by treatment (P&lt;0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The area under the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> 8-h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> curve declined with therapy (P&lt;0.001), and its change was positively correlated with the improvement in Rd (r = 0.75, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was also a positive correlation between the change in fasting hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> output (HGO) and the change in fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> with treatment (r = 0.92, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Discontinuation of therapy for 2-3 weeks did not significantly affect fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> or insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> Rd </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects, insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> Rd improved with therapy (P&lt;0.001), allowing for maintenance of euglycemia by lower plasma insulin concentrations (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In lean subjects, an increase in fasting HGO (P&lt;0.001) and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> clearance (P&lt;0.01) was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">Troglitazone</z:chebi> lowers fasting and postprandial plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by affecting both fasting HGO and peripheral insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Its effects are evident 2-3 weeks after discontinuation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects, its insulin sensitizing effects suggest a role for its use in the primary prevention of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
