<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After phosphorylation by activated receptors, these intracellular signaling molecules recruit various downstream effector pathways including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Grb2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ablation of the IRS-2 gene produces a diabetic phenotype; mice lacking IRS-2 display peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta-cell dysfunction</z:hpo> characterized by a 50% reduction in beta-cell mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, deletion of IRS-1 retards somatic growth and enhances beta-cell mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IRS1-/- mice are 50% smaller than controls but have a twofold increase in pancreatic beta-cell mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, observations from these recently developed animal models implicate the IRS signaling systems in the response of classical insulin target tissues, and they suggest a critical role for these proteins in the regulation of beta-cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In humans, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> generally occurs when insulin-secretory reserves fail to compensate for peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Study and identification of the signals downstream of IRS proteins in beta-cells may provide unique insights into the compensatory mechanisms by which these cells respond to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the intent of this review is to summarize recent observations regarding the regulation of beta-cell function by members of the IRS protein family </plain></SENT>
