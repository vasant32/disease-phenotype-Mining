<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1alpha, HNF-4alpha, glucokinase (GCK), and HNF-1beta genes cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0004904'>maturity-onset diabetes of the young</z:hpo> (MODY), but it is not known whether common variants in these genes predict future type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We tested 14 previously associated polymorphisms in HNF-1alpha, HNF-4alpha, GCK, and HNF-1beta for association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related traits and future risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in 2,293 individuals from the Botnia study (Finland) and in 15,538 individuals from the Malm√∂ Preventive Project (Sweden) with a total follow-up &gt;360,000 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The polymorphism rs1169288 in HNF-1alpha strongly predicted future type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (hazard ratio [HR] 1.2, P = 0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Also, SNPs rs4810424 and rs3212198 in HNF-4alpha nominally predicted future type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (HR 1.3 [95% CI 1.0-1.6], P = 0.03; and 1.1 [1.0-1.2], P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rs2144908 polymorphism in HNF-4alpha was associated with elevated rate of hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production during a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (P = 0.03) but not with deterioration of insulin secretion over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The SNP rs1799884 in the GCK promoter was associated with elevated fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (fPG) concentrations that remained unchanged during the follow-up period (P = 0.4; SE 0.004 [-0.003-0.007]) but did not predict future type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (HR 0.9 [0.8-1.0], P = 0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Polymorphisms in HNF-1beta (transcription factor 2 [TCF2]) did not significantly influence insulin or <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> values nor did they predict future type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, genetic variation in both HNF-1alpha and HNF-4alpha predict future type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, whereas variation in the GCK promoter results in a sustained but subtle elevation of fPG that is not sufficient to increase risk for future type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
