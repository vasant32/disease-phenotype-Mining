<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients were explored for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo>, cardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0259749" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autonomic neuropathy</z:e> (n = 512), and silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e> (n = 506).RESULTSMacroproteinuria was the only complication that was associated with G-Gap (prevalence in the first, second, and third tertile of G-Gap: 2.9, 6.2, and 11.0%, respectively; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The G-Gap was higher in patients with macroproteinuria than in those without (1.06 ± 1.62 vs. 0.03 ± 1.30%; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because HbA(1c) was associated with both G-Gap (HbA(1c) 7.0 ± 1.4, 7.9 ± 1.4, and 10.1 ± 1.8% in the first, second, and third G-Gap tertile, respectively; P &lt; 0.0001) and macroproteinuria (HbA(1c) 8.8 ± 2.2% if macroproteinuria, 8.3 ± 2.0% if none; P &lt; 0.05), and because it could have been a confounder, we matched 54 patients with macroproteinuria and 200 patients without for HbA(1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because macroproteinuria was associated with lower serum albumin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24103">fructosamine</z:chebi> levels, which might account for higher G-Gap, we calculated in this subpopulation albumin-indexed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24103">fructosamine</z:chebi> and G-Gap; macroproteinuria was independently associated with male gender (odds ratio [OR], 3.2; 95% CI, 1.5-6.7; P &lt; 0.01), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (2.9; [1.1-7.5]; P &lt; 0.05), and the third tertile of albumin-indexed G-Gap (2.3; [1.1-4.4]; P &lt; 0.05) in multivariate analysis.CONCLUSIONIn type 2 diabetic patients, G-Gap was associated with macroproteinuria, independently of HbA(1c), albumin levels, and confounding factors, suggesting a specific role of intracellular glycation susceptibility on kidney glomerular changes </plain></SENT>
