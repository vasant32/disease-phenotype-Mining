<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we examine the three polymorphisms in 1,594 Scandinavian subjects, including 409 type 2 diabetic patients, 200 glucose-tolerant control subjects, 322 young healthy subjects, 206 glucose-tolerant offspring of diabetic patients, and 457 glucose-tolerant 70-year-old men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the 112/121 combination was not significantly different in 409 type 2 diabetic subjects compared with 200 glucose-tolerant control subjects (0.06 vs. 0.05; odds ratio 1.32 [95% CI 0.58-3.30]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-tolerant subjects, neither the single-nucleotide polymorphisms individually nor the 112/121 combination were associated with alterations in plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, serum insulin, or serum C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels at fasting or during an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test, estimates of insulin sensitivity, or <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the frequency of the 112/121 at-risk haplotype of CAPN10 is low among Scandinavians and we were unable to demonstrate significant associations between the CAPN10 variants and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948379" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">impaired insulin secretion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
