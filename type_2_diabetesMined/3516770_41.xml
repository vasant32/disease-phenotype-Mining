<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Irrespective of weight changes, high concurrent and high past body mass index values (greater than or equal to 27) were associated with similarly increased rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> as compared with body mass index values less than 27 at both time-points (rate ratio 1.76, 90% confidence limits 1.56-1.99) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>Glucose intolerance</z:hpo> here includes borderline and impaired tolerance as well as Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rate of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> increased only with increasing past body mass index, while concurrent body mass index had no effect [rate ratios: 2.36 (1.48-3.75) and 1.99 (1.48-2.68) respectively for the medium-(23-26.9) versus-low (less than 23) and high- (greater than or equal to 27) versus-medium past body-mass-index categories] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Weight reduction was associated with only slightly reduced rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> and had no effect on the rate of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean sum insulin (summed 1 and 2 h levels, mU/l) increased significantly with increasing concurrent body mass index (123, 150 and 190 in the low, medium and high categories) with no effect of past body mass index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It also increased significantly (p less than 0.001) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> concurrent body mass index categories from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tolerance through borderline to impaired tolerance, and decreased significantly (p less than 0.001) in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> relative to impaired tolerance, although it remained above <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
