<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Participants fasting &lt;8 h, with diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, or taking blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> or blood <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering medications were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both phenotypes were adjusted separately by race and sex for the effects of age, BMI, and field center before linkage scans using 370 microsatellite markers were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 685 white families (1,180 sibpairs) and 773 black families (775 sibpairs) were evaluated as well as subsets including 267 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> white families (757 sibpairs) and 427 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> black families (599 sibpairs) identified through tree-linkage analyses using interacting covariates of age, sex, and BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For beta-cell function in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> white families, significant (logarithm of odds [LOD] score &gt;3.6) evidence supporting linkages was detected on chromosome 8q24 at D8S1179 (135 cM, LOD score 4.2, empirical P = 0.002) and at D8S1128 (140 cM, LOD score 3.7, empirical P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, two regions supported linkage for insulin sensitivity index in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> black families on chromosome 7q11 at D7S3046 (79 cM, LOD score 3.0, empirical P = 0.018) and on chromosome 6q26 at D6S1277 (173 cM, LOD score 3.0, empirical P = 0.018) </plain></SENT>
