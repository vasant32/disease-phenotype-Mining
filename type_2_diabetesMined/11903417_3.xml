<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: NANSY is a randomised, placebo-controlled Swedish-Norwegian study which aims to include 2 x 1112 male and female subjects with impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (IFG), to assess whether conversion to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> can be delayed by addition of sulphonylurea to dietary regulation and increased exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This pilot study was conducted to find the optimum dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> in NANSY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a double blind trial in primary care 25 IFG subjects were in random order exposed to single doses and one-week treatments with 0 (placebo), 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> once daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The optimum dose was assessed by measuring blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> during oral 75 g <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT), comparing fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and the area under the blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> curve (AUC), and by monitoring hypoglycaemic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: With single doses, there was a clear dose-response relationship for the reduction in AUC, with a statistically significant difference only between placebo (mean 1981, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1883-2078) and 2 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> (mean 1763, 95% CI 1665-1861) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, following 1-week treatments, the only significant difference was between placebo (mean 1934, 95% CI 1856-2012) and 1 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> (mean 1714, 95% CI 1637-1792) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Correspondingly, the only statistically significant difference in fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> day 7 was between placebo (5.87 mmol/l, 95% CI 5.68-6.05 mmol/l) and 1 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> (5.42 mmol/l, 95% CI 5.21-5.62 mmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Chemical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> was common but hypoglycaemic symptoms were rare and similar between the active doses, and easily countered by the subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The sulphonylurea dose-effect curve may be bell-shaped, perhaps due to down regulation of sulphonylurea receptors during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, the finding could be a rebound phenomenon, secondary to preceding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The optimum dose for NANSY was found to be 1 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
