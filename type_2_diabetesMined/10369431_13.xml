<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reviewed epidemiological and clinical data of this patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 28 patients (55%) have type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 18 (35%) have type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and for five patients, we were unable to determine the type of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The majority have positive family histories of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (83%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The average age at diagnosis was 12.4 years for type 1 and 19.1 years for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and mean current HbA1c were not statistically different between the two groups, yet <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> was present in 62% of type 2 patients, but only 18% of the type 1 group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These statistics show that a significant number of Northland NZ Maori develop type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at an earlier age than expected and have a high incidence of renal complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings contrast with previous New Zealand studies on the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in young Maori, but are similar to those of recent overseas studies of ethnic groups with a high incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
