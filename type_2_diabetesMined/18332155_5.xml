<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data on a cohort of 14,500 male veterans with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diagnoses of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were based on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9 codes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Persistent recognition was defined as an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9 code for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> documented in at least the second or third visit after the initial diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hazards of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were compared using Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusting for relevant covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over 10 years, 2,305 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mortality risk was higher for depressed than nondepressed veterans with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (hazard ratio [HR] 1.6 [95% CI 1.3-1.8]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, mortality risk was lower with persistent recognition (0-2 visits vs. &gt;or=3 visits after initial diagnosis, HR 0.58 [0.40-0.89]) but higher for whites than blacks (1.60 [1.11-2.31]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Increased mortality from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> differs by ethnicity and persistent recognition </plain></SENT>
