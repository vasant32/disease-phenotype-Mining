<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 159 African-American patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were assessed on three domains of family life (structure/organization, world view, and emotion management) and three key dimensions of disease management (morale, management behaviors, and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> regulation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analyses assessed the associations of family factors with disease management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Multivariate tests for the main effects of three family variables were significantly related to the block of disease management variables for morale (F=3.82; df=12,363; P &lt;0.0001) and behavior (2.12; 9,329; P &lt;0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Structural togetherness in families was positively related to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> quality of life (DQOL)-Satisfaction (P &lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High family coherence, a world view that life is meaningful and manageable, was positively associated with general health (P &lt;0.05) and DQOL-Impact (P &lt;0.05) and negatively associated with depressive symptoms (P &lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Emotion management, marked by unresolved <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233542" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">family conflict</z:e> about <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, was related to more depressive symptoms (P &lt;0.001), lower DQOL-Satisfaction (P &lt;0.01), and lower DQOL-Impact (P &lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No family measures were related to HbA1c levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The family domain of emotion management demonstrates the strongest associations with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> management in African-American patients, followed by family beliefs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patient morale is the aspect of disease management that seems most related to family context </plain></SENT>
