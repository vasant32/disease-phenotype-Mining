<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of nateglinide and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> alone and in combination in type 2 diabetic patients inadequately controlled by diet, focusing on changes in HbA1c, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG), and mealtime <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excursions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this randomized double-blind study, patients with an HbA1c level between 6.8 and 11.0% during a 4-week placebo run-in received 24 weeks' treatment with 120 mg nateglinide before meals (n = 179), 500 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> three times a day (n = 178), combination therapy (n = 172), or placebo (n = 172) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HbA1c and FPG were evaluated regularly, and plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were determined after Sustacal challenge at weeks 0, 12, and 24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>Hypoglycemia</z:hpo> and other adverse events were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At study end point, HbA1c was reduced from baseline with nateglinide and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> but was increased with placebo (-0.5, -0.8, and +0.5%, respectively; P &lt; or = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Changes in FPG followed the same pattern (-0.7, -1.6, and +0.4 mmol/l; P &lt; or = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Combination therapy was additive (HbA1c -1.4% and FPG -2.4 mmol/l; P &lt; or = 0.01 vs. monotherapy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After Sustacal challenge, there was a greater reduction in mealtime <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> with nateglinide monotherapy compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy or placebo (adjusted area under the curve [AUC]0-130 min -2.1, -1.1, and -0.6 mmol x h(-1) x l(-1); p &lt; or = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An even greater effect was observed with combination therapy (AUC0-130 min -2.5 mmol x h(-1) x l(-1); P &lt; or = 0.0001 vs. <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and placebo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> regimens were well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Nateglinide and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy each improved overall glycemic control but by different mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nateglinide decreased mealtime <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excursions, whereas <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> primarily affected FPG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In combination, nateglinide and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> had complementary effects, improving HbA1c, FPG, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011998'>postprandial hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
