<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that oral administration of soybean-derived pinitol would improve insulin sensitivity in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects (BMI = 36.6 kg/m2) with diet-treated type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> (HbA1c = 6.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: There were 22 subjects randomized to receive either pinitol 20 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) (n = 12) or placebo (n = 10) in a 28-day double-blinded trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No toxicity due to the pinitol was observed during the study The sensitivity of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism to insulin were assessed by measurement of whole-body <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> kinetics during basal conditions and a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Metabolic measurements were made at baseline and again at the end of the study Final plasma levels of pinitol were 48-fold (1.06 +/- 0.15 vs. 0.02 +/- 0.01 micromol/l, P &lt; 0.0001) and D-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="23098">chiro-inositol</z:chebi> levels 14-fold (0.56 +/- 0.08 vs. 0.04 +/- 0.02 micromol/l, P &lt; 0.0001) greater in the pinitol group compared with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Four weeks of pinitol treatment did not alter baseline <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production, insulin-mediated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal, or rates of appearance of free fatty acids and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> in plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that plasma levels of both pinitol and D-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="23098">chiro-inositol</z:chebi> are very responsive to pinitol ingestion, but insulin sensitivity does not increase after pinitol treatment in individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and mild type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
