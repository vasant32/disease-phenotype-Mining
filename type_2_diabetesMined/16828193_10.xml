<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study addressed the association of C677T and A1298C single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of MTHFR gene with DN in Tunisian type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2DM) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Study subjects comprised 93 DN patients, 267 patients with normoalbuminuria, and 400 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>C677T and A1298C genotypes were determined by PCR-RFLP analysis, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels were measured by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A1298C and C677T were highly prevalent among T2DM patients, with allele frequencies of 0.26 and 0.36, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Higher mutant 677T allele and 677C/T and 677T/T genotypes of C677T SNP, but not A1298C SNP, together with 677C/1298A, 677C/1298C, and 677T/1298A haplotypes were seen in DN patients compared to normoalbuminuric patients, (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> was positively associated with MTHFR 677T/T genotype among the three groups, and was significantly elevated in double heterozygous DN patients but not in normoalbuminuric patients or controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis with DN as dependent variable showed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> (OR, 1.153) and MTHFR 677T/T (OR, 9.799) were the only variables associated with DN, after adjusting for possible confounding variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>C677T, but not A1298C, SNP, is a risk factor for DN, presumably acting by elevating <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
