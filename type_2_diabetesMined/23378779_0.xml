<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The treatment is lifestyle management, exercise, weight control, and antihyperglycemic drugs such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3095">biguanides</z:chebi>, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi>, and meglitinide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, a direct association between high levels of C-reactive protein and serum <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> deaminase levels in patients with uncontrolled <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with long-term complications has been seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to assess the antihyperglycemic, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering, anti-inflammatory, and improving glycemic control of garlic in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was an open-label, prospective, comparative study, conducted on 60 patients having type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into two groups of 30 each, of either sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Group 1 was given <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> tablets, 500 mg twice a day (BD)/three times a day (TDS), after meals, and group 2 was given <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> tablets, 500 mg BD/TDS, after meals, along with garlic (Allium sativum) capsules, 250 mg BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients were routinely investigated for fasting and postprandial blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA(1c)), serum <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> deaminase levels and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile (serum cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi>) at the start of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed up for 12 weeks, with monitoring of fasting and postprandial blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> at 2 week intervals, and monitoring of the other parameters at the end of study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Data obtained at the end of the study was statistically analyzed using Student's t test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: It was observed that both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> alone and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> with garlic reduced fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and postprandial blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> significantly, with a greater percentage reduction with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> plus garlic; however, change in HbA(1c) levels was not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A fall in total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> and an increase in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> were more pronounced in patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> plus garlic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Similarly, a fall in C-reactive protein and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> deaminase levels was greater in patients taking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> with garlic than in patients taking only <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Garlic has been shown to have antihyperglycemic and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The additional lowering of C-reactive protein and serum <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> deaminase levels with garlic suggests that garlic can be a valuable agent in providing good glycemic control and the prevention of long-term complications </plain></SENT>
