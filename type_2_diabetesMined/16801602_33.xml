<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Studies that were included targeted interventions toward socially disadvantaged adults with type 1 or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; were conducted in industrialized countries; were measured outcomes of self-management, provider management, or clinical outcomes; and were randomized controlled trials, controlled trials, or before-and-after studies with a contemporaneous control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seven databases were searched for articles published in any language between January 1986 and December 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six intervention features were identified and analyzed in terms of their association with successful or unsuccessful interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eleven of 17 studies that met inclusion criteria had positive results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Features that appeared to have the most consistent positive effects included cultural tailoring of the intervention, community educators or lay people leading the intervention, one-on-one interventions with individualized assessment and reassessment, incorporating treatment algorithms, focusing on behavior-related tasks, providing feedback, and high-intensity interventions (&gt;10 contact times) delivered over a long duration (&gt;or=6 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interventions that were consistently associated with the largest negative outcomes included those that used mainly didactic teaching or that focused only on <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> knowledge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review provides evidence for the effectiveness of interventions to improve <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care among socially disadvantaged populations and identifies key intervention features that may predict success </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These types of interventions would require additional resources for needs assessment, leader training, community and family outreach, and follow-up </plain></SENT>
