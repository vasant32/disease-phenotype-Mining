<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Since <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> improves insulin sensitivity, it has been indicated for patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, which are insulin-resistant conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast to its well-known effects on carbohydrate metabolism, its potential for reducing blood pressure (BP) and its effect on leptin levels have been investigated less frequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was carried out with 26 overweight diabetic subjects with mild-to-moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> to assess the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>-induced glycaemic control on BP and metabolic parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After a 4-week placebo period, when BP was stabilized by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38215">calcium channel blockers</z:chebi>, they received either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (MG) or placebo (PG) for 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Neither group showed any change in weight throughout the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>-treated patients reduced fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (8.54 + 1.72 to 7.54 + 1.33 mmol/l, p &lt; 0.05), although HbA(1c) had decreased in both groups (PG: 6.7+/-3.0 to 5.9+/-2.6%; MG: 5.3+/-1.5 to 4.6+/-0.9%; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The initial office mean BPs were similar and decreased at the end of the treatment period in both groups, reaching statistical significance only in MG (105.7+/-8.0 to 99.2+/-9.3 mmHg, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No difference was observed when comparing baseline and final values obtained by 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> induced a reduction in both insulinaemia (71.0+/-62.4 to 38.0+/-23.0 pmol/l, p &lt; 0.05) and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> index (3.5+/-2.7 to 1.8+/-1.0, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The two groups had similar baseline leptin levels which remained unchanged after treatment (PG: 16.8+/-7.9 to 21.4+/-14.6 microg/l; MG: 18.5+/-10.3 to 18.4+/-8.9 microg/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">Dopamine</z:chebi> levels increased significantly only in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>-treated subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Reductions in both the insulin levels and the resistance index reinforced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> capacity to improve peripheral sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Moreover, such benefits were not accompanied by any hypotensive effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Since leptin levels were affected neither by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> per se nor by the induced insulinaemia reduction, our data support the role of body weight as the major determinant of circulating leptin levels </plain></SENT>
