<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several lines of evidence suggest dietary factors other than protein intake have a substantial role in the progression of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present investigation was initiated to evaluate whether a carbohydrate-restricted, low-iron-available, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26195">polyphenol</z:chebi>-enriched (CR-LIPE) diet may delay and improve the outcome of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> to a greater extent than standard protein restriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To this aim, 191 diabetic patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, were randomized to either CR-LIPE or standard protein restriction and the following outcomes monitored: doubling of serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, cumulative incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal disease</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cause mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Over a mean follow-up interval of 3.9 +/- 1.8 years, serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> concentration doubled in 19 patients on CR-LIPE (21%) and in 31 control subjects (39%) (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Renal replacement therapy or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurred in 18 patients on CR-LIPE (20%) and in 31 control subjects (39%) (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These differences were independent from follow-up interval, sex, mean arterial blood pressure, HbA(1c), initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo>, and angiotensin system inhibitor use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, CR-LIPE was 40-50% more effective than standard protein restriction in improving renal and overall survival rates </plain></SENT>
