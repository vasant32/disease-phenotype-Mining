<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: White, black, Hispanic, and Chinese adults, aged 45-84 years and free of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, completed food frequency questionnaires at baseline (2000-2002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was defined at three follow-up exams (2002-2003, 2004-2005, and 2005-2007) as fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &gt;126 mg/dl, self-reported type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, or use of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two types of dietary patterns were studied: four empirically derived (principal components analysis) and one author-defined (low-risk food pattern) as the weighted sum of whole grains, vegetables, nuts/seeds, low-fat dairy, coffee (positively weighted), red meat, processed meat, high-fat dairy, and soda (negatively weighted) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The empirically derived dietary pattern characterized by high intake of tomatoes, beans, refined grains, high-fat dairy, and red meat was associated with an 18% greater risk (hazard ratio per 1-score SD 1.18 [95% CI 1.06-1.32]; P(trend) = 0.004), whereas the empirically derived dietary pattern characterized by high intake of whole grains, fruit, nuts/seeds, green leafy vegetables, and low-fat dairy was associated with a 15% lower <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk (0.85 [0.76-0.95]; P(trend) = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The low-risk food pattern was also inversely associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk (0.87 [0.81-0.99]; P(trend) = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Individual component food groups were not independently associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Associations were not modified by sex or race/ethnicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Multiple food groups collectively influence type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk beyond that of the individual food groups themselves </plain></SENT>
