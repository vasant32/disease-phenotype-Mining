<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to determine the direct effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> in hepatocytes and to test the hypothesis that atypical antipsychotic drugs that predispose to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> counter-regulate the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rat hepatocytes were studied in short-term primary culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">Serotonin</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>) stimulated <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthesis at nanomolar concentrations but inhibited it at micromolar concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The stimulatory effect was mimicked by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48295">alpha-methyl-5-HT</z:chebi>, a mixed 5-HT1/5-HT2 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, whereas the inhibition was counteracted by a 5-HT2B/2C receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="48295">alpha-Methyl-5-HT</z:chebi> stimulated <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthesis additively with insulin, but unlike insulin, did not stimulate <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> phosphorylation and glycolysis, nor did it cause Akt (protein kinase B) phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Stimulation of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthesis by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48295">alpha-methyl-5-HT</z:chebi> correlated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of phosphorylase a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This effect could not be explained by elevated levels of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> 6-phosphate, which causes inactivation of phosphorylase, but was explained, at least in part, by decreased phosphorylase kinase activity in situ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The antipsychotic drugs <z:chebi fb="35" ids="3766">clozapine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7735">olanzapine</z:chebi>, which bind to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> receptors, counteracted the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48295">alpha-methyl-5-HT</z:chebi> on phosphorylase inactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: This study provides evidence for both stimulation and inhibition of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthesis in hepatocytes by serotonergic mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The former effects are associated with the inactivation of phosphorylase and are counteracted by atypical antipsychotic drugs that cause hepatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Antagonism of hepatic serotonergic mechanisms may be a component of the hepatic dysregulation caused by antipsychotic drugs that predispose to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
