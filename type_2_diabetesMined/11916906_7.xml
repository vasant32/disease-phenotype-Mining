<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HNF-4alpha, which is a transcription factor expressed in pancreatic beta-cells, plays an important role in regulating the expression of genes involved in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, cofactors that interact with HNF-4alpha and modify its transcriptional activity might also play an important role in regulating the metabolic pathways in pancreatic beta-cells, and the genes of such cofactors are plausible candidate genes for MODY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we showed, using a yeast two-hybrid screening assay, that thyroid hormone receptor interacting protein 3 (Trip3) interacted with HNF-4alpha, and their interaction was confirmed by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> S-transferase pull-down assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Human Trip3 cDNA contained an open reading frame for a protein of 155 amino acids, and the gene was expressed in both pancreatic islets and MIN6 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cotransfection experiments indicated that Trip3 could enhance (two- to threefold) the transcription activity of HNF-4alpha in COS-7 cells and MIN6 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that Trip3 is a coactivator of HNF-4alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mutation screening revealed that variation of the Trip3 gene is not a common cause of MODY/early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Japanese individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Trip3 may play an important role in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism by regulating the transcription activity of HNF-4alpha </plain></SENT>
