<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted an 8-month randomized controlled double-blind study among diabetic patients with poor <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control (HbA1c &gt;9.0%) in an urban area of South Auckland, New Zealand, with a high proportion of Maori and Pacific Islands people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects included 68 consecutive patients, of whom 50% were prescribed three or more medications per day RESULTS: HbA1c was reduced by 0.95+/-0.22% in the CBP group and 0.15+/-0.25% in the control group (P = 0.026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diastolic blood pressure decreased 5.8+/-1.5 mm Hg in the CBP group and increased 0.1+/-1.9 mm Hg in the control group (P = 0.0041) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Systolic blood pressure did not change significantly CONCLUSIONS: CBPs should be considered among diabetic patients with poor glycemic control receiving multiple medications </plain></SENT>
