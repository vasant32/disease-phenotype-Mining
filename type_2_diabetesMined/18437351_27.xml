<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To get a better estimation of the true risk conferred by these novel loci, we tested a completely unselected population of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients from a Norwegian health survey (the HUNT study) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We genotyped single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in PKN2, IGFBP2, FLJ39370 (also known as C4ORF32), CDKAL1, SLC30A8, CDKN2B, HHEX and FTO using a Norwegian population-based sample of 1,638 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 1,858 non-diabetic control participants (the HUNT Study), for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom data on BMI, WHR, cholesterol and triacylglycerol levels were available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, measures of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> values as phenotypes in case-control and quantitative association study designs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We replicated the association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for rs10811661 in the vicinity of CDKN2B (OR 1.20, 95% CI: 1.06-1.37, p=0.004), rs9939609 in FTO (OR 1.14, 95% CI: 1.04-1.25, p=0.006) and rs13266634 in SLC30A8 (OR 1.20, 95% CI: 1.09-1.33, p=3.9 x 10(-4)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found borderline significant association for the IGFBP2 SNP rs4402960 (OR 1.10, 95% CI: 0.99-1.22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results for the HHEX SNP (rs1111875) and the CDKAL1 SNP (rs7756992) were non-significant, but the magnitude of effect was similar to previous estimates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found no support for an association with the less consistently replicated FLJ39370 or PKN2 SNPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In agreement with previous studies, FTO was most strongly associated with BMI (p=8.4 x 10(-4)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our data show that SNPs near IGFBP2, CDKAL1, SLC30A8, CDKN2B, HHEX and FTO are also associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in non-selected patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
