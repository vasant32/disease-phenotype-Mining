<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated whether a diet high in fatty fish, bilberries and wholegrain products (Healthy Diet) improves biomarkers reflecting <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> in individuals with impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We recruited individuals with impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism and features of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> into a 12 week, parallel design, dietary intervention trial conducted at the Department of Clinical Nutrition, University of Eastern Finland (Kuopio, Finland) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Randomisation was performed by matching according to sex and medians of age, BMI and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> of the study population at screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint in the present study was the change in plasma inflammatory markers and the measurements were performed blinded to group assignment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High-sensitivity (hs) C-reactive protein (CRP) and E-selectin responses were also analysed separately in participants not using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> (n = 76) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Altogether, 131 individuals were assigned to either the Healthy Diet (n = 44), a whole-grain-enriched diet (WGED) (n = 42) or a control (n = 45) diet, and 104 participants (mean ± SD: age 59 ± 7 years; BMI 31.1 ± 3.5 kg/m(2)) who had completed the study, were analysed (Healthy Diet n = 36, WGED n = 34 and control diet n = 34) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasma E-selectin decreased only in the Healthy Diet group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This occurred in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> group participants (p &lt; 0.05) and also after excluding participants using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Plasma hsCRP levels decreased in the Healthy Diet (median -17%, p &lt; 0.05) and WGED (median -27%, p &lt; 0.01) groups in participants not using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Controlling for confounding factors, including BMI or insulin sensitivity, did not alter the results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A greater increase in plasma concentration of very-long-chain n-3 fatty acids and in the intake of fibre during the study was associated with a greater decrease in plasma E-selectin (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The intake of test breads consumed during the Healthy Diet and WGED interventions was inversely associated with the change in hsCRP levels (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that the combined effect of fatty fish, bilberries and wholegrain products may improve <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in overweight and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals at high risk of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
