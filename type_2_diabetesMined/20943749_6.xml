<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: A strong association between genetic variants and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> was found for the fat mass and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-associated gene (FTO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, few details are known concerning the expression and function of FTO in skeletal muscle of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We investigated basal FTO expression in skeletal muscle from <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> nondiabetic subjects and type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients, compared with age-matched control subjects, and its regulation in vivo by insulin, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The function of FTO was further studied in myotubes by overexpression experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found a significant increase of FTO <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels in muscle from type 2 diabetic patients, whereas its expression was unchanged in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> or type 1 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, insulin or <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion during specific clamps did not regulate FTO expression in skeletal muscle from control or type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> treatment improved insulin sensitivity and reduced FTO expression in muscle from type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In myotubes, adenoviral FTO overexpression increased basal protein kinase B phosphorylation, enhanced lipogenesis and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, and reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> oxidative function, a cluster of metabolic defects associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates increased FTO expression in skeletal muscle from type 2 diabetic patients, which can be normalized by thiazolidinedione treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in vitro data support a potential implication of FTO in oxidative metabolism, lipogenesis and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in muscle, suggesting that it could be involved in the muscle defects that characterize type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
