<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of serum visfatin, adiponectin and leptin with 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) in the context of the role of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, which is not well understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 76 newly-diagnosed T2DM patients and 76 healthy control subjects, matched for age, body mass index (BMI) and sex ratio, were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anthropometric parameters, glycemic and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (measured by homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> index [HOMA-IR]), leptin, adiponectin, and visfatin were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On the contrary to adiponectin, serum leptin and visfatin levels were higher in T2DM patients compared with controls (10.07 ± 4.5, 15.87 ± 16.4, and 5.49 ± 2.4 vs. 12.22 ± 4.9 μg/ml, 8.5 ± 7.8 ng/ml and 3.58 ± 2.2 ng/ml, respectively, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Waist circumference and BMI were correlated with leptin and adiponectin but not with visfatin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Leptin, adiponectin and visfatin <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were associated with T2DM following adjusting for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After controlling for HOMA-IR, visfatin remained as an independent predictor of T2DM (odds ratio=1.32, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a multiple regression analysis to determine visfatin only <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> and fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> remained in the model (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Elevation of visfatin in T2DM is independent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and is mainly determined by fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
