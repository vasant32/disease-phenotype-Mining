<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and locus transferability of 40 reported T2D loci in six AfA GWAS consisting of 2,806 T2D case subjects with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal disease</z:hpo> and 4,265 control subjects from the Candidate Gene Association Resource Plus Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our results revealed that seven index SNPs at the TCF7L2, KLF14, KCNQ1, ADCY5, CDKAL1, JAZF1, and GCKR loci were significantly associated with T2D (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The strongest association was observed at TCF7L2 rs7903146 (odds ratio [OR] 1.30; P = 6.86 Ã— 10(-8)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Locus-wide analysis demonstrated significant associations (P(emp) &lt; 0.05) at regional best SNPs in the TCF7L2, KLF14, and HMGA2 loci as well as suggestive signals in KCNQ1 after correction for the effective number of SNPs at each locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these loci, the regional best SNPs were in differential linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the index and adjacent SNPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that some loci discovered in prior reports affect T2D susceptibility in AfA with similar effect sizes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The reduced and differential LD pattern in AfA compared with European and Asian populations may facilitate fine mapping of causal variants at loci shared across populations </plain></SENT>
