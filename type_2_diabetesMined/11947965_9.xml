<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the preheparin serum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> lipase mass levels (prehaparin LPL mass) in type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> patients and the effect of insulin therapy on the levels of preheparin LPL mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 40 type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> patients, preheparin LPL mass were measured by the sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and were compared with those of non-diabetic healthy control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The correlation between preheparin LPL mass and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">Hemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c) (HbA(1c)), serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preheparin LPL mass were measured before and after insulin therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Preheparin LPL mass of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> patients was significantly lower than that of non-diabetic healthy control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In diabetic patients, preheparin LPL mass were negatively correlated with HbA(1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients started to take insulin therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Preheparin LPL mass increased significantly at 4th week, when fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that preheparin LPL mass was greatly regulated by insulin action </plain></SENT>
