<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine the association between urodynamic findings and microvascular complications (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>) in patients with long-term type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> but without voiding symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 66 consecutive patients (26 males and 40 females, age 57.00+/-9.50 years, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration 14.44+/-6.78 years) with documented type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, low scores at the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and no subjective complaint of voiding problems were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven urodynamic parameters were considered: detrusor activity, bladder capacity, bladder compliance, first sensation of filling, flow rate, bladder outlet status and post-voiding residue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The following independent associations were found: between female sex and increased bladder capacity (p=0.004), between male sex and both decreased bladder compliance (p=0.023) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005694" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bladder outlet obstruction</z:e> (p=0.001), between old age and both low flow rate (p=0.022) and outlet obstruction (p=0.047), between detrusor instability and shorter duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (p=0.044) and between peripheral somatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> and low flow rate (OR=5.208; 95%CI=1.277-21.277) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Spearman's correlation coefficient for the latter association was 0.356 (p=0.005) and remained significant even after controlling for age, sex, HbA1c and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration (rho=0.310; p=0.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, searching for microvascular complications might be used to screen for some components of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1262037" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic cystopathy</z:e> in its asymptomatic phase </plain></SENT>
