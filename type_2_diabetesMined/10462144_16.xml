<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This increase has been attributed to factors related to lifestyle changes related to modernisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A periurban rural population resembling the rural in their occupation, but with access to certain urban facilities was chosen for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to assess the impact of modernisation on the rising prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the native Indians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 1637 adults aged 20 years and above (749 men and 888 women) were tested for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) by 2 h post-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Demographic, anthropometric, dietary and occupational details, were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Dietary habits were similar in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> categories of socio-economic strata </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the present study group, the age standardised prevalence of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 5.9%, which was intermediate to that in the urban (11.6%) and rural (2.4%) populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prevalence data of the latter two population were available from previous surveys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) was high (6.9%) and similar in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three population samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the periurban population, a large percentage of subjects were doing only routine household work and had a sedentary life-style </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After correcting for the age and BMI, sedentary work and occupation had a significant association with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, suggesting that sedentary lifestyle may be an important determinant for the higher prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in an urbanising population </plain></SENT>
