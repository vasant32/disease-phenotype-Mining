<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the relationship of endothelium-dependent vasodilation and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> has never been prospectively evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study provided the opportunity to assess the association between endothelial vasodilation function and the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a cohort of apparently healthy postmenopausal women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study that began in 1997 with 840 apparently healthy, nonobese, postmenopausal women, aged 53 +/- 6 years, initially with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance at the oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants were followed up for a mean period of 3.9 +/- 0.7 years (range 0.5-6.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endothelial function was measured as flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery, using high-resolution ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no significant differences in demographic, blood pressure, and biochemical profiles among each tertile group at baseline or at follow-up review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, 102 women developed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The adjusted relative risk (RR) for women with FMD &lt;/=4.3 (lowest tertile) was 5.87 (95% CI 4.34-8.10) versus women with FMD &gt;/=5.6 (highest tertile reference) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Each 1-unit decrease of FMD was associated with a significant 32% (22-48%) increase in the multiple-adjusted RR of incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These prospective data indicate a significant increase in the RR of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with each unit decrease of FMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This could suggest that an impaired endothelial function may play a fundamental role in diabetogenesis in postmenopausal women </plain></SENT>
