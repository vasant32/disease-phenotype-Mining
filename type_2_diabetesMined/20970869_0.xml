<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 436 men and 588 women were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>According to levels of GGT and ferritin, they were divided into three groups in each gender of each geological location (Urban or Rural), that is, Group 1 (both GGT and ferritin&lt;median values), Group 2 (only GGT or ferritin ≥ median values), and group 3 (both GGT and ferritin ≥ median values) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios for T2D in group 2-3 compared with group 1 were analyzed by multiple logistic regressions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) The prevalence of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> abnormalities increased across the three groups of female subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Correspondingly, <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> levels were also higher in group 3 than other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(2) GGT and ferritin were correlated with each other after controlling for BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(3) T2D risk was higher in group 3 than that in group 1 in female subjects, which was independent of age, BMI, and T2D family history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: GGT and ferritin were correlated with each other, and had synergetic effect on the risk of T2D in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mechanism might be involved in enhanced <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
