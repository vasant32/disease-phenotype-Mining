<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While amylin reduces food intake in rodents, pramlintide's effect on satiety and food intake in humans has not yet been assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study, 11 insulin-treated men with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (age 60+/-9 years, BMI 28.9+/-4.8 kg/m(2)) and 15 non-diabetic <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> men (age 41+/-21 years, BMI 34.4+/-4.5 kg/m(2)) underwent two standardised meal tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After fasting overnight, subjects received single subcutaneous injections of either pramlintide (120 microg) or placebo, followed by a preload meal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 1 h, subjects ate an ad libitum buffet meal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Energy intake and meal duration were measured, as were hunger ratings (using visual analogue scales), and plasma cholecystokinin, glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> YY concentrations over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with placebo, pramlintide reduced energy intake in both the type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (Delta-202+/-64 kcal, -23+/-8%, p&lt;0.01) and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (Delta-170+/-68 kcal, -16+/-6%, p&lt;0.02) groups, without affecting meal duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hunger and hormonal analyte profiles provided evidence that pramlintide may exert a primary satiogenic effect, independently of other anorexigenic gut <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The results indicate that enhanced satiety and reduced food intake may explain the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> observed in long-term pramlintide trials </plain></SENT>
