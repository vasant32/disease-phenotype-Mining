<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we evaluated the accuracy, safety, and clinical effectiveness of a continuous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-sensing device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 91 insulin-requiring patients with type 1 (n = 75) and type 2 (n = 16) <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were enrolled in this multicenter randomized study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects wore a transcutaneous, 3-day, continuous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-sensing system for three consecutive 72-h periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects were randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to either a control group (continuous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> data not provided) or a display group (continuous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> data not provided during period 1 but displayed during periods 2 and 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During periods 2 and 3, patients in the display group had real-time access to sensor <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> values, could review <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> trends over the preceding 1, 3, and 9 h, and were provided with high (&gt; or = 200 mg/dl) and low (&lt; or = 80 mg/dl) alerts and a low (&lt; or = 55 mg/dl) alarm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sensors were inserted by patients, and both groups used (or wore) the system during daily activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Device accuracy was assessed by comparing continuous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> values to paired self-monitoring of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (SMBG) meter readings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clinical effectiveness was evaluated by analyzing between-group (control vs. display, periods 2 and 3) and within-group (display, period 1 vs. period 3) differences in time spent in high, low, and target (81-140 mg/dl) <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> zones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: When prospective, real-time sensor values were compared with SMBG values, 95.4% of 6,767 paired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> values fell within Clarke error grid A and B zones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pearson's correlation coefficient was 0.88, and mean and median absolute relative differences were 21.2 and 15.9%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No systematic bias was detected at any of the prespecified <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels (50, 80, 100, 150, and 200 mg/dl) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>When compared with control subjects, the display group spent 21% less time as hypoglycemic (&lt;55 mg/dl), 23% less time as hyperglycemic (&gt; or = 240 mg/dl), and 26% more time in the target (81-140 mg/dl) <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> range (P &lt; 0.001 for each comparison) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Nocturnal (10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m.) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>, as assessed at two thresholds, was also reduced by 38% (&lt;55 mg/dl; P &lt; 0.001) and 33% (55-80 mg/dl; P &lt; 0.001) in the display group compared with control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that real-time continuous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring for periods up to 72 h is accurate and safe in insulin-requiring subjects with type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that availability of real-time, continuously measured <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels can significantly improve glycemic excursions by reducing exposure to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> without increasing the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>, which may reduce long-term <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> complications and their associated economic costs </plain></SENT>
