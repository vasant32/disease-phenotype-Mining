<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is poorly understood how the building block of amyloid, islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (IAPP), misfolds and accumulates within the islet to contribute to cellular dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine whether neprilysin, an amyloid-degrading enzyme, is present in islets and plays a role in the accumulation of amyloid fibrils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Human IAPP (hIAPP) transgenic mice, a model of islet amyloid in which primarily male mice develop amyloid by 12 months of age, were studied at 10 weeks and 6 months of age, enabling investigation of islet changes before and during early amyloidogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neprilysin was present in islets, including beta-cells, and islet neprilysin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and activity were found to decline with age in nontransgenic mice as well as in hIAPP transgenic female mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, neprilysin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and activity did not decrease in amyloid-prone hIAPP transgenic male mice at 6 months compared with nontransgenic mice and female hIAPP transgenic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Islet amyloid was detected in 43% of the 6-month-old hIAPP transgenic male mice only, suggesting the sustained elevation of islet neprilysin in these mice was a compensatory mechanism aimed at preventing amyloid accumulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In keeping with amyloid formation, the proportion of insulin-positive area to islet area was significantly reduced in 6-month-old hIAPP transgenic male mice, which also displayed mild fasting <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> compared with age-matched transgenic female and nontransgenic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Together, these findings demonstrate that neprilysin is a factor associated with islet amyloid accumulation and subsequent deterioration of beta-cell function in hIAPP transgenic male mice </plain></SENT>
