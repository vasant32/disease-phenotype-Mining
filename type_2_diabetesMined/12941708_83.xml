<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">Thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> (TZDs), a class of insulin-sensitizing agents used clinically to treat type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, are also antiatherogenic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to elucidate the relationship between the antiatherogenic and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>, a TZD, in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 136 Japanese type 2 diabetic patients were included and divided into two groups: the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>-treated group (30 mg daily for 3 months) (n = 70) and the untreated control group (n = 66) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The changes in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipid</z:chebi> metabolism as well as plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP), leptin, adiponectin, and pulse wave velocity (PWV) were monitored to analyze the relationship between the antiatherogenic and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> treatment significantly reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo>, and HbA(1c) levels and increased plasma adiponectin concentrations relative to the control group (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It also significantly decreased CRP and PWV (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The antiatherogenic effect was observed in both the nonresponders showing &lt;1% of reduction in HbA(1c) (n = 30) and responders showing &gt;1% of reduction (n = 40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ANCOVA revealed that treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> was associated with a low CRP and PWV, independent of the changes in parameters related to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study represents the first demonstration of the antiatherogenic effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> in both nonresponders and responders with respect to its <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> effect and suggests that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> can exert its antiatherogenic effect independently of its <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> effect </plain></SENT>
