<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this study, 26 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> consumed a HP (28% protein, 42% carbohydrate) or LP diet (16% protein, 55% carbohydrate) during 8 weeks of energy restriction (1,600 kcal/day) and 4 weeks of energy balance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Body weight and composition and REE were measured, and the TEF in response to a HP or LP meal was determined for 2 h, at weeks 0 and 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> was 4.6 +/- 0.4 kg (P &lt; 0.001), of which 4.5 +/- 0.4 kg was fat (P &lt; 0.001), with no effect of diet (P = 0.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At both weeks 0 and 12, TEF was greater after the HP than after the LP meal (0.064 vs. 0.050 kcal x kcal(-1) energy consumed x 2 h(-1), respectively; overall diet effect, P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>REE and TEF were reduced similarly with each of the diets (time effects, P = 0.02 and P &lt; 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, a low-fat diet with an increased protein-to-carbohydrate ratio does not significantly increase <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> or blunt the fall in REE </plain></SENT>
