<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Dietary intakes of zinc and other nutrients were assessed and updated using a validated food frequency questionnaire from 1980 to 2002 among 82,297 women who were aged 33-60 years at baseline in 1980 and followed up to 2004 in the Nurses' Health Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the 24 years of follow-up, 6,030 incident cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were ascertained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After adjustment of lifestyle and dietary risk factors, the relative risks (RRs) (95% CI) of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> comparing the highest with the lowest quintiles were 0.90 (0.82-0.99) (P(trend) = 0.04) for total zinc intake and 0.92 (0.84-1.00) (P(trend) = 0.009) for dietary zinc intake from food sources, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We further found an inverse association for dietary zinc to <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> iron ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After multivariate adjustment of covariates, the RRs (95% CI) across quintiles of this ratio were 1.0 (reference), 0.93 (0.86-1.01), 0.86 (0.79-0.94), 0.82 (0.75-0.90), and 0.72 (0.66-0.80), respectively (P(trend) &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Higher zinc intake may be associated with a slightly lower risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>More studies are warranted to confirm this association and to explore potential mechanisms </plain></SENT>
