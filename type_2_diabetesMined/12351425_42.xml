<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Defects in liver and muscle <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthesis are major factors contributing to postprandrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, activation of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase through inhibition of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase kinase (GSK)-3 represents a potential new therapeutic target </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To examine this possibility, we performed oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests (OGTTs) and euglycemic-insulinemic clamp studies in <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> diabetic fatty (fa/fa) rats before and after treatment with novel GSK-3 inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>GSK-3 inhibition caused a 41 +/- 2% (P &lt; 0.001) and 26 +/- 4% (P &lt; 0.05) reduction in the area under the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin concentration curves, respectively, during the OGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This improvement in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal could mostly be attributed to an approximate twofold increase in liver <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, there was no significant increase in muscle <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthesis despite an approximate threefold activation of muscle <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>GSK-3 inhibitor treatment increased liver <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthesis about threefold independent of insulin concentration during the clamp studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, muscle <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake and muscle <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthesis were independent of drug treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>GSK-3 inhibitor treatment lowered fasting <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> in diabetic rats by 6.0 +/- 1.3 mmol/l but had no significant effect on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal during the clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, GSK-3 inhibition significantly improved oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal, mostly by increasing liver <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These studies suggest that GSK-3 inhibition may represent an important new therapeutic target for treatment of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
