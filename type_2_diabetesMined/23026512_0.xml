<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: We genotyped PSMA6 gene -8 C/G polymorphism in the control groups and T2DM groups in two populations from China using PCR-RFLP technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Phenotypes and biochemical indicators were measured by biochemical technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULT: The frequencies of CG+GG genotype were observably different from CC genotype in the T2DM groups and control groups (for Dongxiang population: OR = 1.341, 95% CI: 1.101-1.632, P = 0.004; for Han population: OR = 1.313, 95% CI: 1.085-1.569, P = 0.006 after adjusting for gender, age, and BMI, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the Dongxiang population, the FPG, HOMA-IR, SBP and TG levels of CG+GG genotype were markedly higher than those of the CC genotype in control group (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, in the Han population, we only found that the FPI level of the CC genotype was significantly higher than that of the CG+GG genotype in control group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our investigation suggests that -8 C/G variant of PSMA6 gene may be associated with T2DM and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related metabolic traits in Chinese Dongxiang and Han populations </plain></SENT>
