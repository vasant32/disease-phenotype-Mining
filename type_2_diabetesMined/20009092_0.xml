<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Thoracoabdominal calcifications of native radiograms were evaluated in 833 subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 1,292 subjects without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, aged 45-64 years, without prior evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The type 2 diabetic and nondiabetic study cohorts were followed up for 18 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS After adjustment for conventional risk factors, marked thoracoabdominal calcifications predicted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>/total mortality with hazard ratio (HR) (95% CI) of 1.5 (0.8-3.0)/1.8 (1.1-2.9) in type 2 diabetic men, 3.0 (1.6-5.7)/3.1 (1.9-5.0) in type 2 diabetic women, 5.0 (2.2-12)/4.0 (2.2-7.4) in nondiabetic men, and 7.8 (1.8-34)/3.0 (1.3-7.0) in nondiabetic women and in the presence of C-reactive protein below/over 3 mg/l with HR of 2.4 (1.3-4.4)/3.0 (1.4-6.1) in type 2 diabetic subjects and 4.0 (1.5-10.8)/6.6 (2.7-16.0) in nondiabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS Thoracoabdominal calcifications in native radiograms are significant predictors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> and total mortality, especially in type 2 diabetic and nondiabetic women with elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level </plain></SENT>
