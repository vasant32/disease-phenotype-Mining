<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been prospectively investigated in a series of multinational, randomised, controlled phase 3 trials (the Liraglutide Effect and Action in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> programme), as well as in an additional direct head-to-head study with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These trials were designed to clarify the use and safety of liraglutide in clinical practice across the treatment continuum of T2D, and consequently involved a large number and diverse range of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These studies also included active comparisons against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> agents including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi>, insulin glargine, exenatide and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi>, and therefore have helped to examine clinical differences and similarities between liraglutide and these commonly used agents </plain></SENT>
