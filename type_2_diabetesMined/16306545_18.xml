<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and its complications and comorbidities were derived from population-based epidemiologic studies and randomized, controlled clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Health utility scores were derived for patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> using the Quality of Well Being-Self-Administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Direct medical costs were derived for managed care patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> using paid insurance claims </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Monte Carlo techniques were used to implement a semi-Markov model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Performance of the model was assessed using baseline and 4- and 10-year follow-up data from the older-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> diabetic population studied in the Wisconsin Epidemiologic Study of Diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>Retinopathy</z:hpo> (WESDR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Applying the model to the baseline WESDR population with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we predicted mortality to be 51% at 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> were predicted to be 18 and 19% at 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prevalences of nonproliferative diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, proliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, and macular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> were predicted to be 45, 16, and 18%, respectively; the prevalences of <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal disease</z:hpo> were predicted to be 19, 39, and 3%, respectively; and the prevalences of clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath> were predicted to be 52 and 5%, respectively, at 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Over 10 years, average undiscounted total direct medical costs were estimated to be USD $53,000 per person </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among survivors, the average utility score was estimated to be 0.56 at 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our computer simulation model accurately predicted survival and the cardiovascular, microvascular, and neuropathic complications observed in the WESDR cohort with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> over 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The model can be used to predict the progression of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and its complications, comorbidities, quality of life, and cost and to assess the relative effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and cost-utility of alternative strategies for the prevention and treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
