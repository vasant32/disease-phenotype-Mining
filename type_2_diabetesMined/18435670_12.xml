<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Combination use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and a sulphonylurea has become increasingly common; yet, the impact of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> on quality of life in these patients is not well documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine patient-reported experience of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e>, worry about hypoglycaemic symptoms and the impact of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> on patients' quality of life associated with use of sulphonylurea co-administered with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: This was an observational, cross-sectional, multi-centre study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: A total of 98 primary care centres in France during October to December 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: A total of 400 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, who were &gt; or = 35 years old and who had been treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and a sulphonylurea for at least 6 months, completed questionnaires during their usual primary care office visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Frequency and severity of hypoglycaemic symptoms in the past 6 months, the Worry subscale of the Hypoglycaemic Fear Survey-II (HFS-II) and the EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 136 (34%) patients reported experiencing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e>, of whom 78 (58%) experienced mild, 40 (30%) experienced moderate and 16 (12%) experienced severe or very severe symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean score on the HFS-II Worry scale was higher for patients who reported having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> than for those who did not (19.0 vs. 10.2; p &lt; 0.0001) and increased with severity of hypoglycaemic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In linear regression analyses, more severe symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> were significantly associated with higher scores on the HFS-II Worry scale (p = 0.0162) among patients with hypoglycaemic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Summary scores on the EQ-5D were lower for patients who reported <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> than for those who did not (p = 0.0001) and, in multivariate analysis, the experience of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> was negatively associated with the EQ-5D summary score (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The occurrence and severity of hypoglycaemic symptoms were associated with increased patient worry about <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> and lower health-related quality of life among type 2 diabetic patients being treated with both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and a sulphonylurea </plain></SENT>
