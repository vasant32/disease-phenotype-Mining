<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Insulin detemir was to be started once-daily as add-on therapy to any other <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering regimens or as a replacement of prestudy basal insulin in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Investigator sites rather than individual patients were randomized to either the 303 Algorithm group or the Standard-of-care group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients from the 303 Algorithm group sites were instructed to adjust their insulin detemir dose every 3 days based on the mean of three 'adjusted' fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (aFPG) values (capillary blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> calibrated to equivalent plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> values) using a simple algorithm: mean aFPG &lt; 80 mg/dl (&lt;4.4 mmol/l), reduce dose by 3 U; aFPG between 80 and 110 mg/dl (4.4-6.1 mmol/l), no change; and aFPG &gt; 110 mg/dl (&gt;1.1 mmol/l), increase dose by 3 U </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The insulin detemir dose for patients in the Standard-of-care group was adjusted by the investigator according to the standard of care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean A1C decreased from 8.5% at baseline to 7.9% at 26 weeks for the 303 Algorithm group and from 8.5 to 8.0% for the Standard-of-care group (p = 0.0106 for difference in A1C reduction between the two groups) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean FPG values decreased from 175 mg/dl (9.7 mmol/l) at baseline to 141 mg/dl (7.8 mmol/l) for the 303 Algorithm group and decreased from 174 mg/dl (9.7 mmol/l) to 152 mg/dl (8.4 mmol/l) for the Standard-of-care group (p &lt; 0.0001 for difference in FPG reduction between the two groups) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean body weight remained the same at 26 weeks in both groups (change from baseline 0.1 and -0.2 kg for the 303 Algorithm group and the Standard-of-care group respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 26 weeks, 91% of the patients in the 303 Algorithm group and 85% of the patients in the Standard-of-care group remained on once-daily insulin detemir administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The rates of overall <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> (events/patient/year) decreased significantly from baseline in both groups [from 9.05 to 6.44 for the 303 Algorithm group (p = 0.0039) and from 9.53 to 4.95 for the Standard-of-care group (p &lt; 0.0001)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Major hypoglycaemic events were rare in both groups (0.26 events/patient/year for the 303 Algorithm group and 0.20 events/patient/year for the Standard-of-care group; p = 0.2395) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, patients in the 303 Algorithm group achieved comparable glycaemic control with higher rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> as compared with patients in the Standard-of-care group, possibly because of more aggressive insulin dose adjustments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The vast majority of the patients in both groups were effectively treated with once-daily insulin detemir therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The use of insulin detemir in this predominantly primary care setting achieved significant improvements in glycaemic control with minimal risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> and no <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
