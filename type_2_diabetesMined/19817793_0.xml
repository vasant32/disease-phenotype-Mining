<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Islets from rodent control and animal models of type 1 and type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and healthy humans and insulin- and glucagon-producing cell lines have been used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Protein profiling entails separation, differential expression determination, identification and expression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Protein/<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> separation is either gel-based or by chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Differential expression is based on comparison of visualized spots/proteins between gels or by sample labelling in gel-free systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Identification of proteins is made by tryptic fragmentation of proteins, fragment mass determination and mass comparison with protein databases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of expression data sets interprets the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="33837">complex protein</z:chebi> changes into cellular mechanisms to generate hypotheses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The importance of such protein expression sets to elucidate islet cellular events is evidenced by the observation that only about 50% of the differentially expressed proteins and transcripts showed concordance when measured in parallel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using protein profiling, different areas related to islet dysfunction in type 1 and type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> have been addressed, including dysfunction induced by elevated levels of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and fatty acids and cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because islets from individuals with type 1 or type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> have not yet been protein profiled, islets from rat (BB-DP) and mouse (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOD</z:e>, ob/ob, MKR) models of the disease have been used, and mechanisms responsible for islet dysfunction delineated offering avenues of intervention </plain></SENT>
