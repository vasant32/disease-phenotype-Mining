<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AC2993 also promotes beta-cell proliferation and neogenesis in vitro and in animal models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examines the activity and safety of subcutaneously injected AC2993 in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> currently treated with diet and/or oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> agents (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="30744">OAAs</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 109 patients treated with diet and a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> and/or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> were enrolled in a blinded study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomly assigned to one of three subcutaneously (SC) injected regimens of AC2993 (0.08 micro g/kg) or placebo for 28 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three AC2993 regimens led to significant reductions in serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24103">fructosamine</z:chebi> relative to placebo (P &lt;or= 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean reductions ranged from 39 to 46 micro mol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> AC2993 groups had reductions in HbA(1c) ranging from 0.7 to 1.1% (P &lt;or= 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An end-of-study HbA(1c) &lt;7% was achieved by 15% of AC2993 patients versus 4% of placebo patients, confirming AC2993 effects on fasting and postprandial glycemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On days 14 and 28, the beta-cell index (homeostasis model assessment) for patients treated with AC2993 was 50-100% higher than baseline, contrasting with unchanged levels for placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The most common adverse event was transient mild-to-moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: AC2993 is a promising therapeutic for patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In this study, it had significant effects on HbA(1c) levels in patients not currently achieving optimal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control with diet and/or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="30744">OAAs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
