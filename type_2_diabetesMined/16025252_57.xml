<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, fluid retention might lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> in a minority of people </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: RECORD is a 6-year, randomised, open-label study in type 2 diabetic patients with inadequate blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control (HbA1c 7.1-9.0%) on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> or sulphonylurea alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study is being performed in 327 centres in Europe and Australasia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After a 4-week run-in, participants were randomised by current treatment stratum to add-on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> or sulphonylurea, with dose titration to a target HbA1c of &lt; or = 7.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>If confirmed HbA1c rises to &gt; or = 8.5%, either a third <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering drug is added (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>-treated group) or insulin is started (non-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The same criterion for failure of triple oral drug therapy in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>-treated group is used for starting insulin in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint is the time to first CV hospitalisation or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, blindly adjudicated by a central endpoints committee </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The study aim is to evaluate non-inferiority of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> group vs the non-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> group with respect to CV outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Safety, tolerability and study conduct are monitored by an independent board </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> CV endpoint and safety data are held and analysed by a clinical trials organisation, and are not available to the study investigators while data collection is open </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over a 2-year period a total of 7,428 people were screened in 25 countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Of these, 4,458 were randomised; 2,228 on background <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, 2,230 on background sulphonylurea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Approximately half of the participants are male (52%) and almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> are Caucasian (99%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The RECORD study should provide robust data on the extent to which <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>, in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> or sulphonylurea therapy, affects CV outcomes and progression of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the long term </plain></SENT>
