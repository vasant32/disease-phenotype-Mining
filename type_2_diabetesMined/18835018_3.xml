<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that type 1 (T1D) and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2D) might share some susceptibility risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A higher prevalence of T2D has been reported in families of Caucasian T1D children than in the general population, although data in adults and multiethnic groups is still lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our goal was to compare the prevalence of T2D family history between adults with T1D from a multiethnic population and a non-diabetic control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed a cross-sectional analysis of 145 adults with T1D and 141 healthy adults (control group) that included an interview and a review of the medical charts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Groups were matched for age, sex, ethnicity and body mass index (BMI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found a higher prevalence of not only T1D but also T2D in first-degree relatives of patients than in controls (p&lt;0.001 and p=0.042, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These differences were not observed for second/third-degree relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When subjects were stratified according to their ethnicity, the higher frequency of T2D in FDR of patients than controls became more striking in non-white (p=0.002) and disappeared in white individuals (p=0.85) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To conclude, the prevalence of T1D and T2D was higher in first-degree relatives of patients with T1D than of controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The difference in T2D family history between patients and controls was specially striking among non-whites, which may represent a peculiarity of T1D in this group </plain></SENT>
