<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Experimental studies in laboratory animals suggest that nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) might be involved in the pathogenesis of glomerular hyperfiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a cross-sectional study to determine the relationship between diabetic glomerular hyperfiltration and the NO system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Normoalbuminuric (n=41), microalbuminuric (n=25), and macroalbuminuric (n=16) patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were recruited in this study and compared with age-matched 84 non-diabetic control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">Creatinine</z:chebi> clearance and urinary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29272">NO(2)</z:chebi>(-)/NO(3)(-) excretion (urinary NOx) were measured, and the expression of endothelial cell nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (ecNOS) was evaluated in human renal tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Glomerular hyperfiltration was present in 19 (37.5%) and nine (36.6%) of normoalbuminuric and microalbuminuric type 2 diabetic patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The urinary NOx was significantly higher in normoalbuminuric patients compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">Creatinine</z:chebi> clearance correlated significantly with urinary NOx in normoalbuminuric and microalbuminuric patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining intensities for ecNOS were significantly increased in glomerular endothelial cells of microalbuminuric type 2 diabetic patients as compared with the control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that NO may contribute to the pathogenesis of glomerular hyperfiltration in Japanese type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
