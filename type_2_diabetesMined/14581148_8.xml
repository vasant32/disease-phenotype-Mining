<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a nationwide case register study, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who had a discharge diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002758'>osteoarthritis</z:hpo> at first admission in a period from 1977 to 1997 were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The probability of being readmitted and discharged with a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> was estimated with competing risks models in survival analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In total, 91,507 patients with a diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at first discharge and 108,487 patients with a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002758'>osteoarthritis</z:hpo> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median age of the populations was high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No difference in the risk of being readmitted with a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> was found between the two groups of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the risk for Type 1 and Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that older patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> do not seem to have an increased risk of developing severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> compared with patients with other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> illness </plain></SENT>
