<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare the hospitalizations of people with type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with those of the nondiabetic population of Tayside, Scotland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study set in Tayside, Scotland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Study subjects were eligible for inclusion if they lived in Tayside from 1 January 1995 to 31 December 1995 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparisons between people with and without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were assessed using logistic regression modeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The fixed population for the year 1995 included 366,849 people registered with a Tayside general practitioner; 7,735 (2.1%) of these had <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Approximately 25% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> study subjects with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had at least one hospital admission, compared with 12% of the nondiabetic population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The length of stay was highest for patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (median of 7 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>People with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> accounted for 8.2% of the total bed days and had approximately double the risk of admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Type 2 diabetic patients had increased risks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>; both type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients were at increased risk for an <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi>/metabolic admission or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The risk of ophthalmic admissions, especially for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo>, was much higher in patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with the nondiabetic population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was associated with more frequent and longer admissions compared with the nondiabetic population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This was due to a higher risk of neurological, cardiovascular, renal, and ophthalmic hospitalizations compared with people without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
