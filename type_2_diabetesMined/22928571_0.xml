<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The potential benefits and limitations of this approach continue to be intensively debated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To contribute to the understanding of experimental pharmacology and therapeutics of GKAs, we have tested the efficacy of one of these agents (Piragliatin) in isolated islets from humans with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM), from mice with glucokinase (GK) mutations induced by ethyl-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35801">nitroso</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="23995">ENU</z:chebi>) as models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004904'>Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young</z:hpo> linked to GK and Permanent Neonatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>Diabetes Mellitus</z:hpo> linked to GK (PNDM-GK) and finally of islets rendered <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> insensitive by treatment with the sulphonyl <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> compound <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi> in organ culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that the GKA repaired the defect in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three instances as manifest in increased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced insulin release and elevated intracellular calcium responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results show the remarkable fact that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> pharmacological activation of GK reverses secretion defects of β-cells caused by molecular mechanism that differ vastly in nature, including the little understood multifactorial lesion of β-cells in T2DM of man, the complex GK mutations in mice resembling GK disease and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> sulphonylurea failure of mouse β-cells in tissue culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The implications of these results are to be discussed on the theoretical basis underpinning the strategy of developing these drugs and in light of recent results of clinical trials with GKAs that failed for little understood reasons </plain></SENT>
