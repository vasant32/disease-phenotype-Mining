<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Many studies have documented associations between <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed potential variability in this association in the major U.S. racial/ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was assessed among men and women aged 45-84 years without prior clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> or <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the prospective Multi-Ethnic Study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interleukin (IL)-6, fibrinogen, and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured at baseline (2000-2002); fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> medication use was assessed at baseline and three subsequent in-person exams through 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was defined as use of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> drugs or <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &gt; or =126 mg/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Covariates included baseline demographics, clinic, smoking, alcohol, exercise, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> medication, systolic blood pressure, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, and BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) by quartiles of CRP, IL-6, and fibrinogen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 5,571 participants (mean age 61.6 years, 53% female, 42.1% white, 11.5% Chinese, 25.7% black, and 20.7% Hispanic), 410 developed incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during a median follow-up time of 4.7 years (incidence 16.8 per 1,000 person-years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CRP, IL-6, and fibrinogen levels were associated with incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the entire sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After adjustment, the associations were attenuated; however, quartile 4 (versus quartile 1) of IL-6 (HR 1.5 [95% CI 1.1-2.2]) and CRP (1.7 [1.3-2.4]) remained associated with incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In stratified analyses, similar associations were observed among white, black, and Hispanic participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Higher levels of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> predict short-term incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a multiethnic American sample </plain></SENT>
