<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We studied <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> changes in markers of glycoxidative and lipoxidative stress, including oxidized <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>, N(epsilon)-(carboxyethyl)-lysine (CEL), N(epsilon)-(carboxymethyl)-lysine (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>), and 3-deoxyglucosone (3DG), following two consecutive meals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Postmenopausal women (27 with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism [NGM], 26 with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) received two consecutive fat-rich meals and two consecutive carbohydrate-rich meals on two occasions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> concentrations were measured at baseline and 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 h following breakfast; lunch was given at 4 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Oxidized <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-to-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> ratio, CEL, <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>, and 3DG were measured at baseline and at 8 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fasting oxidized <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-to-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> ratio, 3DG, and <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> were higher in women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with women with NGM and were comparable to the postprandial values at 8 h in NGM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postprandial rises in the oxidized <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-to-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> ratio and 3DG were similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the oxidized <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-to-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> ratio increased more after the fat-rich meals, whereas <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> and 3DG increased more after the carbohydrate-rich meals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After the fat-rich meals, the increase in the oxidized <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-to-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> ratio correlated with postprandial <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, whereas the increase in 3DG was correlated with postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> changes in markers of glycoxidative and lipoxidative stress in both type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and NGM suggest that postabsorptive <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> may partly underlie the association of postprandial derangements and cardiovascular risk </plain></SENT>
