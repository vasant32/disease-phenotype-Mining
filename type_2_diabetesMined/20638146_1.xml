<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical appearance of Candida-associated denture <z:hpo ids='HP_0010280'>stomatitis</z:hpo> (DS) in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relationships between the types of DS, oral complaints and associated conditions were assessed in terms of glycemic control as determined by glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA1c) measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Demographic and clinical data were obtained from questionnaires and oral examinations of 110 edentulous patients with T2DM and 50 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Type II DS commonly occurred in diabetics (57.3% vs 30%; p=0.002) together with DS related oral complaints (60.9% vs 24%; p&lt;0.001) compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Burning sensation of the mouth (BS) was the most common complaint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dryness of the oral mucosa (DOM) (50.9% vs 6%; p&lt;0.001), angular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100825'>cheilitis</z:hpo> (26.4% vs 8%; p=0.01) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000206'>glossitis</z:hpo> (27.3% vs 6%; p=0.003) occurred more frequently in diabetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Oral complaints and associated conditions of DS coincided with elevated HbA1c levels (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Diabetics with extensive type of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> had higher HbA1c levels than type I/III DS subjects (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Diffuse type of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> was associated with T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>BS and DOM were the most common oral complaints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Inadequately controlled <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with Candida-associated DS was linked to a high incidence of an extensive type of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, oral complaints and associated conditions </plain></SENT>
