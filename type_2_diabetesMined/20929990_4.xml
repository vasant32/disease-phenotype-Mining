<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The hypothesis was that combined correction of major pathogenetic defects in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> would result in optimal glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This study was a 2-year investigator-driven randomized partly placebo-controlled multicenter trial in 371 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on at least oral antiglycemic treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were assigned to one of eight treatment groups in a factorial design with insulin aspart at mealtimes versus <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin once daily at bedtime, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> twice daily versus placebo, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> twice daily versus placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The main outcome measurement was change in A1C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A1C decreased more in patients treated with insulin aspart compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> (-0.41 ± 0.10%, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> decreased A1C compared with placebo (-0.60 ± 0.10%, P &lt; 0.001), as did <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> (-0.55 ± 0.10%, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Triple therapy (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, and any insulin) resulted in a greater reduction in A1C than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> plus insulin (-0.50 ± 0.14%, P &lt; 0.001) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> plus insulin (-0.45 ± 0.14%, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Aspart was associated with a higher increase in body weight (1.6 ± 0.6 kg, P &lt; 0.01) and higher incidence of mild daytime <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> (4.9 ± 7.5 vs. 1.7 ± 5.4 number/person/year, P &lt; 0.001) compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Insulin treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011998'>postprandial hyperglycemia</z:hpo> results in lower A1C than treatment of fasting <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, at the expense of higher body weight and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001988'>hypoglycemic episodes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, insulin therapy has to be combined with treatment of both peripheral and liver <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> to normalize blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and in this case, the insulin regimen is less important </plain></SENT>
