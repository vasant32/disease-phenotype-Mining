<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients received 4 weeks of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi> followed by 4 weeks of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi> plus hydrochlorothiazide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a double-blind randomised fashion, patients received <z:chebi fb="40" ids="26710">sodium chloride</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi>, 100 mmol/24 h) or placebo capsules in addition to their habitual salt intake during the last 2 weeks of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi> plus hydrochlorothiazide therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The protocol was repeated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> and placebo capsules administered in reverse order to allow each participant to act as his or her own control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 0, 4, 8, 14, 18 and 22 weeks, 24 h ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) and 24 h urine collections were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were seen in the ABP response in the LDS vs HDS groups to any of the interventions (p = 0.58) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> supplementation reduced the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi> with or without hydrochlorothiazide on systolic BP by approximately 50% (-5.8 mmHg during <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> supplementation vs -11.3 mmHg during placebo, mean difference 5.6 mmHg [95% CI 1.7-9.4 mmHg], p = 0.005), irrespective of habitual salt intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By contrast, addition of hydrochlorothiazide increased the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi> on systolic BP by approximately 35% (p = 0.048) in both groups of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> supplementation blunts the effectiveness of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi> with or without hydrochlorothiazide in hypertensive patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, independently of habitual low or high salt intake </plain></SENT>
