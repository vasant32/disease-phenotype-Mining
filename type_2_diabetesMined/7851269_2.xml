<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have measured glomerular filtration rate using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50076">51Cr</z:chebi> EDTA clearance in 15 young Polynesians (mean age 32 years), 1-30 months after the initial diagnosis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 15 control Polynesian subjects of comparable age and sex distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean glomerular filtration rate in the diabetic subjects (216 ml/min) was 57% greater than that of the controls (137.5 ml/min, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>About one-third of their excess in glomerular filtration rate could be accounted for by the marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> of the diabetic subjects, but even after correcting for body size the diabetic subjects still had a significantly higher mean glomerular filtration rate than controls (165.6 vs. 119.6 ml/min per 1.73 m2, P &lt; 0.001); 73% of the diabetic subjects had hyperfiltration (&gt; 140 ml/min per 1.73 m2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diabetic subjects were normotensive but nonetheless had increased rates of albumin excretion (median 61 versus 9 mg/day, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that hyperfiltration is common in young Polynesians with recently diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prospective studies are needed to determine whether this early abnormality of renal function heralds the later development of overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
