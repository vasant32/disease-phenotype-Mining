<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> 1 (GLP-1) is a gut-brain hormone that regulates food intake, energy metabolism, and cardiovascular functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the brain, through a currently unknown molecular mechanism, it simultaneously reduces femoral artery blood flow and muscle <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By analogy to pancreatic β-cells where GLP-1 activates protein kinase C (PKC) to stimulate insulin secretion, we postulated that PKC enzymes would be molecular targets of brain GLP-1 signaling that regulate metabolic and vascular function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used both genetic and pharmacological approaches to investigate the role of PKC isoforms in brain GLP-1 signaling in the conscious, free-moving mouse simultaneous with metabolic and vascular measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) mouse brain, the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> exendin-4 selectively promotes translocation of PKC-δ (but not -βII, -α, or -ε) to the plasma membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This translocation is blocked in Glp1r(-/-) mice and in WT mice infused in the brain with exendin-9, an <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> of the GLP-1R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This mechanism coordinates both blood flow in the femoral artery and whole-body insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Consequently, in hyperglycemic, high-fat diet-fed diabetic mice, hypothalamic PKC-δ activity was increased and its pharmacological inhibition improved both insulin-sensitive metabolic and vascular phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our studies show that brain GLP-1 signaling activates hypothalamic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent PKC-δ to regulate femoral artery blood flow and insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This mechanism is attenuated during the development of experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> and may contribute to the pathophysiology of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
