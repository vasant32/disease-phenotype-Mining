<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The stimulatory effect of the glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (GLP)-1(7-36) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29337,32988">amide</z:chebi> on electrical activity in pancreatic b-cells recorded in vivo was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The injection of GLP-1 produces a lengthening of the active phase with respect to the silent phase, leading to a stimulation of insulin release, which produces a secondary decrease in blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration and eventually, to the hyperpolarization of the membrane at a blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level of approximately 5 mmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The injection of GLP-1 at a glycemic level &lt;5 mmol/l does not stimulate electrical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This is in contrast to the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27999">tolbutamide</z:chebi>, which stimulates electrical activity at low <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that in vivo, the stimulatory effect of GLP-1 on insulin secretion is at least partially mediated by its effect on beta-cell electrical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> dependence of the effect confers to GLP-1, a security factor that supports its potential use in the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
