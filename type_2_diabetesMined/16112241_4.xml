<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study examined the long-term glycaemic control and safety of insulin glargine (LANTUS) in patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This &lt;or=28-month, long-term extension of a multinational, multicentre, open-label 52-week study enrolled patients from the original study to continue taking insulin glargine at bedtime plus previous oral hypoglycaemic agents (OHAs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Efficacy and safety were assessed by HbA(1c) and adverse events, symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> and selected clinical and laboratory variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two hundred and thirty-nine treated patients from the original study entered the extension study and 198 completed the extension study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a 1.02% reduction in mean HbA(1c) from baseline of the original study (9.44%) to endpoint of the extension study (8.42%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No new or unexpected adverse events were observed with longer term exposure to insulin glargine over a treatment period of&lt;or=39 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported for 152 patients (63.6%), four of which (1.7%) were considered to be possibly treatment-related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> observed during the original study was +2.12 kg with an absence of further <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> at the end of the extension study (+2.02 kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Long-term insulin glargine treatment plus OHAs provides continued glycaemic control and is well tolerated in patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, insulin glargine appears to be suitable for the long-term management of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
