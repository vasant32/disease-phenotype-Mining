<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Treatment algorithms for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> call for intensification of therapy over time as the disease progresses and glycaemic control worsens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>If diet, exercise and oral antihyperglycaemic medications (OAMs) fail to maintain glycaemic control then basal insulin is added and ultimately prandial insulin may be required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, such an intensification strategy carries risk of increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>, both of which are associated with worse long-term outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An alternative strategy is to intensify therapy by the addition of a short-acting glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> (GLP-1 RA) rather than prandial insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Short-acting GLP-1 RAs such as exenatide twice daily are particularly effective at reducing postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> while basal insulin has a greater effect on fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, providing a physiological rationale for this complementary approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This review analyzes the latest randomized controlled clinical trials of insulin/GLP-1 RA combination therapy and examines results from 'real-world' use of the combinations as reported through observational and clinical practice studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most common finding across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of studies was that combination therapy improved glycaemic control without <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> or an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Many studies reported <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and a reduction in insulin use when a GLP-1 RA was added to existing insulin therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, the relative degree of benefit to glycaemic control and weight was influenced by the insulin titration employed in conjunction with the GLP-1 RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The greatest glycaemic benefits were observed in studies with structured titration of insulin to glycaemic targets while the greatest weight benefits were observed in studies with a protocol-specified focus on insulin sparing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The adverse event profile of GLP-1 RAs in the reviewed trials was similar to that reported with GLP-1 RAs as monotherapy or in combination with OAMs with gastrointestinal events being the most commonly reported </plain></SENT>
