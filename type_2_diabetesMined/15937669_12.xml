<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, genetic variation of PPARGC1A could be implicated in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined whether the PPARGC1A gene locus is associated with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also investigated its association with clinical and metabolic parameters in healthy and diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: After sequencing exons and their boundaries of the PPARGC1A gene, including the promoter region ( approximately 1.5 kb), we genotyped eight common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in an association study comprising 762 unrelated patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 303 non-diabetic control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We divided the patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> into quartiles or three groups according to age at diagnosis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>: &lt;40 years of age, average-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>: 40&lt; or = &lt;60 years, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo>: &gt; or =60 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no strong association between SNPs or haplotypes of PPARGC1A and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the SNPs of g.-1789G&gt;A and g.-1437C&gt;T were associated with the age at diagnosis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (p=0.042 and p=0.032, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, the promoter SNPs of g.-1789G&gt;A and g.-1437C&gt;T and the haplotypes ht2 (-1789A and -1437T) were significantly associated with early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (p=0.002, p=0.001 and p=0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that PPARGC1A promoter polymorphisms are associated with age at diagnosis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the Korean population </plain></SENT>
