<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This cross-sectional study was performed to clarify how serum FGF21 levels were associated with clinical parameters in Japanese subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n=139) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anthropometric and blood biochemical parameters, uses of drugs for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> were examined regarding associations with fasting serum FGF21 concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FGF21 levels were 6-times higher in those subjects taking fibrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, a use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> did not affect serum FGF21 levels while it induced higher serum adiponectin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In univariate analyses, FGF21 levels showed associations with a use of fibrates, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> levels, waist circumference, and BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multiple regression analyses adjusted for age, gender and BMI showed that a use of fibrates, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> levels were strong contributors to serum FGF21 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, a use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> levels and fasting insulin levels were strong contributors to serum adiponectin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study revealed that serum FGF21 levels were biochemical indicators correlating to a set of essential metabolic parameters, which was distinct from that correlating to serum adiponectin levels in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
