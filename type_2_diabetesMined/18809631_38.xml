<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study included 329 patients with poorly controlled <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> randomized to once-daily treatment with 12.5 mg alogliptin (n = 133), 25 mg alogliptin (n = 131), or placebo (n = 65) for 26 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Primary efficacy end point was mean change from baseline in A1C at the final visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At week 26, mean change in A1C was significantly greater (P &lt; 0.001) for 12.5 mg (-0.56%) and 25 mg (-0.59%) alogliptin than placebo (-0.02%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reductions in fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> were also greater (P &lt; 0.001) in alogliptin-treated patients than in those receiving placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, incidences of adverse events (67.4-70.3%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> (1.5-3.0%) were similar across treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Alogliptin monotherapy was well tolerated and significantly improved glycemic control in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, without raising the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
