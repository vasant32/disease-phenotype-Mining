<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In the Dutch prospective Doetinchem Cohort Study, cognitive functioning was measured twice within a 5-year time interval in 2,613 men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants were aged 43-70 years at baseline (1995-2002), and no one had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Change in scores on global cognitive function as well as on specific cognitive function domains (memory, speed of cognitive processes, and cognitive flexibility) were compared for respondents with and without type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (verified by the general practitioner or random plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels &gt;or=11.1 mmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At the 5-year follow-up, the decline in global cognitive function in diabetic patients was 2.6 times greater than that in individuals without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For individuals aged &gt;or=60 years, patients with incident and prevalent <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> showed a 2.5 and 3.6 times greater decline, respectively, in cognitive flexibility than individuals without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For most cognitive domains, the magnitude of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> in patients with incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was intermediate between that of individuals without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and that of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Middle-aged individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> showed a greater decline in cognitive function than middle-aged individuals without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
