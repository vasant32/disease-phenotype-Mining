<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a 12-week core study, placebo (n = 51) or vildagliptin (n = 56; 50 mg OD) was added to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> treatment (1.5-3.0 mg/day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 40-week extension followed in 71 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Meal tests were performed at 0, 12, 24, and 52 weeks; <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In subjects completing 52 weeks with participation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> meal tests (n = 57), HbA(1c) (A1C) decreased in the vildagliptin/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> group (VM group, n = 31) but increased in the placebo/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> group (PM group, n = 26; between-group difference -1.0 +/- 0.2%; P &lt; 0.001; baseline of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects combined 7.7 +/- 0.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also, fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> decreased in the VM group but increased in the PM group (difference -0.9 +/- 0.3 mmol/l, P = 0.016; baseline 9.8 +/- 0.3 mmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Insulin secretion (postmeal suprabasal area under the 0- to 30-min C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> curve divided by the 30-min increase in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>) was increased in the VM group but was reduced in the PM group (difference +0.011 +/- 0.03 pmol/l 30 min/mmol/l, P = 0.018; baseline 0.036 +/- 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity during meal ingestion (oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> insulin sensitivity) increased in the VM group but was not altered in the PM group (difference +27 +/- 4 ml x min(-1) x m(-2), P = 0.036; baseline 246 +/- 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Insulin secretion related to insulin sensitivity (adaptation index) increased in the VM group but decreased in the PM group (difference +3.2 +/- 1.0, P = 0.040; baseline 9.1 +/- 0.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The change in adaptation index correlated to the change in A1C (r = -0.39, P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study presents evidence that DPP-4 inhibition by vildagliptin when added to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> over 52 weeks improves beta-cell function along with improved postmeal insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
