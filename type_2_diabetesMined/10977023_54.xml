<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 1,472 Dutch people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> completed the PAID along with other self-report measures of affect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Statistics covered Cronbach's alpha, exploratory factor analysis (EFA), and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), Pearson's product-moment correlation, and t tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Psychometric properties of PAID were compared for Dutch and U.S. diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Internal consistency of the Dutch PAID was high and stable across sex and type of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Test-retest reliability was high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Principal component analyses confirmed 1 general 20-item factor, whereas EFA identified 4 new subdimensions: negative emotions, treatment problems, food-related problems, and lack of social support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These dimensions were confirmed with CFA and were replicated in the U.S. sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The PAID and its subscales demonstrated moderate to high associations in the expected direction with other measures of affect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Dutch and U.S. subjects reported having the same problem areas, with U.S. patients reporting higher <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0700361" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">emotional distress</z:e> levels both in type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The Dutch and U.S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>20-item PAID appeared to be psychometrically equivalent, which allowed for cross-cultural comparisons </plain></SENT>
