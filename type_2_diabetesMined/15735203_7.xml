<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Thirty newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients, 30 type 2 diabetic patients with long duration of disease, and 56 control subjects were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To detect oxLDL Ab, the ImmunoLisa Anti-oxLDL Antibody ELISA was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ABI was estimated at rest by strain-gauge plethysmography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Carotid B-mode imaging was performed on a high-resolution imaging system (ATL <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53578">HDI</z:chebi> 5000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In patients with long duration of disease, IgG oxLDL Ab were significantly higher and ABI significantly lower compared with the other two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found a correlation between IgG oxLDL Ab and CCA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significant inverse correlation between IgG oxLDL Ab and ABI only in patients with long duration of disease was seen, demonstrating a close relationship between these autoantibodies and advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: IgG OxLDL Ab may be markers of the advanced phase of the atherosclerotic process and the response of the immunological system to the oxLDL, which are present within <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
