<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This randomized, multicenter, open-label, parallel-group study enrolled 246 adults (age 24-85) who had shown inadequate response in previous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy (HbA(1c) &gt; 7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prior therapy was withdrawn for 2 weeks, followed by randomization to repaglinide, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>, or repaglinide/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the first 12 weeks of treatment, repaglinide doses were optimized, followed by 12 weeks of maintenance therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">Pioglitazone</z:chebi> dosage was fixed at 30 mg per day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Baseline HbA(1c) values were comparable (9.0% for repaglinide, 9.1% for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>, 9.3% for combination) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean changes in HbA(1c) values at the end of treatment were -1.76% for repaglinide/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>, -0.18% for repaglinide, +0.32% for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> reductions were -82 mg/dl for combination therapy, -34 mg/dl for repaglinide, -18 mg/dl for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> occurred in 5% of patients for the combination, 8% for repaglinide, and 3% for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>Weight gains</z:mp> for combination therapy were correlated to individual HbA(1c) reductions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In summary, for patients who had previously failed oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> monotherapy, the combination repaglinide/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> had acceptable safety, with greater reductions of glycemic parameters than therapy using either agent alone </plain></SENT>
