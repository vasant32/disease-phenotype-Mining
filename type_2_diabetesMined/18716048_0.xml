<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we sought to determine whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> affects tilt table responses in older adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> not complicated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001278'>orthostatic hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty-two older adults (mean age 71.7 +/- 1.1) with diet-controlled or oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic drug</z:chebi>-controlled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001278'>orthostatic hypotension</z:hpo>, diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000763'>sensory neuropathy</z:hpo> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects underwent euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp and placebo "sham clamp" sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sequential euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamps were performed for 2 h at 40 mU x m(-2) x min(-1) (low dose) and 2 h at 80 mU x m(-2) x min(-1) (high dose), and each was followed by a head-up tilt table test at 70 degrees C for 10 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no incidents of presyncope during the sham clamp, whereas there were four presyncopal events during both the low-dose and high-dose tilts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although the low-dose clamp showed no difference in the response between sessions (two-way ANOVA), subjects demonstrated a significantly larger decrease in mean arterial pressure (P = 0.005) and diastolic blood pressure (P = 0.08) during the high-dose tilt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Doppler measures of middle cerebral artery velocity were no different between the two sessions at either dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The vasodilatory response to insulin can unmask orthostatic intolerance in older adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, resulting in presyncopal symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This could contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001278'>orthostatic hypotension</z:hpo> in combination with other factors such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011106'>hypovolemia</z:hpo>, and adverse effects from medications </plain></SENT>
