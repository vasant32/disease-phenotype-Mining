<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied whether the expression of genes relevant to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> biogenesis/function is induced in response to BPD and whether the response differs between morbidly <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (NGT) and patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The effect of stable weight reduction after BPD on metabolic variables and expression of nuclear genes encoding for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> proteins or regulators of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> function was investigated in skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity was assessed by euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp and substrate oxidation by indirect calorimetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both NGT and type 2 diabetic patients showed a net improvement of insulin sensitivity, with the latter also showing blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> normalisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>NGT patients had a large increase in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> oxidation and substantial reduction in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> oxidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, type 2 diabetic patients had a blunted response to BPD in terms of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> oxidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NGT patients showed increased expression of genes encoding mitofusin 2, porin or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50744">citrate</z:chebi> synthase; no significant changes were detected in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The expression of genes regulating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> activity (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi>-1beta [also known as PPARGC1B], <z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi>-1alpha [also known as PPARGC1A], PPARdelta [also known as PPARD], SIRT1) was induced only in NGT patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These findings indicate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> after BPD exerts a beneficial effect on insulin sensitivity via mechanisms that are independent of the expression of genes involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> biogenesis/activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the observation that gene expression is not altered with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> in type 2 diabetic patients while it is induced in NGT patients suggests a heritable component </plain></SENT>
