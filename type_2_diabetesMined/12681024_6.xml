<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 1856 patients from three randomized, double-blind, multicentre, parallel-group clinical trials were stratified at baseline according to HbA1C (&lt; 8% or &gt; or = 8%), age (&lt; 65 years or &gt; or = 65 years) and body mass index (BMI; &lt; 28 kg/m2 or &gt; or = 28 kg/m2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effects of study treatments on HbA1C and the incidence of hypoglycaemic symptoms were determined in each subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The combination treatments were more effective than either monotherapy irrespective of baseline HbA1C, age or BMI in each trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Antihyperglycaemic effects were greater in patients with HbA1C &gt; or = 8% at baseline, especially with the combinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The majority of hypoglycaemic symptoms with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi>-containing treatments occurred in patients with HbA1C &lt; 8% at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neither age nor BMI had a marked effect on the efficacy of the combination treatments, and there was no increase in hypoglycaemic symptoms in older patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Single-tablet <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> combination treatment is more effective than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> monotherapy, and is well tolerated in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> inadequately controlled by diet and exercise or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> monotherapy, irrespective of their severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> at baseline, age or weight </plain></SENT>
