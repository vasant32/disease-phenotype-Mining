<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To assess the safety of vildagliptin versus <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> comparators (ACs) with regard to organs, systems or tissues of particular interest in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2DM) and areas of potential concern with dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-4) inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were pooled from 38 studies where vildagliptin was given for &gt; or =12 to &gt; 104 weeks in patients with T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Absolute and exposure-adjusted incidence rates and Peto odds ratios (ORs) versus ACs with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were &gt; 7000 subject-years of exposure (SYE) to vildagliptin 50 mg bid and &gt; 6500 SYE to ACs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For mild hepatic enzyme elevations with and without <z:mp ids='MP_0005344'>elevated bilirubin levels</z:mp>, the ORs for vildagliptin 50 mg bid were 1.24 (95% CI: [0.80, 1.93]) and 1.19 (95% CI: [0.29, 4.90]), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The exposure-adjusted incidences of markedly elevated hepatic enzymes and for enzyme elevations with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> &gt; or = 2x ULN with vildagliptin 50 mg bid were &lt; or = those in the ACs group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For hepatic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001733'>pancreatitis</z:hpo>-related AEs, the ORs for vildagliptin 50 mg bid were 0.87 (95% CI: [0.64, 1.19]) and 0.70 (95% CI: [0.26, 1.88]), respectively, and for any AE in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections and infestations</z:e> SOC, this was 1.04 (95% CI: [0.96, 1.13]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidences of skin-related AEs were low and the risk with vildagliptin 50 mg bid was not significantly different from ACs [(OR = 1.10 (95% CI: [0.80, 1.51])] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present meta-analyses indicate that vildagliptin was not associated with increased risk of hepatic events or hepatic enzyme elevations indicative of drug-induced liver injury, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001733'>pancreatitis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> or skin-related toxicity </plain></SENT>
