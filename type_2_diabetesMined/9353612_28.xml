<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of transcutaneous electrotherapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> painful <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Thirty-one patients with symptoms and signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> were randomized to the electrotherapy or sham treatment (control) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The electrostimulation was given by a portable unit (H-Wave machine) than generated a biphasic, exponentially decaying waveform (pulse width 4 ms, 25-35 V, &gt; or = 2 Hz) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients treated each of their lower extremities for 30 min daily for 4 weeks at home </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nine patients from the sham-treatment group participated for a second period, during which <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them received the active electrotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patient's degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112117" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pain and discomfort</z:e> was graded on a scale of 0 to 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the sham-treated group (n = 13), the neuropathic symptoms improved in five (38%) patients, and the pain score declined from 2.92 +/- 0.13 to 2.38 +/- 0.26 (P &lt; 0.04), suggesting a procedure-related placebo effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the electrotherapy group (n = 18), symptomatic improvement was seen in 15 (83%) cases, 3 of which were completely asymptomatic; the pain score declined from 3.17 +/- 0.12 to 1.44 +/- 0.25 (P &lt; 0.01) and the posttreatment pain scores were considerably lower (P &lt; 0.03), indicating a substantial treatment effect over and above any placebo influence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients in the electrotherapy group reported greater reduction in symptoms (52 +/- 7% vs. 27 +/- 10% in control subjects, P &lt; 0.05) on an analog scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the electrotherapy decreased pain scores (from 3.0 +/- 0.62 to 1.56 +/- 0.32, P &lt; 0.02) in nine patients who had received sham treatment earlier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A form of transcutaneous electrotherapy ameliorated the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112117" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pain and discomfort</z:e> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This novel modality offers a potential non-pharmacological treatment option </plain></SENT>
