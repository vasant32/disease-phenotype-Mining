<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fundus photography was performed at median 10 (range 6-21) and 28 (27-37) gestational weeks in 80 of 110 (73%) consecutively referred pregnant women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> was classified in five stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Progression was defined as at least one stage of deterioration of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> and/or development of macular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> on at least <z:mp ids='MP_0005163'>one eye</z:mp> between the two examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Macular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> was defined as <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> thickening and/or hard exudates within a diameter of 1,500 microm in the macula area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, mainly mild, was present in 11 (14%) women in early pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 3 years (range 0-16 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At baseline, HbA(1c) was 6.4% (1.0) (mean [SD]), systolic BP 121 (13) and diastolic BP 72 (9) mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prior to pregnancy, 22 (28%) women had been on insulin treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During pregnancy 74 women (93%) were treated with insulin and 11 (14%) with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Progression of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> was observed in 11 (14%) women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Progression was mainly mild, but one woman with poor glycaemic control and uncontrolled <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> progressed from mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> to sight-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> with proliferations, clinically significant macular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000505'>impaired vision</z:hpo> in both eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Progression of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> was associated with a longer duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (p = 0.03) and insulin treatment before pregnancy (p = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Despite a low risk of progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> in pregnant women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, sight-threatening deterioration did occur </plain></SENT>
