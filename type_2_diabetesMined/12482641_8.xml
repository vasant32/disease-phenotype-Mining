<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty-six patients were treated for 2 months with repaglinide, added to either diet (n=21) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (n=25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A control group of 29 patients, matched for age, weight and glycaemic control, on either diet (n=13) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (n=16) was also followed-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Phases of insulin secretion (first-FPIS and second-SPIS) ware studied during IVGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Total serum <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> capacity and serum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) activity were measured to assess <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HbA(1c) decreased significantly in the repaglinide-treated group (P=0.01), the difference being significant compared with the control group (P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FPIS increased significantly after repaglinide (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The area under the curve (AUC) for FPIS increased significantly (P&lt;0.001), while the AUC for SPIS and for total insulin secretion did not change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Insulin secretion remained unchanged after 2 months in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a significant increase after repaglinide in total serum <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> capacity (P&lt;0.05) and serum SOD activity (P&lt;0.0004); the difference compared to the control group being significant (P&lt;0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate the physiological effect of repaglinide on endogenous insulin secretion in a controlled, randomized, open-label study-there is a rise only in FPIS, which is the main beta-cell defect in type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This improvement in glycaemic control was accompanied by a beneficial effect on <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
