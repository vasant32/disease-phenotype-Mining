<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated to what extent this feature can be induced in human pancreatic islets by elevated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> or fatty acids, two major abnormalities of the diabetic state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 48-h culture period with 27 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> increased the intraislet proinsulin-to-insulin (PI/I) ratio 5.0-fold, owing to preferential decrease of insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The PI/I ratio in culture medium was enhanced 1.9-fold versus islets cultured with 5.5 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This effect of elevated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> persisted after normalization of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels: during 60-min postculture incubations at a basal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration (3.3 mmol/l), the PI/I ratio of secretion increased 4.9-fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ratio was also increased (14-fold) after renewed postculture stimulation with 16.7 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4495">Diazoxide</z:chebi> was added to culture medium to block <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced insulin secretion and thus investigate the importance of overstimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In cultures at 27 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4495">diazoxide</z:chebi> decreased the PI/I ratio of islet contents by 76%, the accumulated secretion to culture medium by 70%, and the release at 3.3 or 16.7 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> during postculture incubations by 85 and 86%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of these PI/I-decreasing effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4495">diazoxide</z:chebi> were reproduced during or after coculture with 5.5 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Culture with 0.2 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> and 5.5 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> decreased islet contents of proinsulin and insulin and increased the secreted products in culture media without affecting PI/I ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During postculture conditions, however, prior <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> culture enhanced the PI/I ratio of release at 3.3 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (from 2.2 +/- 0.4 to 5.4 +/- 0.9%, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Culture with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> together with 27 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> decreased islet contents of proinsulin and insulin and further enhanced intraislet PI/I ratios (from 9.3 +/- 1.1 to 13.4 +/- 2.5%, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> failed to affect PI/I ratios in culture medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in postculture incubations at 3.3 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, prior <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> culture further elevated the PI/I ratio of secretion (from 10.8 +/- 1.2 after previous 27 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> alone to 13.9 +/- 2.8% after <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We conclude that 1) long-term exposure of human islets to elevated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> leads to preferential secretion of proinsulin, and this effect persists also after <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> normalization; 2) the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> effect appears secondary to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of mature insulin granules; and 3) elevated fatty acids influence PI/I ratios of secretion by mechanisms that are, in part, incongruous with an over-stimulation effect </plain></SENT>
