<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> in individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> (TZDs) versus other oral antihyperglycemic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a health insurance claims database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study sample included patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who received an oral antihyperglycemic agent between January 1995 and March 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Those with any claims for TZDs were designated "exposed," and each was compared with five randomly selected unexposed patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Those with diagnoses of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> or who received digoxin or a <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretic</z:chebi> in the year before their index date were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary measure of interest was incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, which was defined as a hospitalization or outpatient visit with a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TZD patients (n = 5441) were younger than control subjects (n = 28103) but more likely to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> complications, receive <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitors</z:chebi>, beta-blockers, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, or insulin, and have undergone HbA(1c) tests or eye exams; they also had more comorbidities and higher costs (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, TZD use was predictive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> even after controlling for these variables (hazard ratio = 1.7, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adjusted incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> at 40 months was 8.2% for TZD patients and 5.3% for control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of this observational study suggest that TZDs may increase the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Physicians should use TZDs with caution in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, remain vigilant for manifestations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> in those receiving these drugs (especially patients with cardiovasculopathy), and consider alternate therapies for patients who develop symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, such as <z:mp ids='MP_0001954'>shortness of breath</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
