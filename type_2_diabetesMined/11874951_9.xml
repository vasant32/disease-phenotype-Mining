<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Much less attention has been paid to <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In particular, there are few data on apoB levels in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, most reports have focused on mean <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> levels and consequently there is little information on the frequencies of the various dyslipidemic phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Plasma and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, apoB and apoA1 were measured by standardized methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> particle size was determined by PAGE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The total cohort was divided into phenotypes by two different methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The first was based on <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (&gt; or = or &lt;1.5 mmol/l) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (&gt; or = or &lt;4 mmol/l), whereas the second was based on <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (&gt; or = or &lt;1.5 mmol/l) and apoB (&gt; or = or &lt;120 mg/dl) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For the overall cohort, plasma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> were elevated (2.13 +/- 1.6 mmol/l), total and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (5.34 +/- 1.1 and 3.28 +/- 0.88 mmol/l, respectively), and peak <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> size was reduced (252.9 +/- 5.8 A) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> was between the 25th and 50th percentiles of the general population (1.12 +/- 0.36 mmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The average level of apoB was 114 +/- 29 mg/dl, a value that is between the 50th and 75th percentiles of the general population and is higher than that for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, which was between the 25th and the 50th percentiles of the population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results of the phenotyping analysis were as follows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Using the conventional approach, only 23% has abnormal <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>, i.e., an <z:mp ids='MP_0000182'>elevated LDL cholesterol level</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Using the new approach, almost 40% has an elevated apoB and therefore an elevated <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> particle number </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Only 12.8% has <z:hpo ids='HP_0008356'>combined hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> based on the conventional approach, whereas almost one-third had the equivalent, hypertriglyceridemic hyperapoB-based on the new algorithm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The severity of the dyslipoproteinemia in this group was noteworthy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Although the average <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> was 3.91 mmol/l, a value just below the 75th percentile of the general population, the average apoB was 145 mg/dl, a value that approximates the 95th percentile of the population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The dyslipidemic profile of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is not uniform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>A substantial group have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> particle number and size whereas others have markedly abnormal profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis based on <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> and apoB rather than <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> revealed that more than one in five had hypertriglyceridemic hyperapoB, which is characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002155'>hypertriglyceridemia</z:hpo>, marked elevation of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> particle number, small dense <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>, and low <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>, a constellation of abnormalities that is associated with markedly accelerated atherogenesis and therefore justifies intensive medical therapy </plain></SENT>
