<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ethnic differences in the frequencies of these genotypes have also been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To date, most of these studies have been performed in white and Japanese populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the associations between <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> genetic polymorphisms in Chinese patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a case-control study, the ACE insertion/deletion (I/D) gene, the angiotensinogen (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AGT</z:e>) gene (M235T), and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> (AII) type 1 receptor gene (AT1 A1166C) were examined in 110 Chinese type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increased urinary albumin excretion (UAE) was defined as &gt; or = 30 mg/day on at least two occasions during a 6-week study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with whites, there were high frequencies of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AGT</z:e> TT genotype in Chinese control subjects (120/183 = 70%) and type 2 diabetic patients (74/110 = 67%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of the MM genotype were 5 and 3%, respectively, and those of the ACE DD genotype were 13 and 10%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although 9% of subjects carried the C allele, the AT1 CC genotype was not found in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Chinese type 2 diabetic patients with increased <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> (n = 56) had higher systolic blood pressure (160 +/- 26 mmHg vs 145 +/- 27 mmHg, P &lt; 0.001) than the normoalbuminuric patients (n = 54) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AGT</z:e> TT genotype (78.6% [44/56] vs. 55.6% [30/54], odds ratio [OR]: 3.0 [1.3-6.8]) and the T allele (88% [99/112] vs. 77% [83/108], OR: 2.5 [1.3-5.4]) were associated with an increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AGT</z:e> TT genotype (n = 74) had higher 24-h UAE than those with the MT or MM genotypes (n = 36) (median: 37.8 mg/day vs. 17.8 mg/day, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This association remained significant in patients with normotension (56 mg/day [n = 19] for patients with the TT genotype vs. 22 mg/day [n = 14] for those with the MT/MM genotype, P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The D allele carriers (DD or DI, n = 61) had higher serum ACE activities (75.5 +/- 29 U/l vs. 60.5 +/- 36.3 U/l, P &lt; 0.01) than the noncarriers (II genotype) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The median 24-h UAE also tended to be higher in the D allele carriers (38.9 mg/day vs. 21.4 mg/day, P = 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The lowest UAE was observed in patients with the MM/MT/II genotype (16.3 mg/day [n = 18]) and the highest, in patients with the TT/DD/DI genotype (52.3 mg/day [n = 43]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>No association was found between the TT genotype or D allele and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The high frequencies of the TT genotype and T allele in Chinese populations may contribute to the high prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The possibility of synergism between the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AGT</z:e> TT genotype and the ACE D allele should also be explored </plain></SENT>
