<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Gastric bypass and biliopancreatic diversion (BPD) are known to have a beneficial effect on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism superior to that of the other bariatric operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thanks to its excellent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> results and to its specific actions, BPD has proven able to guarantee permanent normalization of serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>, and cholesterol levels in the vast majority, if not the totality, of operated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, clinical studies on the duration of these effects in large patient populations are still lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The files of 312 BPD <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> operated on from June 1984 to January 1993 were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pre- and postoperative serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>, and cholesterol levels, along with arterial pressure measurements, were considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After BPD, fasting serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration fell within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but two of the operated subjects and remained in the physiological range in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but six up until 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> and total cholesterol steadily normalized in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects with abnormally high preoperative values, and arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> disappeared in the vast majority of the preoperatively hypertensive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: BPD proved able to reverse <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the major components of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> in nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the operated subjects, with results being strictly maintained over a 10-year follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This outcome, which far exceeds those following similar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> at short or long term obtained by any other means, confirms the existence of specific actions of BPD on the major components of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
