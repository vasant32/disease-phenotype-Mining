<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Because <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> toxicity per se leads to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, the determination of the primary metabolic alterations leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> is best accomplished in individuals who are at an increased risk to develop type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, 48 subjects with IGT and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (IR), characterized by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps, were compared with 52 healthy insulin-sensitive (IS) control subjects with respect to the relationship between the plasma levels of TNF-alpha, IGF-I, GH, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi>, FFA, leptin, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between the IR and the IS groups, there were no significant differences in the plasma concentrations of TNF-alpha, GH, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi>, IGF-I, and leptin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, plasma FFA levels were significantly elevated in the IR group compared with the IS group after matching for BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The plasma concentrations of FFA, but not TNF-alpha, IGF-I, GH, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi>, are elevated in patients at an early stage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, suggesting that FFAs, but not the other modulators of the IRS system, may be a primary metabolic abnormality leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
