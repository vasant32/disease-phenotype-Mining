<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prospective <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study (UKPDS), initiated in 1977, was set up to determine whether improved blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> will prevent the complications of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The UKPDS was also designed to determine whether there are differences between conventional policy (diet therapy) and three different regimens of intensive treatment policy, based on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, or insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interim efficacy analyses revealed that the intensive policies with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi>, insulin, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> were equally effective in reducing fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and HbA1c measurements steadily increased with time, reflecting ongoing deterioration of beta-cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">Cardiovascular disease</z:e> was the major cause of complications, and the risk factors included raised <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> concentrations, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003233'>low HDL cholesterol</z:hpo> concentrations, elevated blood pressure, elevated HbA1c concentrations, and smoking </plain></SENT>
