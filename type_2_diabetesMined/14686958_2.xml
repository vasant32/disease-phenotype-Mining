<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in postmenopausal women improves menopausal symptoms, decreases the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521170" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">osteoporotic fracture</z:e>, but the effects on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> remain controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To test the hypothesis that HRT may have beneficial effects on the cardiovascular risk profile in postmenopausal women with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and fifty postmenopausal patients with type 1 (T1DM) and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2DM) were randomized to receive HRT (Kliofem) or placebo for 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We monitored the effects on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, including <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile, glycaemic control, blood pressure and body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>) cholesterol was associated with a nonsignificant decrease [-0.14 mmol/l (CI=-0.44, 0.17) (p=0.37)] in the Kliofem-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Total cholesterol fell by 0.42 mmol/l (CI=-0.78, -0.05) (p=0.027) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">High-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>) cholesterol was reduced by a mean of 0.07 mmol/l compared to a mean rise of 0.12 mmol/l on placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were apparent differences in the treatment effects between T1DM and T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no change in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13850">apoprotein</z:chebi> B and no effect on glycaemic control, blood pressure or menopausal symptom scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the Kliofem group, BMI fell by 0.66 kg/m2 compared to an increase of 0.14 kg/m2 for placebo patients (p=0.046) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although the long-term effects of HRT in women with or without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> appear to suggest that some types of HRT either confer no cardiovascular protection or may increase risk, the impact of Kliofem diabetic women on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> is probably neutral </plain></SENT>
