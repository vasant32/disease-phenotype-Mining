<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein (ChREBP) is a transcription factor that has been shown to regulate carbohydrate metabolism in the liver and pancreatic beta-cells in response to elevated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because few genes have been identified so far as bona fide ChREBP-target genes, we have performed a genome-wide analysis of the ChREBP transcriptome in pancreatic beta-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Chromatin immunoprecipitation and high-density oligonucleotide tiling arrays (ChIP-chip; Agilent Technologies) using MIN6 pancreatic beta-cell extracts were performed together with transcriptional and other analysis using standard techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One of the genes identified by ChIP-chip and linked to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> sensing and insulin secretion was aryl <z:chebi fb="59" ids="24632">hydrocarbon</z:chebi> receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT)/<z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-inducible factor-1beta (HIF-1beta), a transcription factor implicated in altered gene expression and pancreatic-islet dysfunction in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We first confirmed that elevated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations decreased ARNT/HIF-1beta levels in INS-1 (832/13) cells and primary mouse islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Demonstrating a role for ChREBP in ARNT gene regulation, ChREBP silencing increased ARNT <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels in INS-1 (832/13) cells, and ChREBP overexpression decreased ARNT <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in INS-1 (832/13) cells and primary mouse islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that ChREBP and Max-like protein X (MLX) bind on the ARNT/HIF-1beta promoter on the proximal region that also confers the negative <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> responsiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that ChREBP acts as a novel repressor of the ARNT/HIF-1beta gene and might contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta-cell dysfunction</z:hpo> induced by glucotoxicity </plain></SENT>
