<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of a nurse-led <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> clinic with conventional community care in general practice in the management of uncontrolled <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 120 men and women outpatient attendees (61% non-Caucasian) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and a seated blood pressure (BP) &gt;or=140/80 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were being treated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and 71% had increased urinary albumin excretion (UAE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were allocated to either a nurse-led <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> clinic or conventional primary care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome measure was a change in systolic BP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Secondary outcome measures were total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, total <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, HbA(1c), UAE, serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, and changes in absolute <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> (CHD) risk scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean (95% CI) difference in the decrement of systolic BP was 12.6 mmHg (5.9-19.3) (P = 0.000) in favor of the nurse-led group, whose patients were three times more likely to a reach target systolic BP &lt;140 mmHg compared with conventional care (P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significant fall in 10-year CHD (P = 0.004) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk (P = 0.000) scores occurred only in the nurse-led group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the reduction of diastolic BP or any of the other secondary outcome measures at 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Compared with conventional care, a nurse-led <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> clinic is a more effective intervention for patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and uncontrolled <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A target systolic BP &lt;140 mmHg is more readily achieved and may be associated with significant reductions in 10-year <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> risk scores </plain></SENT>
