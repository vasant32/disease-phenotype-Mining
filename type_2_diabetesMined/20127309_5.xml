<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although epidemiological studies report positive associations between glycaemia and LEA, the magnitude of the risk is not adequately quantified and clinical trials to date have not provided conclusive evidence about <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> lowering and LEA risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We synthesised the available prospective epidemiological data on the association between glycaemia measured by HbA(1c) and the risk of LEA in individuals with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We searched electronic databases and reference lists of relevant articles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We considered prospective epidemiological studies that had measured HbA(1c) level and assessed LEA as an outcome among diabetic individuals without <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> foot ulcerations or previous history of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of 2,548 citations identified, we included 14 studies comprising 94,640 participants and 1,227 LEA cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We abstracted data using standardised forms and obtained data from investigators when required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Data included characteristics of study populations, HbA(1c) assay methods, outcome and covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Study-specific relative risk estimates were pooled using random-effects model meta-analysis; <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> was explored with meta-regression analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall RR for LEA was 1.26 (95% CI 1.16-1.36) for each percentage point increase in HbA(1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was considerable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> across studies (I (2) 76%, 67-86%; p &lt; 0.001), which was not accounted for by recorded study characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The estimated RR was 1.44 (95% CI 1.25-1.65) for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 1.18 (95% CI 1.02-1.38) for type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; however, the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We found no strong evidence for publication bias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: There is a substantial increase in risk of LEA associated with glycaemia in individuals with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In the absence of conclusive evidence from trials, this paper provides further epidemiological support for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering as a strategy to reduce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath> in a population without <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> foot ulceration or former <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath>; it also provides disease modellers with estimates to assess the overall burden of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
