<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate urinary excretion of platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) during the different stages of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> (DN) in type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) as well as its clinical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-five cases with T2DM were divided into three groups: normoalbuminuric group [N-UAlb; urine albumin excretion (UAE) &lt;30 mg/24 h, n=25], microalbuminuric group [M-UAlb; UAE 30-300 mg/24 h, n=20], and macroalbuminuric group [L-UAlb; UAE &gt;300 mg/ 24 h, n=20] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The urinary excretion rates of PDGF-BB were determined by a quantitative sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cases and 27 subjects of control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The excretion rates of PDGF-BB in T2DM groups were markedly higher than that in control (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the excretion rates of PDGF-BB increased with the increase of UAE and there were significant differences among the three groups (P&lt;0.05) except the groups of M-UAlb and L-UAlb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Urinary PDGF-BB was also positively correlated with UAE, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> (TG), cholesterol (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>) and negatively correlated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance (Ccr), <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>), while had no significance correlated with glycohemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: PDGF-BB might play a very important role in the initiation and progression of DN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Measurements of urine PDGF-BB in T2DM could be used for early diagnosis of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
