<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two hundred and thirty-five patients, previously treated with a sulphonylurea, were randomised to receive either repaglinide (n=116, preprandially three-times daily) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> (n=119, preprandially once- or twice-daily) 6 weeks before Ramadan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During Ramadan, patients changed their eating pattern to two meals daily, and the daily dose of repaglinide was redistributed to two preprandial doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After Ramadan, patients resumed their regular meal pattern and treatment dosage for 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During Ramadan, a statistically significant reduction in mean serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24103">fructosamine</z:chebi> concentration from baseline was observed in the repaglinide group (-16.9+/-4.9 micromol/l, -3.8%, P&lt;0.05) but not the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> group (-6.9+/-4.8 micromol/l, -0.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Difference in change in HbA(1c) from baseline was not statistically significant between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of hypoglycaemic events with midday blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &lt;4.5 mmol/l was significantly lower in the repaglinide group (2.8%) than the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> group (7.9%) (P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Apart from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e>, both treatments were equally well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Type 2 diabetic Muslims using prandial repaglinide showed a trend towards better glycaemic control and had a lower frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> than patients using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> during Ramadan </plain></SENT>
