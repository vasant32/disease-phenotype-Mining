<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although the clinical manifestations of type 2 diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> and decline in kidney function are similar to those in type 1, the clinical course and the renal structural changes are more <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that an increased urine IgM excretion in patients with type 1 diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> was associated with poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present follow-up study we examine the prognostic value of baseline urine IgM excretion in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cohort of 106 (74 male and 32 female) patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> regularly attending our <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> out-patient clinic at Skane University Hospital in Lund </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were recruited prospectively under the period between 1992 and 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed-up until January 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The end point was cardiovascular (CV) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up time was 5 years (0.5-13 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Participants were divided according to degree of <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> and IgM-uria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During follow-up time, 28 (19 male and 9 female) patients died of CV events and 41 (26 male and 15 female) developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The risk of CV mortality was 2.4 fold, and the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> 4.9 fold higher in patients with increased urine IgM excretion compared to patients with low urine IgM excretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Stratified analysis showed that an increased urine IgM excretion was an independent predictor of renal and cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> irrespective of the degree of <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> (HR=3.6, 95% CI: 2.1-6.0, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, type 2 diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> patients with high urine IgM excretion rates carry an increased risk of renal and cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
