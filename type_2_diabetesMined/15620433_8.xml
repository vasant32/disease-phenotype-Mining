<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 125 patients (M:F=44:81, mean age: 58.4+/-9.1 years, BMI: 24.2+/-2.7 kg/m2, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>: 11.0+/-6.4 years) were randomly allocated to 12 weeks of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> treatment (4 mg per day) or a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Responders were defined as patients who experienced fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) reduction of &gt;20% or HbA1c reduction of &gt;1 (%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">Rosiglitazone</z:chebi> significantly improved glycemic control by reducing FPG and HbA1c (-3.4 mmol/l and -1.1%, P&lt;0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It also significantly increased HOMA(beta-cell function) (+9.7, P&lt;0.01) and QUICKI (+0.029, P&lt;0.001), and decreased HOMA(IR) (-1.73, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Females and those with higher waist-hip ratio made up a greater portion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>-responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Responders (45 patients, 75%) also showed significantly higher FPG, HbA1c, systolic blood pressures, fasting insulin levels and HOMA(IR), and lower QUICKI than nonresponders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among these parameters of responders, waist-hip ratio of non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subgroup, initial glycemic control of <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subgroup, and systolic blood pressure of both subgroups lost their significance after subdivision analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the baseline HOMA(IR) and QUICKI were significantly correlated with the response rate to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in multiple logistic regression analysis, HOMA(IR) and QUICKI retained their significance as the independent predictors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Even in Korean type 2 diabetic patients of long duration but with relatively preserved beta-cell function, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> improved glycemic control, insulin sensitivity, and beta-cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In this ethnic group, female gender, central <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and especially severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> were identified as predictive clinical parameters of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>-responders </plain></SENT>
