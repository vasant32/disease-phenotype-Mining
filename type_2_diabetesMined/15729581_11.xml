<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesised that, in its homozygous form, the functional T60N variant of LTA is associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and other features of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> among Danish Caucasian individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The T60N polymorphism of LTA was genotyped in the population-based Inter99 study cohort (6,514 Caucasian subjects) and in a group of type 2 diabetic patients by analysis of PCR-generated primer extension products using high-throughput chip-based matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectronomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Comparison of 1,401 diabetic patients with 1,470 matched <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-tolerant control subjects from the Inter99 cohort revealed that the frequency of the mutant at codon 60 in its homozygous form (N/N genotype) was higher among the diabetic patients than among the control subjects (14.6% [95% CI 12.8-16.5] vs 12.0% [95% CI 10.3-13.7], p=0.048; odds ratio=1.24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This association was even stronger among the 131 patients with early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (diagnosis at 40 years or younger) <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (21.4% [95% CI 14.4-28.4] vs 12.0% [95% CI 10.3-13.7], p=0.004; odds ratio=1.99) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, studies of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> (as defined by the 1999 World Health Organization criteria) in the Inter99 study cohort revealed that the frequency of the N/N LTA genotype was higher among subjects presenting one or more features of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> (n=4,425) than among subjects with no characteristics of this syndrome (n=1,752) (p=0.026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The T60N LTA polymorphism is associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and other features of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> among Caucasian individuals </plain></SENT>
