<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Normally formed singleton live births and intrapartum <z:hpo ids='HP_0003826'>stillbirths</z:hpo>, born to women with pre-conception <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during 1996-2008, were identified from the population-based Northern <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> in Pregnancy Survey (n = 1,505) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Associations between potential predictors and birthweight were analysed by multiple regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Potentially modifiable independent predictors of increase in birthweight were pre-pregnancy care (adjusted regression coefficient [b] = 87.1 g; 95% CI 12.9, 161.3), increasing third-trimester HbA(1c) ≤7% (53 mmol/mol) (b = 310.5 g per 1% [11 mmol/mol]; 95% CI 246.3, 374.7) and increasing maternal BMI (b = 9.5 g per 1 kg/m(2); 95% CI 3.5, 15.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Smoking during pregnancy (b = -145.1 g; 95% CI -231.4, -58.8), later gestation at first antenatal visit (b = -15.0 g; 95% CI -26.9, -3.0) and higher peri-conception HbA(1c) (b = -48.2 g; 95% CI -68.8, -27.6) were independently associated with birthweight reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pre-pregnancy <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> (b = -282.7 g; 95% CI -461.8, -103.6) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (b = -175.5 g; 95% CI -269.9, -81.0) were independent non-modifiable predictors of <z:mp ids='MP_0009674'>reduced birthweight</z:mp>, while greater maternal height was a non-modifiable predictor of increasing birthweight (b = 17.8 g; 95% CI 12.3, 23.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other predictors of birthweight increase were male sex, multiparity and increasing gestational age at delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Type or duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, socioeconomic status and ethnicity were not associated with continuous birthweight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Poor glycaemic control before and throughout pregnancy is associated with abnormal fetal growth, with increasing peri-conception HbA(1c) predicting weight reduction and increasing third-trimester HbA(1c) predicting <z:mp ids='MP_0009673'>increased birthweight</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Women with microvascular complications of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may require increased surveillance to detect fetal growth restriction </plain></SENT>
