<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To study the pattern of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidaemia</z:e> in African American, Hispanic, and White patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The data were collected retrospectively on 6450 patients followed in the Harris County Hospital District Community Clinics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The information collected from review of the charts included each patient's age, sex, race, body mass index (b.m.i.), duration of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, medications, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c, and fasting <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c levels in the three ethnic groups were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The risk of abnormal cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels was assessed with logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results show that in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> after correcting for age, sex and b.m.i., African Americans have the lowest serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> concentrations and Whites have the highest values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This trend holds true even in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and in patients with both <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The risk of having abnormal <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> is 74% lower in African Americans, and 42% lower in Hispanics than Whites based on logistic regression model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Despite better glycaemic control, Whites have a greater increase in serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> concentrations than Hispanics and African Americans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although African Americans are known to be at higher risk for cardiovascular complications than Whites or Hispanics, they appear to have lower <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> concentrations than Whites or Hispanics in the presence of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This suggests that an increased prevalence of other adverse factors must contribute to their heightened cardiovascular risk </plain></SENT>
