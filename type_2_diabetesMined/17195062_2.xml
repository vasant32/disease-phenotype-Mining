<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since CHD and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> share many risk factors, the aim of this study was to assess whether elevated sTM levels are associated with a lower incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A case-cohort study was performed in initially healthy middle-aged men and women based on data from the Monitoring of Trends and Determinants in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">Cardiovascular Disease</z:e>/Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg (MONICA/KORA) studies conducted between 1984 and 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Levels of sTM were measured with an ELISA in serum samples from 138 men and 86 women who developed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during follow-up (cases) and 534 men and 446 women who did not develop type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (non-cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An inverse association was found between sTM and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk after multivariable adjustment for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk factors, including several other markers of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Markers of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> were particularly strong confounders of the observed association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the fully adjusted model, a 1 SD increase in sTM was associated with a 27% decrease in the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (hazard ratio=0.73, 95% CI 0.58-0.91) in the total study population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We did not observe significant risk differences between men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These data suggest that, in initially healthy middle-aged men and women, levels of sTM are inversely associated with the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
