<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of monotherapy using nateglinide and the thiazolidinedione <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> with initial combination of the two agents on glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA(1c)) in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> inadequately controlled by diet alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This study consisted of a 28-week, double-blind, randomized, multicenter study that included a 4-week, single-blind, placebo, run-in period and a 24-week (shortened to 16 weeks), double-blind, active treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At the 16-week end point, nateglinide 120 mg, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> 600 mg, and the combination of the agents achieved statistically significant decreases in HbA(1c) in comparison with placebo and a baseline HbA(1c) of 8.1-8.4% (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The reductions in HbA(1c) were similar in the nateglinide (0.6%) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> (0.8%) monotherapy groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The reduction in HbA(1c) (1.7%) was greatest in the combination group; 79% of patients in the combination group achieved HbA(1c) levels of &lt;7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The combination group had a higher number of adverse events, primarily due to an increased incidence of mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> in this treatment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Nateglinide and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> are equally effective in decreasing HbA(1c) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, these reductions from baseline HbA(1c) values of &gt;8% are not adequate to achieve HbA(1c) levels of &lt;7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the combination of nateglinide and of a thiazolidinedione shows an additive effect that is highly effective in reducing HbA(1c) levels to the target of &lt;7% in 66% of patients, from a baseline HbA(1c) that is just above 8% </plain></SENT>
