<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate whether the addition of a single bolus of insulin glulisine (glulisine), administered at either breakfast or main mealtime, in combination with basal insulin glargine (glargine) and oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs (OADs), provides equivalent glycaemic control in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, irrespective of the time of glulisine injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A national, multicentre, randomized, open-label, parallel-group study of 393 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were suboptimally controlled [<z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c) (HbA(1c)) &gt; 6.5-9.0% and fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (BG) &lt;or=6.7 mmol/l] on their previous glargine and OAD regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A single injection of glulisine was added, either at breakfast or at main mealtime, to their existing therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The per-protocol group (n = 316) showed improved HbA(1c) (baseline vs. end-point) in the breakfast (7.4 vs. 7.0%; p &lt; 0.0001) and main mealtime groups (7.3 vs. 6.9%; p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Glulisine given at breakfast was equally effective in controlling HbA(1c) as glulisine given at the main mealtime [adjusted HbA(1c) mean difference (95% confidence interval): 0.0481% (-0.115 to 0.211); p &lt; 0.0001 for equivalence] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, 30.7% of patients achieved HbA(1c)&lt;or=6.5% at end-point but slightly more patients met this target in the main mealtime group vs. the breakfast group (33.8 vs. 27.8%; p = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This trend continued and was more marked when considering only those patients with HbA(1c) &gt;7.0% at baseline and who reached HbA(1c)&lt;or=7.0% at end-point (44.1% overall), with 52.2 and 36.5% for main mealtime and breakfast groups, respectively (p = 0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most postprandial BG values improved within each group, while the number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemias</z:e> was low and comparable between the two treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A single bolus of glulisine, added to glargine and OADs, resulted in significantly improved HbA(1c) levels, irrespective of whether glulisine was administered at breakfast or at main mealtime </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results may represent a simplified and effective approach to treatment intensification in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
