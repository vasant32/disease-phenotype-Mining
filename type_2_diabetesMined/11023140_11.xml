<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effect of intensive glycemic control on <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> in patients in the U.S. who have had type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for several years has not previously been evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We randomly assigned 153 male patients to either intensive treatment (INT) (goal HbA(1c) 7.1%) or to standard treatment (ST) (goal HbA(1c) 9.1%; P = 0.001), and data were obtained during a 2-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean duration of known <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 8 years, mean age of the patients was 60 years, and patients were well matched at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We obtained 3-h urine samples for each patient at baseline and annually and defined <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> as an albumin:<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio of 0.03-0.30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were treated with insulin and received instructions regarding diet and exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> were treated with similar goals in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 38% of patients had <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> at entry and were evenly assigned to both treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>INT retarded the progression of <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> during the 2-year period: the changes in albumin:<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio from baseline to 2 years of INT versus ST were 0.045 vs. 0.141, respectively (P = 0.046) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Retardation of progressive urinary albumin excretion was most pronounced in those patients who entered the study with <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> and were randomized to INT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients entering with <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> had a deterioration in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance at 2 years regardless of the intensity of glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the group entering without <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp>, the subgroup receiving ST had a lower percentage of patients with a macrovascular event (17%) than the subgroup receiving INT (36%) (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Use of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitors</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38215">calcium-channel blockers</z:chebi> was similarly distributed among the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intensive glycemic control retards <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> in patients who have had type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for several years but may not lessen the progressive deterioration of glomerular function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Increases in macrovascular event rates in the subgroup entering without <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> who received INT remain unexplained but could reflect early worsening, as observed with microvascular disease in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Control and Complications Trial </plain></SENT>
