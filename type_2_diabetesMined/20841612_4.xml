<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Neuropathic pain due to small-fiber <z:hpo ids='HP_0000763'>sensory neuropathy</z:hpo> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> can be diagnosed by skin biopsy with quantification of intra-epidermal nerve fiber (IENF) density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is, however, a lack of noninvasive physiological assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Contact heat-evoked potential (CHEP) is a newly developed approach to record cerebral responses of Aδ fiber-mediated thermonociceptive stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the diagnostic role of CHEP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: From 2006 to 2009, there were 32 type 2 diabetic patients (20 males and 12 females, aged 51.63 ± 10.93 years) with skin denervation and neuropathic pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CHEPs were recorded with heat stimulations at the distal leg, where skin biopsy was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CHEP amplitude was reduced in patients compared with age- and sex-matched control subjects (14.8 ± 15.6 vs. 33.7 ± 10.1 μV, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Abnormal CHEP patterns (reduced amplitude or prolonged latency) were noted in 81.3% of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The CHEP amplitude was the most significant parameter correlated with IENF density (P = 0.003) and pain perception to contact heat stimuli (P = 0.019) on multiple linear regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An excitability index was derived by calculating the ratio of the CHEP amplitude over the IENF density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This excitability index was higher in diabetic patients than in control subjects (P = 0.023), indicating enhanced brain activities in neuropathic pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Among different neuropathic pain symptoms, the subgroup with evoked pain had higher CHEP amplitudes than the subgroup without evoked pain (P = 0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CHEP offers a noninvasive approach to evaluate the degeneration of thermonociceptive nerves in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011882" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic neuropathy</z:e> by providing physiological correlates of skin denervation and neuropathic pain </plain></SENT>
