<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we investigated whether the 12Glu9 polymorphism in the gene encoding the alpha2B-adrenergic receptor ( ADRA2B) is associated with insulin secretion and/or the incidence of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We investigated a total of 506 subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> participating in the Finnish <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Prevention Study (DPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Participants were randomly assigned to an intervention group or a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anthropometric measurements and an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test were performed at baseline and at annual follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a subgroup of patients (n=83), a frequently sampled intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (FSIGT) was performed at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had similar anthropometric measurements and insulin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed significant interaction (p=0.003) between study group and genotype across the entire study population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the control group, subjects with the Glu9 allele had an increased risk of developing Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with subjects with the Glu12/12 genotype (odds ratio [OR]=2.68, 95% CI 1.02-7.09, p=0.047 for Glu12/12, and OR=5.17, 95% CI 1.76-15.21, p=0.003 for Glu9/9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This increased risk was not observed in the intervention group, who showed significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> during the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the subgroup who underwent the FSIGT, subjects with the Glu9/9 genotype showed the lowest <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin response (p=0.005 for trend) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The 12Glu9 polymorphism of ADRA2B is associated with impaired first-phase insulin secretion and may predict the development of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> who are not subjected to a lifestyle intervention </plain></SENT>
