<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We further investigated insulin treatment satisfaction between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seven hundred and eight patients with suboptimal glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> levels (7.0-10.0%) taking maximally tolerated doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and sulphonylurea were randomized to biphasic insulin aspart twice-daily, prandial insulin aspart three times daily or basal insulin detemir once-daily (twice if required) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 1 year self-completed Insulin Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaires (ITSQ) were administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lower scores indicated lower treatment satisfaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We tested for differences between the three groups for the ITSQ total score and for each of the five ITSQ domain scores adjusting for age, gender, ethnicity and education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 22 ITSQ subscales were completed by 554 (78.2%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Their mean (s.d.) age was 61.5 (9.4) years, body weight 86.1 (16) kg and median (IQR) <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration 9 (6-13) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sixty-five percent (358) were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median (IQR) 1-year ITSQ total score was lower in patients allocated to prandial therapy (76.5, 68.0-88.6) than in patients allocated to biphasic insulin (83.3, 74.2-90.2) or basal insulin (84.1, 73.5-93.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>With the exception of 'perceived glycaemic control', 1-year adjusted ITSQ scores were significantly different between groups for each of the ITSQ domains, with lower scores for prandial insulin compared with the basal or biphasic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Median (IQR) ITSQ scores were lower in patients with a gain in body mass index (BMI) &gt; 1.23 kg/mÂ² over 1 year (79.5, 69.7-89.4) compared to those with a lesser or no gain in BMI (84.1, 74.2-92.4) and in those with occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> (79.5, 69.7-88.6) compared to those with no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> (84.1, 73.7-93.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Specific measurement of insulin treatment satisfaction identifies differences between regimens used to intensify treatment for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Impact of treatment on lifestyle needs to be considered as a factor in the choice of an insulin regimen </plain></SENT>
