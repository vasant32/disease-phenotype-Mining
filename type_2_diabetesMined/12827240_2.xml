<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated whether Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> as a particular macrovascular risk factor associates with the thrombogenic PIA2 genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The PlA genotype was determined in 112 consecutive Type 2 diabetic patients additionally classified according to the presence of macrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-four non-diabetic patients with angiografically documented <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (CAD/ <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e>) and a further 59 non-diabetic subjects with no angiografical signs of CAD were investigated as genomic background control (n=103) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PIA-genotyping was carried out by standard restriction fragment length analysis (RFLA) of PCR amplified lymphocyte template DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall allelic PlA2- prevalence accounted to 34.8% (39/112) in diabetic patients as compared to 14.6% (15/103) in non-diabetic patients [OR 3.1 (1.6-6.1), p&lt;0.01] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This odds ratio increased to 7.0 (2.5-19.7), (p&lt;0.01) in subjects free of criteria of macrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In non-diabetic control subjects without CAD there was an allelic PIA2 frequency of 10.2% (6/59) as compared to 20.5% (9/44) in patients with CAD and a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> being less than either <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The PIA2 prevalence in the subgroup of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients with macrovascular complications did not differ from the respective value in patients without macrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>[29.0% (20/69) vs. 44.2% (19/43)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: This study confirms a trendwise association of PlA2 with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, but rather suggests an even stronger, highly significant association with the metabolic condition of Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This justifies the speculation that pathways dependent on the platelet alpha(2)beta(3) integrin <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> could be implicated in the pathogenesis of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> which lends further support to the "common soil" hypothesis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
