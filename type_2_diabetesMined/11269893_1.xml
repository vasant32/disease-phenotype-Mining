<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Type 2 diabetic patients (n = 154) receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> 7-20 mg/day and at least one 500-850 mg tablet <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> per day were randomized to receive additional miglitol or placebo for 24 weeks, titrated up stepwise from 25 to 100 mg trice daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Addition of miglitol to sulphonylureas and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (per protocol analysis) produced a statistically, significantly greater reduction in HbA1c (-0.55%, P = 0.04) and postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (-2.6 mmol/l, P = 0.0009) from baseline to endpoint than placebo (-0.2% and -0.6 mol/l, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reduction in fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was greater with miglitol than placebo, and there was a possible difference in favor of miglitol for fasting and postprandial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels, but these did not reach statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Flatulence and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> were reported by statistically, significantly more patients receiving miglitol than placebo, but adverse events overall were reported by only 10% more patients in the miglitol group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Miglitol can safely and effectively be added to long-term combination therapy in people with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> inadequately controlled with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
