<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 89 patients with both type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, ascertained from a large therapeutic randomized clinical trial, were included in this observational cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Morphological severity of DSP was expressed as the myelinated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e> in the sural nerve biopsy General linear models were used to assess the relationship between the morphological severity of DSP and various clinical risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (GHb) was significantly related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e> in univariate and multivariate regression analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This relationship was present in models in which GHb was handled either as a continuous variable or as a categorical variable with the highest significance level, with a GHb cutoff level of 9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After dividing patients into groups with optimal to moderate GHb &lt; or = 9%) and suboptimal (GHb &gt;9%) glycemic control, the difference in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e> between the two groups ranged between 3,461 and 2,334 per mm2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e> was also significantly related to duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and age of the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The severity of peripheral DSP expressed by morphological criteria was significantly related to glycemic control in type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Inconsistent with previously published electrophysiological data demonstrating a correlation between height and conduction velocity, increasing height is not associated with morphological severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Based on the results of the present study, it might be hypothesized that improving glycemic control will lessen severity of DSP in terms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e> loss in subjects with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
