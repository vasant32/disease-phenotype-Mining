<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Adiponectin has been proposed to play important roles in the regulation of energy homeostasis and insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In experimental studies, adiponectin has also been found to inhibit vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004893'>Decreased adiponectin levels</z:mp> have been described in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, and circulating adiponectin predicts cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because adiponectin appears to influence both insulin sensitivity and vessel wall <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp>, we examined insulin sensitivity and vascular function in relation with circulating adiponectin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied brachial artery vascular reactivity (high-resolution external ultrasound) and insulin sensitivity (minimal model) in 68 healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Brachial artery vascular reactivity was also determined in 52 patients with altered <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance: 30 subjects with impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (IFG) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> (GIT) and 22 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Circulating adiponectin concentration was significantly associated with insulin sensitivity (r=0.29, P=0.02) and with fasting serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (r=-0.29, P=0.02) in healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the latter, adiponectin levels were positively associated with arterial vasodilation in response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28787">nitroglycerin</z:chebi> (endothelium-independent vasodilation [EIVD], r=0.41, P=0.002) but not with flux-induced, endothelium-dependent vasodilation (EDVD) (r=0.007, P=NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, EIVD was not significantly associated with adiponectin in subjects with IFG, GIT, or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (r &lt; or =0.10, P=NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In a multiple linear regression analysis to predict EIVD in healthy subjects, age (P=0.012), sex (P=0.042), and adiponectin concentration (P=0.045), but not BMI, insulin sensitivity, or fasting <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, contributed to 39% of EIVD variance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Serum adiponectin concentration appears to be significantly associated with vascular function in apparently healthy humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This association seems to be independent of its link with insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
