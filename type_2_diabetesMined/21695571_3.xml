<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cpd-A, a potent and selective GCGR <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GRA</z:e>) was studied in preclinical models to assess its effects on alpha cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Studies were conducted with Cpd-A to examine the effects on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering efficacy, its effects in combination with a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, and the extent and reversibility of alpha cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> associated with GCGR antagonism in mouse models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> treatment with Cpd-A resulted in effective and sustained <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> lowering in mouse models in which endogenous murine Gcgr was replaced with human GCGR (hGCGR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment with Cpd-A also led to stable, moderate elevations in both glucagon and glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> 1 (GLP-1) levels, which were completely reversible and not associated with a hyperglycaemic overshoot following termination of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When combined with a DPP-4 inhibitor, Cpd-A led to additional improvement of glycaemic control correlated with elevated active GLP-1 levels after <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast to Gcgr-knockout mice in which alpha cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> was detected, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> treatment with Cpd-A in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> hGCGR mice did not result in gross morphological changes in pancreatic tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: A <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GRA</z:e> lowered <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> effectively in diabetic models without significant alpha cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> during or following <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GRA</z:e> may represent an effective approach for glycaemic control in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, which could be further enhanced when combined with DPP-4 inhibitors </plain></SENT>
