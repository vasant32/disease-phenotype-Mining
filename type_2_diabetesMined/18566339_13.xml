<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>Albuminuria</z:mp> can be caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> as a result of ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> rather than classic diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied whether renal vascular resistance (resistive index [RI]) of the main renal arteries could be associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> and further assessed the relationship between RI and aorta stiffness measured by brachial-ankle pulse-wave velocity (baPWV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We consecutively studied 150 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the absence of clinically overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001920'>renal artery stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Renal function expressed as the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the modified formula of modification of diet in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal disease</z:e> (MDRD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The RI [(peak systolic velocity -end-diastolic velocity)/peak systolic velocity] was measured with duplex Doppler ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: When the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> (uAlb) was defined as urinary albumin-to-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio (microg/mg x <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>) &gt;30, mean RI [(left RI + right RI)/2] was significantly higher in uAlb, compared with that in patients without uAlb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RI had significant associations with age (r = 0.398, P &lt; 0.0001), diastolic blood pressure (r = -0.398, P &lt; 0.0001), eGFR (r = -0.373, P &lt; 0.0001), and baPWV (r = 0.223, P &lt; 0.05), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that increased RI when defined as RI &gt;0.72 (median) was significantly associated with age (P &lt; 0.01, 95%CI 1.02-1.19), diastolic blood pressure (P &lt; 0.01, 0.86-0.97), and uAlb (P &lt; 0.01, 1.53-15.46), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, RI was an independent risk factor for uAlb after adjustment of both diastolic blood pressure and eGFR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Renal vascular resistance was associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> and aorta stiffness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Increased RI may imply the presence of any type of underlying renal damage, including ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
