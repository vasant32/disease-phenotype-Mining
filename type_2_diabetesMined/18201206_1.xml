<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Strategies for the addition of RSG in combination with GLIM were evaluated with data from two randomized, double-blind, placebo (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53450">PBO</z:chebi>)-controlled studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Study A - addition of RSG (4 or 8 mg) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53450">PBO</z:chebi> to continued GLIM 3 mg once daily; study B - addition of low-dose RSG (4 mg) prior to uptitration of GLIM (from 2 to 4 mg) vs. continued uptitration of GLIM (from 2 to 8 mg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Study A reported significant reductions in fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) from baseline to week 26 with the addition of both 4 and 8 mg RSG to GLIM 3 mg [-21 mg/dl (-1.2 mmol/l), p = 0.0019 and -43 mg/dl (-2.4 mmol/l), p &lt; 0.0001, respectively] and in <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c) (HbA(1c)) (-0.63%, p = 0.00015 and -1.17%, p &lt; 0.0001, respectively) from a baseline of 8.2 and 8.1%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the end of the study, target HbA(1c) &lt;7.0% was achieved in 43 and 68% of patients in the RSG 4 mg + GLIM and RSG 8 mg + GLIM groups, respectively, compared with 32% in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53450">PBO</z:chebi> + GLIM (GLIM alone) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In study B, addition of RSG to GLIM reduced mean FPG and HbA(1c) levels at week 24 from baseline [-28 mg/dl (-1.5 mmol/l), p &lt; 0.0001, and -0.68%, p &lt; 0.0001, respectively] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no significant changes with GLIM monotherapy in either study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Favourable effects of RSG + GLIM on insulin sensitivity, beta-cell function and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> biomarkers were also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> treatments were similarly well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Early addition of RSG to GLIM is an effective and well-tolerated treatment option to improve glycaemic control in sulphonylurea-treated patients with T2DM </plain></SENT>
