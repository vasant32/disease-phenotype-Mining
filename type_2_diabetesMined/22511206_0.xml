<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These pulses are thought to lead to plasma insulin oscillations, which are putatively more effective in lowering blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> than continuous levels of insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Gap-junction coupling of Î²-cells by connexin-36 coordinates intracellular free calcium oscillations and pulsatile insulin release in isolated islets, however a role in vivo has not been shown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We test whether loss of gap-junction coupling disrupts plasma insulin oscillations and whether this impacts <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We characterized the connexin-36 knockout (Cx36(-/-)) mouse phenotype and performed hyperglycemic clamps with rapid sampling of insulin in Cx36(-/-) and control mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results show that Cx36(-/-) mice are <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> intolerant, despite <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma insulin levels and insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, Cx36(-/-) mice exhibit reduced insulin pulse amplitudes and a reduction in first-phase insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These changes are similarly found in isolated Cx36(-/-) islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that Cx36 gap junctions regulate the in vivo dynamics of insulin secretion, which in turn is important for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Coordinated pulsatility of individual islets enhances the first-phase elevation and second-phase pulses of insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Because these dynamics are disrupted in the early stages of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, dysregulation of gap-junction coupling could be an important factor in the development of this disease </plain></SENT>
