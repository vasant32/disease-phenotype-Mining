<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data from the 1,840 women and 2,511 men randomly assigned in ADOPT to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi> for a median of 4.0 years were examined with respect to time to first fracture, rates of occurrence, and sites of fractures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In men, fracture rates did not differ between treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In women, at least one fracture was reported with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> in 60 patients (9.3% of patients, 2.74 per 100 patient-years), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> in 30 patients (5.1%, 1.54 per 100 patient-years), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi> in 21 patients (3.5%, 1.29 per 100 patient-years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence (95% CI) of fractures in women at 5 years was 15.1% (11.2-19.1) with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>, 7.3% (4.4-10.1) with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, and 7.7% (3.7-11.7) with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi>, representing hazard ratios (95% CI) of 1.81 (1.17-2.80) and 2.13 (1.30-3.51) for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The increase in fractures with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> occurred in pre- and postmenopausal women, and fractures were seen predominantly in the lower and upper limbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No particular risk factor underlying the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002757'>increased fractures</z:hpo> in female patients who received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> therapy was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Further investigation into the risk factors and underlying pathophysiology for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002757'>increased fracture rate</z:hpo> in women taking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> is required to relate them to preclinical data and better understand the clinical implications of and possible interventions for these findings </plain></SENT>
