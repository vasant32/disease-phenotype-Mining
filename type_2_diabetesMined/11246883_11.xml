<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Transgenic mice that overexpress the entire glucokinase (GK) gene locus have been previously shown to be mildly hypoglycemic and to have improved tolerance to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine whether increased GK might also prevent or diminish <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in diet-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> animals, we examined the effect of feeding these mice a high-fat high-simple carbohydrate low-fiber diet (HF diet) for 30 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In response to this diet, both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and transgenic mice became <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and had similar BMIs (5.3 +/- 0.1 and 5.0 +/- 0.1 kg/m2 in transgenic and non-transgenic mice, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration of the control mice increased linearly with time and reached 17.0 +/- 1.3 mmol/l at the 30th week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> of GK transgenic mice rose to only 9.7 +/- 1.2 mmol/l at the 15th week, after which it returned to 7.6 +/- 1.0 mmol/l by the 30th week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The plasma insulin concentration was also lower in the GK transgenic animals (232 +/- 79 pmol/l) than in the controls (595 +/- 77 pmol/l), but there was no difference in plasma glucagon concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Together, these data indicate that increased GK levels dramatically lessen the development of both <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> associated with the feeding of an HF diet </plain></SENT>
