<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) inhibitors have been introduced as therapeutics for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They partially act by blocking degradation of the incretin hormones glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent insulinotropic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (GIP), thus increasing circulating levels of active hormones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition to their insulinotropic actions, GLP-1 and GIP also promote beta-cell proliferation and survival, and DPP-IV inhibitors exert similar effects in rodent type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study objective was to establish whether DPP-IV inhibitor treatment prolonged survival of transplanted islets and to determine whether <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) was appropriate for quantifying the effect of inhibition on islet mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN &amp; METHODS: Effects of the DPP-IV inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">MK0431</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi>) on glycemic control and functional islet mass in a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> (STZ)-induced type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> mouse model were determined with metabolic studies and microPET imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> mouse model exhibited elevated plasma DPP-IV levels that were substantially inhibited in mice on an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">MK0431</z:chebi> diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Residual beta-cell mass was extremely low in STZ-induced diabetic mice, and although active GLP-1 levels were increased by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">MK0431</z:chebi> diet, there were no significant effects on glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After islet transplantation, mice fed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> diet rapidly lost their ability to regulate blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, reflecting the suboptimal islet transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By contrast, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">MK0431</z:chebi> group fully regulated blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> throughout the study, and PET imaging demonstrated a profound protective effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">MK0431</z:chebi> on islet graft size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with a DPP-IV inhibitor can prolong islet graft retention in an animal model of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
