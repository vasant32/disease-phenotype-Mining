<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared both estimates with true GFR, measured by the isotopic (51)Cr-EDTA method, in newly diagnosed, treatment-na√Øve subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 292 mainly normoalbuminuric (241 of 292) subjects were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects were classified as having mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal impairment</z:e> (group 1, GFR &lt;90 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)) or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> renal function (group 2, GFR &gt;/=90 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Estimated GFR (eGFR) was calculated by the CG and MDRD equations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood samples drawn at 44, 120, 180, and 240 min after administration of 1 MBq of (51)Cr-EDTA were used to measure isotopic GFR (iGFR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For subjects in group 1, mean (+/-SD) iGFR was 83.8 +/- 4.3 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>eGFR was 78.0 +/- 16.5 or 73.7 +/- 12.0 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) using CG and MDRD equations, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ninety-five percent CIs for method bias were -11.1 to -0.6 using CG and -14.4 to -7.0 using MDRD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ninety-five percent limits of agreement (mean bias +/- 2 SD) were -37.2 to 25.6 and -33.1 to 11.7, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In group 2, iGFR was 119.4 +/- 20.3 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>eGFR was 104.4 +/- 26.3 or 92.3 +/- 18.7 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) using CG and MDRD equations, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Ninety-five percent CIs for method bias were -17.4 to -12.5 using CG and -29.1 to -25.1 using MDRD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Ninety-five percent limits of agreement were -54.4 to 24.4 and -59.5 to 5.3, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients, particularly those with a GFR &gt;/=90 ml/min per 1.73 m(2), both CG and MDRD equations significantly underestimate iGFR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This highlights a limitation in the use of eGFR in the majority of diabetic subjects outside the setting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
