<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE Prior research has shown that less social support is associated with increased mortality in individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> illnesses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We set out to determine whether lower propensity to seek support as indicated by relationship style, based on attachment theory, is associated with mortality in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A total of 3,535 nondepressed adult patients with type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> enrolled in a health maintenance organization in Washington State were surveyed at baseline and followed for 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Relationship style was assessed at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with a greater propensity to seek support were classified as having an interactive relationship style and those less inclined to seek support as having an independent relationship style </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We collected Washington State mortality data and used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate relative risk (RR) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> for relationship style groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS The rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the independent and interactive relationship style groups was 39 and 29 per 1,000 individuals, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Unadjusted RR of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was 1.33 (95% CI 1.12-1.58), indicating an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> among individuals with an independent relationship style </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for demographic and clinical covariates, those with an independent relationship style still had a greater risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> compared with those with an interactive relationship style (hazard ratio 1.20 [95% CI 1.01-1.43]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS In a large sample of adult patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, a lower propensity to reach out to others is associated with higher mortality over 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further research is needed to examine possible mechanisms for this relationship and to develop appropriate interventions </plain></SENT>
