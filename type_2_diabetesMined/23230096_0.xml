<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the long-term effects of glipizide and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> on the major cardiovascular events in type 2 diabetic patients who had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD).RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSThis study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 304 type 2 diabetic patients with CAD, mean age = 63.3 years (range, 36-80 years), were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Participants were randomly assigned to receive either glipizide (30 mg daily) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (1.5 g daily) for 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary end points were times to the composite of recurrent cardiovascular events, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from a cardiovascular cause, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from any cause, nonfatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, nonfatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, or arterial revascularization.RESULTSAt the end of study drug administration, both groups achieved a significant decrease in the level of glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (7.1% in the glipizide group and 7.0% in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At a median follow-up of 5.0 years, 91 participants had developed 103 primary end points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intention-to-treat analysis showed an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 0.54 (95% CI 0.30-0.90; P = 0.026) for the composites of cardiovascular events among the patients that received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, compared with glipizide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The secondary end points and adverse events were not significantly different between the two groups.CONCLUSIONSTreatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> for 3 years substantially reduced major cardiovascular events in a median follow-up of 5.0 years compared with glipizide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results indicated a potential benefit of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> therapy on cardiovascular outcomes in high-risk patients </plain></SENT>
