<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is associated with defects in insulin secretion and insulin action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>Hyperglycemia</z:hpo> may aggravate these defects, a feature known as <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> correction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> in subjects with long-standing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> gives only short-term improvement in glycemic control after discontinuation of insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The current study attempts to identify any characteristics of patients with newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &gt;11.0 mmol/l) who would have a long-term benefit, in terms of glycemic control, from a brief course of insulin therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 16 subjects (52 +/- 2 years old [range 36-64], BMI 30.8 +/- 1.9 kg/m2) with newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had a 2-3 week course of intensive insulin therapy that was then discontinued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> fell from 13.3 +/- 0.7 to 7.0 +/- 0.4 mmol/l, and this improvement was maintained at the 1-year follow-up (6.7 +/- 0.3 mmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The insulin area under the curve for the posttreatment oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test also improved (8,251 +/- 1,880 before therapy, 18,404 +/- 4,040 directly after insulin therapy, and 42,368 +/- 8,517 pmol.min at the 1-year follow-up) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 1 year, seven of the subjects maintained good glycemic control on diet therapy alone, eight required oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agent</z:chebi> (OHA) therapy, and one required insulin therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The distinguishing features of those who did not require OHA or insulin therapy were that they required less insulin during the active insulin therapy phase (0.37 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.73 +/- 0.07 units.kg(-1).day(-1)) and were able to attain a lower fasting serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> at the end of the period of insulin therapy (5.9 +/- 0.3 vs. 7.7 +/- 0.4 mmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that in newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with elevated fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, a 2- to 3-week course of intensive insulin therapy can successfully lay a foundation for prolonged good glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The ease with which normoglycemia is achieved on insulin may predict those patients who can later succeed in controlling <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels with attention to diet alone </plain></SENT>
