<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 64 uncomplicated Type-2 diabetic individuals of higher middle class to rich socio-economic status were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two were allocated to conventional monthly hospital visits group-I (Gr-I) and 32 to HMBG with hospital visits at 3 monthly intervals group-II (Gr-II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In Gr-I, compared to baseline, HbA1c values decreased by 0.76% (95% CI 0.11-1.42) after 9 months and by 0.95% (95% CI 0.12-1.77) after 15 months but lost significance after 18 months follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, in Gr-II patients, HbA1c decreased significantly from baseline from 3 months and remained so at 18 months when it was decreased by 1.37% (95% CI 0.25-2.49) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0745153" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hypoglycaemic episodes</z:e> per patient year follow-up were significantly lower among Gr-II patients (0.172 vs. 0.354, P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Considering the cost for conveyance, wage loss, investigation, institutional cost, glucometer and test strips, the total cost per patient was quite similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present study suggests that HMBG with proper <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> education may be cost-effective at least in selected groups of individuals with Type-2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, even in a developing country such as Bangladesh </plain></SENT>
