<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the associations between intimate partner violence exposures and incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from 2001 to 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also estimated effects of duration and time since intimate partner violence on type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence.RESULTSOf 68,376 respondents, 64,732 met inclusion criteria at the 2001 baseline; of these, 23% reported lifetime physical intimate partner violence, 11% reported lifetime sexual intimate partner violence, and 8% reported moderate and &lt;2% reported severe psychological intimate partner violence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, adjusted for potential confounders, were 1.18 (1.00-1.39) and 1.08 (0.86-1.35) for more than one lifetime episode of physical and sexual intimate partner violence, respectively, and 1.78 (1.21-2.61) for severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0730557" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychological abuse</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Addition of updated BMI and other <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk factors reduced the physical intimate partner violence HR to 1.12 (0.94-1.33) and the psychological intimate partner violence HR to 1.61 (1.09-2.38).CONCLUSIONSPhysical intimate partner violence is modestly associated with incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Severe psychological violence may substantially increase type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
