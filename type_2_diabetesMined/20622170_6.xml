<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is due in part to an increase in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transport that occurs in the working skeletal muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> transport is regulated by GLUT4 translocation in muscle, but the molecular machinery mediating this process is poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to 1) use a novel imaging system to elucidate the kinetics of contraction-induced GLUT4 translocation in skeletal muscle and 2) determine the function of <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase alpha2 (AMPKalpha2) in this process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Confocal imaging was used to visualize GLUT4-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in transfected quadriceps muscle fibers in living mice subjected to contractions or the AMPK-activator AICAR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Contraction increased GLUT4-EGFP translocation from intracellular vesicle depots to both the sarcolemma and t-tubules with similar kinetics, although translocation was greater with contractions elicited by higher voltage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Re-internalization of GLUT4 did not begin until 10 min after contractions ceased and was not complete until 130 min after contractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>AICAR increased GLUT4-EGFP translocation to both sarcolemma and t-tubules with similar kinetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ablation of AMPKalpha2 activity in AMPKalpha2 inactive transgenic mice did not change GLUT4-EGFP's basal localization, contraction-stimulated intracellular GLUT4-EGFP vesicle <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath>, translocation, or re-internalization, but diminished AICAR-induced translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a novel imaging system to study contraction-stimulated GLUT4 translocation in living mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Contractions increase GLUT4 translocation to the sarcolemma and t-tubules with similar kinetics and do not require AMPKalpha2 activity </plain></SENT>
