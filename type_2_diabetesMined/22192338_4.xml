<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relationship between 12-month <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and subsequent cardiovascular outcomes is explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Overweight/<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects (N = 10 744), â‰¥55 years with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> and/or type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, received sibutramine plus weight management during a 6-week Lead-in Period before randomization to continue sibutramine (N = 4906) or to receive placebo (N = 4898) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was the time from randomization to first occurrence of a primary outcome event (non-fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, non-fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, resuscitated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> or cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For the total population, mean weight change during Lead-in Period (sibutramine) was -2.54 kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Post-randomization, mean total weight change to Month 12 was -4.18 kg (sibutramine) or -1.87 kg (placebo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> during Lead-in Period or through Month 12 was associated with a progressive reduction in risk for the total population in primary outcome events and cardiovascular mortality over the 5-year assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although more events occurred in the randomized sibutramine group, on an average, a modest <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> of approximately 3 kg achieved in the Lead-in Period appeared to offset this increased event rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> (3-10 kg) reduced cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in those with severe, moderate or mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Modest <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> over short-term (6 weeks) and longer-term (6-12 months) periods is associated with reduction in subsequent cardiovascular mortality for the following 4-5 years even in those with pre-existing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>While the sibutramine group experienced more primary outcome events than the placebo group, greater <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> reduced overall risk of these occurring in both groups </plain></SENT>
