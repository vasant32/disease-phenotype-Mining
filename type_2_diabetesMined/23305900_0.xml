<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are no studies investigating national trends in the use of bariatric surgery in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examine trends in the use of bariatric surgery in patients with and without type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> between 2001 and 2010 in Spain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified patients who underwent bariatric surgery using national hospital discharge data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Discharges were grouped by <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Incidence of discharges due to bariatric surgery were calculated and stratified by <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> status, procedure and year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We calculated length of stay (LOS) and in-hospital mortality (IHM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From 2001 to 2010 13,038 bariatric surgery procedures were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Over the study period 23.6% (n=3080) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients undergoing bariatric procedure had DM as a co-diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This prevalence increased from 17.3% in 2001 to 25.5% in 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>LOS and IHM were similar among patients with and without type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The proportion of subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among bariatric surgery patient has increased over time, in part due to an increase in the use of laparoscopic techniques </plain></SENT>
