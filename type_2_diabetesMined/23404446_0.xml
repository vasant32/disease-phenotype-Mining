<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The significance of heart-rate-corrected QT (QTc) prolongation, a finding often seen in these patients, is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, the importance of metabolic control and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> has been discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of different HbA(1c) levels and QTc prolongation on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality in the high-risk population of patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and foot <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, younger than 80 years, visiting our <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> foot unit, with a foot <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> duration &gt;4 weeks, were screened for participation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients on dialysis were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were grouped according to HbA(1c) level and QTc time ≤ or &gt; 440 ms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients (n = 214, median age 69.1 years) were grouped according to HbA(1c) level (HbA(1c) &lt; 7.5% [&lt;58 mmol/mol] n = 81, 7.5-8.9% [58-74 mmol/mol] n = 70, &gt;8.9% [&gt;74 mmol/mol] n = 63) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Baseline characteristics, including use of potential hypoglycaemic drugs, were similar between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During the 8 years of follow-up 151 patients died (70.6%) and HbA(1c) &lt; 7.5% (&lt;58 mmol/mol) was strongly associated with increased mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The highest mortality was seen in patients with a combination of HbA(1c) &lt; 7.5% (&lt;58 mmol/mol) and QTc prolongation, with an 8 year mortality of 92.1% as compared with 48.8% in those with HbA(1c) &lt; 7.5% (&lt;58 mmol/mol) but without QTc prolongation </plain></SENT>
