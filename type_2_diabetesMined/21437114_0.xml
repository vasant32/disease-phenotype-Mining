<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The EXPERIENCE trial was a one-year randomized controlled trial conducted at primary, secondary and tertiary care facilities in Europe and North America </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary study endpoint was difference in glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (A(1c)) between randomized groups at 26 weeks, and results from that phase have been reported previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present report concerns results from the second 26-week extension phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also consider the applicability of the design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The trial recruited 727 patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> who, prior to randomization, were using two or more oral <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> agents and whose A(1c) was ≥ 8.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomized to two treatment settings: Group 1 (usual care with the option of INH) or Group 2 (usual care only) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Usual care included adjusting oral therapy (optimizing current regimen or adding/deleting agents) and/or initiating subcutaneous (SC) insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, insulin was initiated by more (odds ratio [OR] 6.0;95% confidence interval [CI] 4.2 to 8.8; P &lt; 0.0001) patients in Group 1 (86.2%; 76.7% INH plus 9.5% SC) than in Group 2 (50.7%; SC insulin only) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The largest reduction from baseline in A(1c) was in Group 1 (-2.0 ± 1.2%) at Week 12 and in Group 2 (-1.8 ± 1.3%) at Week 26 (P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At 52 weeks, 79.8% were on insulin in Group 1 (67.4% INH; 12.4% SC) vs 58.1% (SC only) in Group 2, and mean (SD) changes in A(1c) from baseline were -1.9% (1.2%) and -1.8% (1.3%) in Groups 1 and 2, respectively (P = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Hypoglycemic event rates per patient month were 0.3 and 0.1 in Groups 1 and 2, respectively (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The EXPERIENCE trial showed that novel delivery technology can accelerate the adoption of insulin although some attenuation of differences is observed over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>And further, that this was achieved in a population of patients who appeared more ready to move to insulin therapy than observed in standard clinical practice, and a group of physicians who appeared more ready to adopt INH than the majority of physicians </plain></SENT>
