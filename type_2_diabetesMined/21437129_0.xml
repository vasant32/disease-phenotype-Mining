<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to review the trials investigating the effects of SMBG in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Medline was searched until June 29, 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of at least 12 weeks' duration were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data on the following aspects were gathered: patient and study characteristics, effects on HbA(1c), quality of life and treatment satisfaction, and methodological quality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The search revealed 9 original RCTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These studies were very <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo>, and 5 were classified as of high quality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The studies with the best methodology did not show an effect of SMBG on HbA(1c), the studies with the worst methodological quality did </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two out of the 4 studies that assessed quality of life showed a significant change in favor of the control group, 1 study showed a significant change in favor of SMBG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: We found an inverse relation between study quality and efficacy of SMBG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At this moment, there is no basis for general use of SMBG in noninsulin-treated T2DM patients </plain></SENT>
