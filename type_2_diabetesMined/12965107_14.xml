<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the possible effects of mosapride, a digestive tract prokinetic agent, on glycemic control in diabetic patients complicated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038354" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastropathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Enrolled were 36 type II diabetic patients presenting with mild digestive tract symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were given mosapride 15 mg per day for 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventeen cases were subjected to gastric emptying test according to marker method (administration of a capsule containing 20 pieces of radiopaque marker during breakfast, followed by abdominal X-ray imaging 3 and 5 h later) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 18 cases, HbA(1C) was improved by more than 0.3% for 6 months, whereby these 18 cases were defined as the improvement group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The remaining 18 cases were defined as the non-improvement group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the gastric emptying study, basal number of the residual markers before administration of mosapride was determined 3 and 5 h later to show 18.3+/-1.8 and 7.6+/-5.1, respectively, in the improvement group while after administration, they were reduced down to 11.2+/-5.1 and 1.4+/-2.5, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In sharp contrast, the basal counterparts in the non-improvement group were 19.1+/-1.5, and 16.4+/-3.4, respectively, whereas administration failed to reduce the number of the residual markers and they remained to be as high as 19.0+/-1.4 and 11.1+/-6.4, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Gastric motility in the improvement group was much more improved by mosapride administration relative to those in the non-improvement group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mosapride might elicit improvement in the glycemic control in the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860163" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic gastropathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
