<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine antidepressant use before and after the diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This study was a longitudinal analysis of diabetic and nondiabetic groups selected from a prospective cohort study of 151,618 men and women in Finland (the Finnish Public Sector Study, 1995-2005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the use of antidepressants in those 493 individuals who developed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and their 2,450 matched nondiabetic control subjects for each year during a period covering 4 years before and 4 years after the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For comparison, we undertook a corresponding analysis on 748 individuals who developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and their 3,730 matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In multilevel longitudinal models, the odds ratio for antidepressant use in those who developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 2.00 (95% CI 1.57-2.55) times greater than that in nondiabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relative difference in antidepressant use between these groups was similar before and after the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosis except for a temporary peak in antidepressant use at the year of the diagnosis (OR 2.66 [95% CI 1.94-3.65]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> case subjects, antidepressant use substantially increased after the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> diagnosis, demonstrating that our analysis was sensitive for detecting long-term changes in antidepressant trajectories when they existed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Awareness of the diagnosis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may temporarily increase the risk of depressive symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further research is needed to determine whether more prevalent use of antidepressants noted before the diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> relates to effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, side effects of antidepressant use, or a common causal pathway for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
