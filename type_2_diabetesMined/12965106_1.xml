<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used a novel radioimmunoassay to evaluate the effect of nateglinide on plasma concentrations of glycated insulin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten patients (5 M/5 F, age 57.8+/-1.9 years, HbA(1c) 7.6+/-0.5%, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> 9.4+/-1.2 mmol/l, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> 81.6+/-4.5 microM/l) received oral nateglinide 120 mg or placebo, 10 min prior to 75 g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in a random, single blind, crossover design, 1 week apart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were taken for glycated insulin, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> over 225 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and glycated insulin responses were reduced by 9% (P=0.005) and 38% (P=0.047), respectively, following nateglinide compared with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Corresponding AUC measures for insulin and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> were enhanced by 36% (P=0.005) and 25% (P=0.007) by nateglinide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Glycated insulin in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is reduced in response to the insulin secretagogue nateglinide, resulting in preferential release of native insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since glycated insulin exhibits impaired biological activity, reduced glycated insulin release may contribute to the antihyperglycaemic action of nateglinide </plain></SENT>
