<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined these parameters in Japanese males with Type 2 DM at ventilatory threshold (VT) to investigate the exercise capacity of Type 2 DM patients and re-evaluate the exercise prescription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifty-six Japanese Type 2 DM males without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0259749" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autonomic neuropathy</z:e> [age, 53.5+/-7.7 years; body mass index (BMI), 23.7+/-3.6 kg/m(2)] were enrolled and compared with 56 age- and BMI-matched healthy Japanese males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>VT was determined breath by breath during exercise test using a ramp protocol and rates of oxygen consumption (VO(2)), work rate (WR), HR, DeltaHR, %HR(max), %HR(reserve), and RPE were measured at VT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Type 2 DM patients had significantly lower VO(2) (3.6+/-0.4 metabolic equivalents (METs)) and WR (62+/-14 W) than controls (VO(2), 3.9+/-0.6 METs; WR, 74+/-13 W). %HR(reserve), (32.6+/-7.7%) was also significantly lower compared with controls (37.6+/-8.3%), while %HR(max), was not different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RPE was also similar in diabetics (12.4+/-1.5) and controls (12.9+/-1.2), however, it was significantly lower in diabetic patients aged 60-69 years (11.8+/-2.0) and those with distal symmetric <z:hpo ids='HP_0000763'>sensory neuropathy</z:hpo> (12.2+/-1.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate reduced exercise capacity in Japanese Type 2 DM males and the exercise intensity of 60%HR(max), 30%HR(reserve), and RPE 12 is recommended in elderly diabetics and those with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000763'>sensory neuropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
