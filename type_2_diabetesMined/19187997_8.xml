<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fasting serum 1,5-AG levels were lower in the type 2 diabetic group (18.0+/-7.0microg/mL) than in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (NGT, 25.4+/-4.0microg/mL), impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (IFG, 24.6+/-6.2microg/mL), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT, 22.1+/-6.2microg/mL) groups and were clearly correlated with glycemic values from the OGTT </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, 1,5-AG levels were significantly correlated with <z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi>(120) in each quartile of A1C, and the coefficients increased with higher A1C quartiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects with low 1,5-AG levels had both increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003059'>decreased insulin secretion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Decreased 1,5-AG levels are closely correlated with PPH and <z:mp ids='MP_0003059'>decreased insulin secretion</z:mp> capacity across a wide range of glycemia, even in relatively well-controlled <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
