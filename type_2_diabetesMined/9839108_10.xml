<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The HNFs also play a central role in the tissue-specific regulation of gene expression in liver and kidney, suggesting that patients with MODY due to a mutation in HNF-1 alpha, HNF-1 beta, or HNF-4 alpha may exhibit abnormal liver or kidney function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we have examined liver and kidney function in a series of Japanese patients with HNF-4 alpha/MODY1, HNF-1 alpha/MODY3, and HNF-1 beta/MODY5 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Clinical and biochemical data were obtained from Japanese subjects with HNF-1 alpha, HNF-1 beta, and HNF-4 alpha <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The clinical data included information on BMI, age at diagnosis, current treatment, and the presence and nature of any complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The biochemical studies examined liver and kidney function and included measures of alanine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> aminotransferase, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24190">gamma-glutamyl</z:chebi> transpeptidase, blood <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> nitrogen, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi>, total and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, and 17 serum proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The present age and duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were similar in patients with HNF-1 alpha, HNF-1 beta, or HNF-4 alpha <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, as was the age at diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the youngest generation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects were lean </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the subjects with HNF-1 alpha and HNF-4 alpha <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 50% were treated with insulin, as were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three subjects with HNF-1 beta <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>Retinopathy</z:hpo> was present in patients with each form of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>None of the subjects with HNF-4 alpha <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, whereas 36% of the patients with HNF-1 alpha <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 100% of those with HNF-1 beta <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> showed diminished kidney function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The three subjects with HNF-1 beta <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> also had abnormally high serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi>, and blood <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> nitrogen levels, which are consistent with impaired kidney function, and one of seven subjects with HNF-1 alpha <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had a mild elevation in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> and blood <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> nitrogen levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These values were within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range in the three patients with HNF-4 alpha <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although the HNFs play a role in regulating the expression of the genes for most, if not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, serum proteins, there was no decrease in the levels of any of the 17 serum proteins examined, and most were within or slightly above the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">Lipoprotein</z:chebi>(a) [Lp(a)] levels were elevated in the three patients with HNF-4 alpha <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and in one patient with HNF-1 beta <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and in a second patient with HNF-1 beta <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, Lp(a) was at the upper limit of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that as in white patients, MODY resulting from mutations in the HNF-1 alpha, HNF-1 beta, and HNF-4 alpha genes in Japanese patients may be a severe disease similar to classic type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In addition, they suggest that patients with HNF-1 beta <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may be characterized by diminished kidney function and perhaps <z:hpo ids='HP_0002910'>abnormal liver function</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to determine whether tests of liver and kidney function will be useful in the diagnosis and subclassification of MODY </plain></SENT>
