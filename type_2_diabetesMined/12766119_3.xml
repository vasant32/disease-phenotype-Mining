<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the renal vasculature cannot be easily assessed, but infusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi>, the substrate of endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase, leads to an increase in renal plasma flow (RPF) in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have examined the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> infusion on renal hemodynamics in hypertensive patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty-three elderly patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (age, 65 +/- 6 years; HbA(1c), 7.8 +/- 1.6%) with coexisting arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (158 +/- 19/83 +/- 11 mmHg) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020443" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated cholesterol</z:e> levels (total cholesterol, 215 +/- 33 mg/dl) were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These patients were compared with a young and healthy reference group (n = 20; age, 26 +/- 2 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> infusion (100 mg/kg over 30 min) on RPF and glomerular filtration rate were measured using the constant input clearance technique with p-aminohippurate and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15443">inulin</z:chebi>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> infusion similarly influenced renal hemodynamics in patients and reference subjects: RPF increased by 7 +/- 11 and 7 +/- 11% in diabetic and reference subjects, respectively (P = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Other parameters of renal hemodynamics such as glomerular filtration rate (5 +/- 5 vs. 4 +/- 4%) and filtration fraction (-1 +/- 8 vs. -1 +/- 9%) were not significantly different between diabetic and reference subjects, too </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi>-induced vasodilation of the renal vasculature is not different between a group of hypertensive diabetic patients and a young, healthy reference group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data were obtained using low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> infusion </plain></SENT>
