<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Moreover, PPARdelta augments physical endurance and increases oxidative metabolism, thereby averting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, we hypothesised that common variation in the PPARD gene is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and metabolic traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied variation in the exonic region of PPARD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based upon the results of variant detection and information derived from the HapMap data resource, we selected common variants and tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms for genotyping in 7,495 white subjects, including 1,416 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fourteen nucleotide variants were identified and a total of 12 variants capturing the common variation of PPARD were genotyped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the population-based Inter99 (ClinicalTrials.gov ID no: NCT00289237) sample we observed no robust association with homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-IR), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> measures or fasting serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similarly, no association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Based on thorough investigation, we conclude that common variation in PPARD does not significantly affect the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disease</z:e> in the population studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Given the confidence intervals that were found for effect size estimates, we can effectively rule out an increase in HOMA-IR of any tag SNP above 7% per allele, assuming an additive model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Likewise, we can exclude an odds ratio of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> above 1.27 per allele </plain></SENT>
