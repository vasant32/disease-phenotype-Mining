<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to investigate the clinical impact of reducing <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> in type 2 diabetic patients in an observational follow-up study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We enrolled 216 type 2 diabetic patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> during an initial 2-year evaluation period and observed them for the next 8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Remission and a 50% reduction of <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> were defined as a shift to normoalbuminuria and a reduction &lt;50% from the initial level of <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The association between reducing <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> and first occurrence of a renal or cardiovascular event and annual decline rate of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twelve events occurred in 93 patients who attained a 50% reduction of <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> during the follow-up versus 35 events in 123 patients without a 50% reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence rate of events was significantly lower in patients with a 50% reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A pooled logistic regression analysis revealed that the adjusted risk for events in subjects after a 50% reduction was 0.41 (95% CI 0.15-0.96) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, the annual decline rate of eGFR in patients with a 50% reduction was significantly slower than in those without such a reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The same results were also found in the analysis regarding whether remission occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides clinical evidence implying that a reduction of <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> in type 2 diabetic patients is an integrated indicator for renal and cardiovascular risk reduction </plain></SENT>
