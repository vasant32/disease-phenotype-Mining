<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: WFS1 type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk variants appear to be associated with impaired beta cell function, although it is unclear whether insulin secretion is affected directly or secondarily via alteration of insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to investigate the effect of a common WFS1 single-nucleotide polymorphism on several aspects of insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 1,578 non-diabetic individuals (534 men and 1,044 women, aged 40 +/- 13 years, BMI 28.9 +/- 8.2 kg/m(2) [mean +/- SD]) at increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were genotyped for rs10010131 within the WFS1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants underwent an OGTT (and a subset additionally an IVGTT [n = 319]) and a hyperglycaemic clamp combined with glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) and arginine stimuli (n = 102) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: rs10010131 was associated with reduced OGTT-derived insulin secretion (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, insulin secretion induced by an i.v. <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> challenge in the IVGTT and hyperglycaemic clamp was not different between the genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>GLP-1 infusion combined with a hyperglycaemic clamp showed a significant reduction of the insulin secretion rate during the first and second phases of GLP-1-induced insulin secretion in carriers of the risk allele (reduction of 36% and 26%, respectively; p = 0.007 and p = 0.04, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: A common genetic variant in WFS1 specifically impairs GLP-1-induced insulin secretion independently of insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This defect might explain the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948379" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">impaired insulin secretion</z:e> in carriers of the risk allele and confer the increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
