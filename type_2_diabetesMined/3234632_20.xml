<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The subjects for the present study were selected from a population based study in which 117 Type 1 and 510 Type 2 diabetic patients and 649 non-diabetic subjects were originally examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After exclusions, none of the subjects had any evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> or other diseases known to affect left ventricular function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were no consistent differences in systolic time intervals or echocardiographic variables of systolic function between patients with Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and non-diabetic control subjects; but patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> showed an increased fractional shortening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Female patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> showed an increased left ventricular mass not explicable by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Isovolumic relaxation period was longer in male (86 +/- 3 ms; mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) and female patients (84 +/- 6 ms) with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than in male (76 +/- 3 ms; p less than 0.05) and female (71 +/- 3 ms; p less than 0.05) control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Peak diastolic filling rate was lower in female patients with Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (12.8 +/- 0.8 cm/s, p less than 0.05) and in male (11.5 +/- 0.8 cm/s; p less than 0.01) and female patients (11.5 +/- 0.6 cm/s; p less than 0.001) with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> as compared to male (14.4 +/- 0.7 cm/s) and female (14.9 +/- 0.5 cm/s) control subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
