<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The K121Q polymorphism in ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1) is associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The possibility of other ENPP1 polymorphisms influencing these phenotypes has received little attention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to examine the associations of tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes of the linkage disequilibrium (LD) block containing K121Q polymorphism with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a Polish population, controlling for any effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We genotyped 426 type 2 diabetic case and 370 control subjects for seven SNPs in ENPP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the total group, neither type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> nor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> was significantly associated with any SNP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects, two SNPs were significantly associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>: the Q allele of K121Q (odds ratio 1.6 [95% CI 1.003-2.6]) and T allele of rs997509 (4.7 [1.6-13.9]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the LD block, four SNPs plus the K121Q polymorphism distinguished six haplotypes, three of which carried the Q allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the T allele of rs997509 sufficed to distinguish a 121Q-carrying haplotype that was significantly more associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than the other two (4.2 [1.3-13.5]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These other two 121Q-carrying haplotypes were not associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we found a new SNP, rs997509, in intron 1 that is strongly associated with risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The molecular mechanisms underlying this association are unknown </plain></SENT>
