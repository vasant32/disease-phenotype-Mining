<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AS160 is a newly described substrate for the protein kinase Akt that links insulin signaling and GLUT4 trafficking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we determined the expression of and in vivo insulin action on AS160 in human skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, we compared the effect of physiological <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> on AS160 phosphorylation in 10 lean-to-moderately <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> type 2 diabetic and 9 healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Insulin infusion increased the phosphorylation of several proteins reacting with a phospho-Akt substrate antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We focused on AS160, as this Akt substrate has been linked to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transport </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A 160-kDa phosphorylated protein was identified as AS160 by immunoblot analysis with an AS160-specific antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Physiological <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> increased AS160 phosphorylation 2.9-fold in skeletal muscle of control subjects (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Insulin-stimulated AS160 phosphorylation was reduced 39% (P &lt; 0.05) in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>AS160 protein expression was similar in type 2 diabetic and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Impaired AS160 phosphorylation was related to aberrant Akt signaling; insulin action on Akt Ser(473) phosphorylation was not significantly reduced in type 2 diabetic compared with control subjects, whereas Thr(308) phosphorylation was impaired 51% (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, physiological <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> increases AS160 phosphorylation in human skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, defects in insulin action on AS160 may impair GLUT4 trafficking in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
