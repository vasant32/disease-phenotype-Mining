<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fasting rats were given 50 mg/kg of NAT, 1 mg/kg of GB or 5% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53448">methyl cellulose</z:chebi> (vehicle) as control and then immediately given oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> 1 g/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> increase in insulin levels in portal blood peaked at 15 min in the NAT group, while insulin levels in the GB group continued to increase significantly after 60 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> levels in peripheral blood were significantly lower in the NAT group at 30 and 60 min and in the GB group at 120, 180 and 270 min after <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> loading, compared with those in the vehicle group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, fasting rats were given NAT, GB or vehicle and then immediately given oral fat emulsion (soy oil 2 g/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> increase in insulin secretion was seen with NAT, peaking at 30 min, while TG, chylomicron and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39027">very low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> levels after fat loading were shown to be significantly lower with NAT than with vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the continued insulin secretion observed with GB led to no significant decrease in TG levels after fat loading </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> lipase <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in adipose tissue increased significantly 120 min after NAT administration in comparison with baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This increase was not noted with GB administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Abnormalities in early insulin secretion are closely associated with the pathogenesis of various disease conditions that combine to characterize type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, suggesting that normalizing early insulin response in portal blood represents an important treatment not only for postprandial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> but also for postprandial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020473" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperlipidaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
