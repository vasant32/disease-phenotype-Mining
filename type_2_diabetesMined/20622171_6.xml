<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> is an increasingly common disorder that predisposes to several medical conditions, including type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether large and rare copy-number variations (CNVs) differentiate moderate to extreme <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> from never-overweight control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays, we performed a genome-wide CNV survey on 430 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> case subjects (BMI &gt;35 kg/m(2)) and 379 never-overweight control subjects (BMI &lt;25 kg/m(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects were of European ancestry and were genotyped on the Illumina HumanHap550 arrays with âˆ¼550,000 SNP markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CNV calls were generated by PennCNV software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CNVs &gt;1 Mb were found to be overrepresented in case versus control subjects (odds ratio [OR] = 1.5 [95% CI 0.5-5]), and CNVs &gt;2 Mb were present in 1.3% of the case subjects but were absent in control subjects (OR = infinity [95% CI 1.2-infinity]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When focusing on rare deletions that disrupt genes, even more pronounced effect sizes are observed (OR = 2.7 [95% CI 0.5-27.1] for CNVs &gt;1 Mb) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> case subjects who carry these large CNVs have moderately high BMI and do not appear to be extreme cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Several CNVs disrupt known candidate genes for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, such as a 3.3-Mb deletion disrupting NAP1L5 and a 2.1-Mb deletion disrupting UCP1 and IL15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that large CNVs, especially rare deletions, confer risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in patients with moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and that genes impacted by large CNVs represent intriguing candidates for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> that warrant further study </plain></SENT>
