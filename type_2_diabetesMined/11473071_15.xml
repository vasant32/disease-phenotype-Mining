<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term effectiveness of a quality improvement program on care provided and patient outcomes in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A nonrandomized trial was performed with 312 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the intervention group and 77 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the reference group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The follow-up period was 42 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The quality improvement program focused on improving both the provision of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care and the patient outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The program consisted of clinical practice guidelines, postgraduate education, audit and feedback, templates to register <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care, and a recall system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data on the care provided were abstracted from medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Main outcomes on the provision of care were annual number of patient visits, blood pressure, and HbA(1c) and blood <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Main patient outcomes were blood pressure and HbA(1c) and blood <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multilevel analysis was used to adjust for dependency between repeated observations within one patient and for clustering of patients within general practices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients in the intervention group received care far more in accordance with the guidelines than patients in the reference group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios ranged from 2.43 (95% CI 1.01-5.82) for the measurement of urine albumin to 12.08 (4.70-31.01) for the measurement of blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No beneficial effect was found on any patient outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The quality improvement program improved the provision of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care, but this was not accompanied by any effect on patient outcomes </plain></SENT>
