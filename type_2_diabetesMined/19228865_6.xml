<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated coffee consumption in relation to risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVDs</z:e> and mortality in diabetic men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study including 3,497 diabetic men without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After adjustment for age, smoking, and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, relative risks (RRs) were 0.88 (95% CI 0.50-1.57) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVDs</z:e> (P for trend = 0.29) and 0.80 (0.41-1.54) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality (P for trend = 0.45) for the consumption of &gt;or=4 cups/day of caffeinated coffee compared with those for non-coffee drinkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Stratification by smoking and duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> yielded similar results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RRs for <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi> intake for the highest compared with the lowest quintile were 1.02 (0.70-1.47; P for trend = 0.96) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVDs</z:e> and 0.96 (0.64-1.44; P for trend = 0.69) for mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that regular coffee consumption is not associated with increased risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVDs</z:e> or mortality in diabetic men </plain></SENT>
