<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This article presents evidence related to the effect of glycemic control on the outcome of daily symptoms, microvascular complications, and macrovascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Literature limited to Medline and the Cochrane Library was searched primarily for randomized clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In terms of education, present intervention studies indicate a positive effect on surrogate end points such as glycemic control, knowledge, practical skills, and psychological performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Studies show improved glycemic control and plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profiles after moderate weight reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, this positive effect is limited in time because weight is regained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With regard to oral blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering drugs, clinical trials show a significant blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering effect of different available drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> have been shown to significantly reduce the risk of microvascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the U.K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Prospective <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study, intensive treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects reduced the risk for any <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related event and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A major problem is that many patients gradually experience increasing <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, creating the need for combined treatment with several drugs including insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Insulin treatment has been shown to be effective in achieving satisfactory glycemic control over several years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There is also a positive effect on hard end points such as microvascular disease in the eye, kidney, and nerves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, present evidence shows that optimal glycemic control can be attained in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, resulting in fewer disease-related symptoms and a reduced risk of late complications </plain></SENT>
