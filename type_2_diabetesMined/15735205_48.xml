<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the influence of a twice-weekly progressive resistance training (PRT) program, without a concomitant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> diet, on abdominal fat and insulin sensitivity in older men with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Nine older men (aged 66.6 +/- 3.1) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> participated in a 16-week PRT supervised program (50-80% of the one repetition maximum), for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> main muscle groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Basal glycemia, HbA(1c), diet, habitual physical activity, body composition, and upper/lower maximal strength were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity was determined according to Bergman's minimal model procedure and abdominal fat was obtained by computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The measurements were taken 4 weeks before training (-4), immediately before training (0), and at 8-week intervals (i.e., weeks 8 and 16) during the 16-week training period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No significant variation was observed in any of the above selected parameters during the 4-week control period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After PRT, both leg and arm maximal strength increased significantly by 17.1 and 18.2%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Visceral and subcutaneous abdominal fat decreased significantly by 10.3% (from 249.5 +/- 97.9 to 225.6 +/- 96.6 cm(3), P &lt; 0.01) and by 11.2% (from 356.0 +/- 127.5 to 308.6 +/- 118.8 cm(3), P &lt; 0.01), respectively, while no changes were observed in body mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PRT significantly <z:mp ids='MP_0002891'>increased insulin sensitivity</z:mp> by 46.3% (from 2.0 +/- 1.2 to 2.8 +/- 1.6  </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>ml(-1), P &lt; 0.01), whereas it significantly decreased (-7.1%, P &lt; 0.05) fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (from 146.6 +/- 28.3 to 135.0 +/- 29.3 mg/dl) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Finally, a 15.5% increase in energy intake (from 2,287.1 +/- 354.7 to 2,619.0 +/- 472.1 kcal/day, P &lt; 0.05) was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Two sessions per week of PRT, without a concomitant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> diet, significantly improves insulin sensitivity and fasting glycemia and decreases abdominal fat in older men with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
