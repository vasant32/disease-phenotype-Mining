<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: DIO rats were acutely given a single dose of oral sCT (0.5 and 2 mg/kg), its oral vehicle N-(5-chlorosalicyloyl)-8-aminocaprylic acid (5-CNAC) or injectable sCT (5 and 10 µg/kg) (n = 8), followed by oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Other DIO rats were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> treated twice daily with oral vehicle 5-CNAC (n = 6), oral sCT (0.5 and 2 mg/kg) or injectable sCT (10 µg/kg) (n = 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fasting and postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and pancreatic hormones, body weight and insulin sensitivity were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A single dose of oral sCT acutely reduced <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin area under the curve during OGTT by approximately 65 and 85%, respectively, compared with vehicle (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> treatment with oral sCT significantly reduced both fasting and postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin levels by approximately 1.5 mM and 65%, respectively, compared with vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Oral sCT concomitantly improved insulin sensitivity (homeostatic model assessment, HOMA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, injectable sCT resembling higher systemic exposure did not improve glycaemic control, either acutely or during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, both oral and injectable sCT <z:mp ids='MP_0001262'>reduced body weight</z:mp> by 15% compared with vehicle (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A novel oral form of sCT showed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> effects in DIO rats by improving glycaemic control, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis, insulin sensitivity and body weight </plain></SENT>
