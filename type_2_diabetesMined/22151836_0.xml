<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that rapid-acting insulin has a beneficial postprandial effect on coagulation and fibrinolysis compared with intermediate-acting insulin because of its ability to lower postprandial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was tested in a parallel controlled study in well-controlled patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> assigned to bedtime neutral protamine Hagedorn (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e>) insulin (n = 41) or mealtime insulin aspart (n = 37) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were served standard diabetic meals for breakfast (8:00 hours) and lunch (12:00 hours) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were collected at 7:40 hours (fasting), 9:30, 11:30, 13:30 and 15:30 hours and analysed for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, activated factor VII (FVIIa), D-dimer, prothrombin fragment 1+2 (F1+2), tissue plasminogen activator antigen (t-PA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor activity (PAI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> response differed significantly between insulin regimens with a postprandial increase on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin and a decrease on insulin aspart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a significant postprandial decrease in F1+2, PAI and t-PA, and no changes in FVIIa and D-dimer, on both insulin regimens, but with no differences between insulin treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The rapid-acting insulin analogue aspart and the intermediate-acting insulin <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> had similar postprandial effects on markers of coagulation activation and fibrinolysis despite different effects on postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> response </plain></SENT>
