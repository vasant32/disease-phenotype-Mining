<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used data from the Prevention of Renal and Vascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0679247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">End Stage Disease</z:e> (PREVEND) study, an ongoing, community-based, prospective cohort study initiated in 1997 in the Netherlands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The initial cohort consisted of 8,592 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 4 years, 6,894 subjects participated in a follow-up survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at baseline or missing data on fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> were excluded, leaving 5,654 subjects for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, defined as a fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &gt; or = 7.0 mmol/l and/or the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> medication, was used as the outcome measure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>UAE was calculated as the mean UAE from two consecutive 24-h urine collections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression models were used, with the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> as the dependent variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 5,654 subjects for whom data were analyzed, 185 (3.3%) developed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during a mean follow-up period of 4.2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>UAE, CRP, and the presence of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> at baseline were significantly associated with the incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P &lt; 0.001 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> variables) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In a univariate model, the odds ratio (OR) for UAE was 1.59 (95% CI 1.42-1.79) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In our full model, adjusted for age, sex, number of criteria of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e>, and other known risk factors for the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (including fasting insulin), the association between UAE and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> remained significant (OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.25-1.88, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was a significant interaction between UAE and CRP (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>After CRP was stratified into tertiles, the ORs for the association between baseline UAE and the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were 2.2 (1.47-3.3), 1.33 (0.96-1.84), and 1.04 (0.83-1.31) for the lowest to highest tertiles, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: UAE predicts type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> independent of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> and other known risk markers of development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The predictive value of UAE was modified by the level of CRP </plain></SENT>
