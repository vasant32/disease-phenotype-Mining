<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a retrospective case-control study of patients (n = 89) matched for age and body mass index with non-surgical controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cases had a longer duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (99 ± 53 and 80 ± 59 months, p &lt; 0.05) and a lower HbA1c than controls (7.9 ± 1.6 vs. 8.5 ± 1.9%, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At follow-up (median 105 weeks) cases had lost 16.8 ± 13.5 kg and controls 1.7 ± 8.9 kg (p &lt; 0.001) and HbA1c decreased by 0.6-0.8% (p &lt; 0.001 for time) with no difference between cases and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> resolution, defined by HbA1c less than 6.5% and taking no medications, occurred in 14 (16%) cases and 2 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This is in contrast to published outcomes of resolution of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after bariatric surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that there is a clear need for randomized studies of the effect of gastric banding in patients with long-standing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
