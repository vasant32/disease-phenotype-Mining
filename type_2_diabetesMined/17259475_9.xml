<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: International guidelines recommend optimal control of risk factors in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> to prevent cardiovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined risk associations between achieving treatment targets for glycemia, blood pressure and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> control, and other risk factors on subsequent cardiovascular events in Chinese patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Between 1995 and 2005, 6,386 Chinese type 2 diabetic patients without a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> (CHD) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were classified according to the number of treatment targets attained at baseline, and their cardiovascular outcomes were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment targets were defined as A1C &lt;7.0%, blood pressure &lt;130/80 mmHg, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> &lt;2.6 mmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 5.7 years, cumulative incidence of CHD or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (n = 749) increased with decreasing numbers of treatment targets attained at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Attainment of two or more targets at baseline was associated with reduced risk of CHD compared with those with no target achieved (hazard ratio 0.69 [95% CI 0.50-0.94], P = 0.020) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the association lost its significance after adjustment for urinary albumin-to-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Reaching more treatment targets was associated with reduced risk of new <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of CHD in Chinese patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
