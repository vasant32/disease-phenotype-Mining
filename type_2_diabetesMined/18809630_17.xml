<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To better identify women at risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> we examined sociodemographic correlates and changes in the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> births between 1995 and 2005 in Australia's largest state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A computerized database of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> births (n = 956,738) between 1995 and 2005 in New South Wales, Australia, was used in a multivariate logistic regression that examined the association between sociodemographic characteristics and the occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between 1995 and 2005, the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> increased by 45%, from 3.0 to 4.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Women born in South Asia had the highest adjusted odds ratio (OR) of any region (4.33 [95% CI 4.12-4.55]) relative to women born in Australia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Women living in the three lowest socioeconomic quartiles had higher adjusted ORs for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> relative to women in the highest quartile (1.54 [1.50-1.59], 1.74 [1.69-1.8], and 1.65 [1.60-1.70] for decreasing socioeconomic status quartiles) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increasing age was strongly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e>, with women aged &gt;40 years having an adjusted OR of 6.13 (95% CI 5.79-6.49) relative to women in their early 20s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Parity was associated with a small reduced risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no association between smoking and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Maternal age, socioeconomic position, and ethnicity are important correlates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Future culturally specific interventions should target prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> in these high-risk groups </plain></SENT>
