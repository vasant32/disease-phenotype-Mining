<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By immunohistochemical methods, using antisera to a synthetic undecapeptide of IAPP and to insulin, we show that freshly fixed islet B cells in man, guinea pig, rat, mouse and hamster exhibit strong IAPP-immunoreactivity while A cells are unreactive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In human autopsy material, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of 11 non-diabetic individuals had IAPP immunoreactivity of the islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In comparison 8 of the 13 patients with Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had no IAPP immunoreactive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proportion of islet cells having IAPP immunoreactivity exceeded 10% in only 1 of the 5 remaining diabetic patients while in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 13 patients substantially more than 10% of the islet cells contained immunoreactive insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IAPP-positive amyloid deposits were found in 20-99% of the islets in 12 of the Type 2 diabetic patients while 6 of 11 non-diabetic subjects had amyloid in 3-11% of their islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In islets with IAPP-immunoreactive amyloid, very few IAPP-cells were seen despite a strong reaction of the B cells with antiserum to insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study shows that IAPP is a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> islet B cell component and that IAPP immunoreactivity in B cells is diminished in Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> while IAPP is deposited as amyloid fibrils in the islets of Langerhans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although the function of IAPP is unknown, its occurrence in the islet B cells and its structural relation to calcitonin gene-related <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> makes a hormonal nature probable.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
