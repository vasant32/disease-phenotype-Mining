<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Given the emerging role of signal transduction in these syndromes, we set out to explore the possible role that G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2), first identified as a G protein-coupled receptor regulator, could have as a modulator of insulin responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed the influence of GRK2 levels in insulin signaling in myoblasts and adipocytes with experimentally increased or silenced levels of GRK2, as well as in GRK2 hemizygous animals expressing 50% lower levels of this kinase in three different models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-α (TNF-α) infusion, aging, and high-fat diet (HFD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> transport, whole-body <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin tolerance, the activation status of insulin pathway components, and the circulating levels of important mediators were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and adipocyte size with age and HFD was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Altering GRK2 levels markedly modifies insulin-mediated signaling in cultured adipocytes and myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>GRK2 levels are increased by ∼2-fold in muscle and adipose tissue in the animal models tested, as well as in lymphocytes from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, hemizygous GRK2 mice show enhanced insulin sensitivity and do not develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> by TNF-α, aging, or HFD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, reduced GRK2 levels induce a lean phenotype and decrease age-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our data identify GRK2 as an important negative regulator of insulin effects, key to the etiopathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, which uncovers this protein as a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of these disorders </plain></SENT>
