<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The study examines <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> attitude differences by treatment modality (insulin vs. no insulin), race/ethnicity, and the interaction of these two variables for people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data were collected with the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Care Profile (DCP), an instrument that assesses psychosocial factors related to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants (n = 672) were recruited in the metropolitan Detroit, Michigan, area from 1993 to 1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 68% of these participants were African-Americans with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and 32% were Caucasians with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analyses of covariance were performed to examine the effects of race/ethnicity, treatment, and their interaction for each DCP scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The four patient categories (two ethnicities by two treatment modalities) differed by age, years with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, education, and sex distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment modality had a significant effect on 6 of the 16 DCP scales (Control, Social and Personal Factors, Positive Attitude, Negative Attitude, Self-Care Ability, and Exercise Barriers) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ethnicity was a significant effect for three scales (Control, Support, and Support Attitudes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The interaction of race/ethnicity and treatment modality was a significant effect for two related attitude scales (Positive Attitude and Negative Attitude) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that attitudes toward <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are similar for African-American and Caucasian patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results also suggest that treatment modality has a greater effect on attitudes than either race/ethnicity or the interaction effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, Caucasian patients using insulin differed from the other patient groups by having the least positive and the most negative attitudes regarding <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
