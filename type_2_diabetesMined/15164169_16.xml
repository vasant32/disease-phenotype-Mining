<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The STOP-<z:mp ids='MP_0002057'>NIDDM</z:mp> Trial has shown that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> treatment in subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> is associated with a significant risk reduction in the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and cardiovascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Kaiser and Sawicki have accused the investigators of the STOP-<z:mp ids='MP_0002057'>NIDDM</z:mp> Trial of major biases in the conduct of the study, of manipulating the data and of conflict of interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this paper is to present data and explanations refuting these allegations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the STOP-<z:mp ids='MP_0002057'>NIDDM</z:mp> Trial, 61 subjects were excluded from the efficacy analysis before unblinding for legitimate reasons: failure to satisfy major entry criteria (n=17) and lack of post-randomisation data (n=44) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blinding and randomisation were carried out by an independent biostatistician </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Titration of placebo/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> is well described in the protocol and in the study design paper </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the study population, 9.3% had a fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> of &gt; or =7.0 mmol/l at screening and could have been diabetic according to the new diagnostic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, even if these subjects are excluded, patients having <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> treatment still saw a significant risk reduction in the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (p=0.0027) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The changes in weight are consistent in different publications and are related to different times of follow-up and assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Weight change does have an effect on the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> treatment is still effective even after adjusting for this (p=0.0063) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The cardiovascular endpoints were a clearly designated assessment in the original protocol, and only those defined in the protocol and ascertained by the independent Cardiovascular Event Adjudication Committee were used in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> was defined according to the most recent diagnostic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The STOP-<z:mp ids='MP_0002057'>NIDDM</z:mp> Trial results are scientifically sound and credible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The investigators stand strongly behind these results demonstrating that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> treatment is associated with a delay in the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and cardiovascular complications in a high-risk population with IGT </plain></SENT>
