<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intrauterine <z:hpo ids='HP_0004395'>malnutrition</z:hpo> in form of an isocaloric low-protein diet given to female rats throughout gestation decreases islet-cell proliferation, islet size and pancreatic insulin content, while increasing the apoptotic rate and sensitivity to <z:chebi fb="41" ids="35196">nitrogen oxide</z:chebi> and interleukin-1beta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hence, the influence of a low-protein diet on the development of beta-cells and islets could also be of interest for the pathogenesis of Type 1 and Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesise that the effects of a low-protein diet in utero are caused by intrauterine programming of beta-cell gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Pregnant Wistar rats were fed a low-protein diet (8% protein) or a control diet (20% protein) throughout gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At day 21.5 of gestation fetal pancreata were removed, digested and cultured for 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neoformed islets were collected and analysed by proteome analysis comprising 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 2810 different protein spots were identified, 70 of which were changed due to the low-protein diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>From 45 of the changed protein spots, identification was obtained by mass spectrometry (64% success rate) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Proteins induced by the low-protein diet were grouped according to their biological functions, e.g. cell cycle and differentiation, protein synthesis and chaperoning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our study offers a possible explanation of the alterations induced by a low-protein diet in islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It shows that in Wistar rats the intrauterine milieu could program islet gene expression in ways unfavourable for the future of the progeny </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This could be important for our understanding of the development of Type 1 and Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
