<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effectiveness of treatment with oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs depends largely on patient compliance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of the DIACOM (effect of DosIng frequency of oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">Antidiabetic</z:chebi> agents on the COMpliance and biochemical control of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) study was to compare the compliance of patients treated with once-daily (od) or twice-daily (bid) sulphonylureas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and five patients, previously treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi>, were randomized to receive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi> in modified-release formulation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) once daily or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> twice daily for 16 weeks, using an electronic monitoring system (MEMS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significant difference in compliance was observed between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall compliance was 93.5+/-14.0% in the once-daily <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> group and 87.2+/-21.1% in the twice-daily <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> group (p&lt;0.05), and the correct number of doses was taken on 86.3+/-15.4 and 66.9+/-29.0% of treatment days respectively (p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The percentage of missed doses was 9.3+/-12.5% in the once-daily group and 17.5+/-18.0% in the twice-daily group (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The percentage of doses taken in the correct time window and correct inter-dose interval was higher in the once-daily group, as was therapeutic coverage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> group also achieved significantly better glycaemic control [fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA(1c))] than those treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> (p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates that patient compliance with once-daily <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> is significantly better than with twice-daily <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Consistently better efficacy was observed for short-term (fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>) and long-term glycaemic control (HbA(1c)) in the once-daily group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate the possible therapeutic advantages of once-daily agents over twice-daily agents in the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
