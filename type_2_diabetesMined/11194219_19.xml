<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The original 60-item DKQ was administered to 502 adult Mexican-Americans with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who are part of the Starr County <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Education Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The sample was composed of 252 participants and 250 support partners </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The subjects were randomly assigned to the educational and social support intervention (n = 250) or to the wait-listed control group (n = 252) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A shortened 24-item version of the DKQ was derived from the original instrument after data collection was completed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reliability was assessed by means of Cronbach's coefficient alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To determine validity, differentiation between the experimental and control groups was conducted at baseline and after the educational portion of the intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 24-item version of the DKQ (DKQ-24) attained a reliability coefficient of 0.78, indicating internal consistency, and showed sensitivity to the intervention, suggesting construct validation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The DKQ-24 is a reliable and valid measure of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related knowledge that is relatively easy to administer to either English or Spanish speakers </plain></SENT>
