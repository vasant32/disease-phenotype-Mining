<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a nested case-control study conducted among 608 women with newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 559 control subjects in the Nurses' Health Study, we measured the association between baseline plasma 25-OHD concentration and risk of incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After adjusting for matching factors and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk factors, including BMI, higher levels of plasma 25-OHD were associated with a lower risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio for incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the top (median 25-OHD, 33.4 ng/ml) versus the bottom (median 25-OHD, 14.4 ng/ml) quartile was 0.52 (95% CI 0.33-0.83) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The associations were consistent across subgroups of baseline BMI, age, and calcium intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Plasma 25-OHD concentration was associated with lower risk of incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in women </plain></SENT>
