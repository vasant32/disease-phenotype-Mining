<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On an aggregate level, gene-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> interactions are expected to result in different heritability estimates at different <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, this hypothesis has never been tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The present study included 2,180 British female twins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BMI was used as an index of general <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Outcome measures were insulin sensitivity (indexed by quantitative insulin-sensitivity check index [QUICKI]) and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Structural equation modelling was used to test whether BMI interacted with latent genetic and environmental effects to impact on the outcome measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Genetic influences on triacylglycerol increased with BMI (p &lt; 0.001) whereas the unique environmental influence on QUICKI decreased with BMI (p &lt; 0.001), resulting in a higher heritability estimate for both measures at higher BMI levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This was further illustrated by stratified analysis in twin pairs concordant for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> weight and twin pairs concordant for overweight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Heritability was 19 percentage points higher for triacylglycerol (p &lt; 0.001) and 31 percentage points higher for QUICKI (p &lt; 0.01) among twins concordant for overweight than among twins concordant for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>BMI had no moderator effect on the latent genetic and environmental factors for total cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that the expression of genes influencing triacylglycerol and insulin sensitivity can vary as a function of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The substantial increases in the genetic contribution to the total variance in insulin sensitivity and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triacylglycerols</z:chebi> at higher BMIs may prove extremely valuable in the search for candidate genes </plain></SENT>
