<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the global prevalence and major risk factors for diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (DR) and vision-threatening diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (VTDR) among people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A pooled analysis using individual participant data from population-based studies around the world was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A systematic literature review was conducted to identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> population-based studies in general populations or individuals with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who had ascertained DR from <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> photographs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Studies provided data for DR end points, including any DR, proliferative DR, diabetic macular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, and VTDR, and also major systemic risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pooled prevalence estimates were directly age-standardized to the 2010 World <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Population aged 20-79 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 35 studies (1980-2008) provided data from 22,896 individuals with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall prevalence was 34.6% (95% CI 34.5-34.8) for any DR, 6.96% (6.87-7.04) for proliferative DR, 6.81% (6.74-6.89) for diabetic macular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, and 10.2% (10.1-10.3) for VTDR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> DR prevalence end points increased with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c), and blood pressure levels and were higher in people with type 1 compared with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There are approximately 93 million people with DR, 17 million with proliferative DR, 21 million with diabetic macular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, and 28 million with VTDR worldwide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Longer <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration and poorer glycemic and blood pressure control are strongly associated with DR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data highlight the substantial worldwide public health burden of DR and the importance of modifiable risk factors in its occurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study is limited by data pooled from studies at different time points, with different methodologies and population characteristics </plain></SENT>
