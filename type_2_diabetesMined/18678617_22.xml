<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Fatty acid-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> uncoupling and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> have been proposed to reduce cardiac efficiency and contribute to cardiac dysfunction in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> uncoupling may also contribute to reduced cardiac efficiency and contractile dysfunction in the type 1 diabetic Akita mouse model (Akita) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Cardiac function and substrate utilization were determined in isolated working hearts and in vivo function by echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>Mitochondrial</z:hpo> function and coupling were determined in saponin-permeabilized fibers, and proton leak kinetics was determined in isolated mitochondria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">Hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> production and aconitase activity were measured in isolated mitochondria, and total reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured in heart homogenates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Resting cardiac function was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in Akita mice, and myocardial insulin sensitivity was preserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although Akita hearts oxidized more fatty acids, myocardial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi> consumption was not increased, and cardiac efficiency was not reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-stimulated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> oxygen consumption and ATP synthesis were decreased, and mitochondria showed grossly abnormal <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> in Akita </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, and despite a twofold increase in uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3) content, ATP-to-O ratios and proton leak kinetics were unchanged, even after perfusion of Akita hearts with 1 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Insulin-deficient Akita hearts do not exhibit fatty acid-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> uncoupling, indicating important differences in the basis for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction between insulin-responsive type 1 versus insulin-resistant type 2 diabetic hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Increased UCP3 levels do not automatically increase <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> uncoupling in the heart, which supports the hypothesis that fatty acid-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> uncoupling as exists in type 2 diabetic hearts requires a concomitant increase in ROS generation </plain></SENT>
