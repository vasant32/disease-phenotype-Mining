<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We recently reported evidence of a novel type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> locus placed on chromosome 12q15 between markers D12S375 and D12S1684 (<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> 48:2246-2251, 1999) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four multigenerational families having logarithm of odds (LOD) scores &gt;1.0 in the original analysis were genotyped for 11 additional markers in this interval to refine this mapping; this allowed us to narrow the linked region to the interval between markers D12S1693 and D12S326 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a multipoint parametric analysis using the VITESSE software, the LOD score for linkage at this location reached 3.1 in one of these families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This interval contains the gene for protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type R (PTPRR)--a protein that may be involved in both insulin secretion and action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After determining PTPRR exon-intron structure, we identified several polymorphisms in this gene but no mutation segregating with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The search for mutations was also negative for carboxypeptidase M (CPM)--another candidate gene mapped to this region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In summary, our data provide further evidence for the existence of a type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> locus on chromosome 12q15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This locus, however, does not appear to correspond to the PTPRR or CPM, although a contribution of mutations in regulatory regions cannot be excluded at this time </plain></SENT>
