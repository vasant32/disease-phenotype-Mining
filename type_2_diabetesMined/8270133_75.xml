<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the extent to which the above-mentioned factors could contribute to the excessive cardiovascular mortality observed in diabetic patients was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the years 1979-1981, altogether 133 (70 men, 63 women) newly-diagnosed patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 144 (62 men, 82 women) non-diabetic control subjects aged 45-64 years were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both groups were re-examined in the years 1985-1986 and 1991-1992 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The impact of different factors on cardiovascular mortality was examined by univariate analyses after adjustment for age and sex and by multiple logistic regression analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The age-standardized total and cardiovascular mortality rates were substantially higher in diabetic men (17.8 and 15.0%, total and cardiovascular mortality, respectively p = 0.06 and NS) and women (18.5 and 16.6%, p &lt; 0.01 for both) than in non-diabetic control men (5.2% both total and cardiovascular mortality) and women (4.2 and 2.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular mortality was not related to the treatment modality (diet, oral drugs, insulin) at 5 years from diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Use of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretics</z:chebi>, beta-blocking agents or their combination at baseline did not make a significant contribution to cardiovascular mortality either </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In multiple logistic regression analysis on diabetic patients, age, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, smoking, blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and ischaemic ECG at baseline had independent associations with cardiovascular mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, urinary albumin excretion rate measured at 5-year examination also predicted 10-year cardiovascular mortality after adjustment for the effects of major risk factors including <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> abnormalities, but its predictive power reduced to a nonsignificant level when the effect of plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was taken into account </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The relative risk of cardiovascular mortality associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 8.2 after allowing for age alone, but it declined to 3.7 when <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> contributing factors from the baseline examination (except blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>) were taken into account </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the present results indicate that <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> and/or other changes in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> composition characteristic of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and manifesting as elevated serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> are atherogenic and they strongly predict increased cardiovascular mortality.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
