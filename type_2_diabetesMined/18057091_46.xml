<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Defects in glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> 1 (GLP-1) secretion have been reported in some patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after meal ingestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="?"><plain>We addressed the following questions: 1) Is the quantitative impairment in GLP-1 levels different after mixed meal or isolated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> ingestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="?"><plain>2) Which endogenous factors are associated with the concentrations of GLP-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="?"><plain>In particular, do elevated fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> or glucagon levels diminish GLP-1 responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Seventeen patients with mild type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 17 subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo>, and 14 matched control subjects participated in an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (75 g) and a mixed meal challenge (820 kcal), both carried out over 240 min on separate occasions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma levels of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, glucagon, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, free fatty acids (FFAs), gastric inhibitory <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (GIP), and GLP-1 were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: GIP and GLP-1 levels increased significantly in both experiments (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the initial GIP response was exaggerated compared with control subjects after mixed meal (P &lt; 0.001) but not after oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> ingestion (P = 0.98) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>GLP-1 levels were similar in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three groups in both experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>GIP responses were 186 +/- 17% higher after mixed meal ingestion than after the oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> load (P &lt; 0.0001), whereas GLP-1 levels were similar in both experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was a strong negative association between fasting glucagon and integrated FFA levels and subsequent GLP-1 concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast, fasting FFA and integrated glucagon levels after <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> or meal ingestion and female sex were positively related to GLP-1 concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Incretin levels were unrelated to measures of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control or insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Deteriorations in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis can develop in the absence of any impairment in GIP or GLP-1 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the defects in GLP-1 concentrations previously described in patients with long-standing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are likely secondary to other hormonal and metabolic alterations, such as hyperglucagonemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>GIP and GLP-1 concentrations appear to be regulated by different factors and are independent of each other </plain></SENT>
