<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: A small percentage of patients do not develop any evidence of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (DR) even after many years of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been implicated in the development of DR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we sought to determine if the regulation of VEGF differs in those patients who develop DR after many years of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with those who do not develop DR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed standard 7-field stereoscopic fundus photography on 95 consecutive patients with type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were categorized into 3 groups according to the presence or absence of DR and the duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>: group 1 was defined by presence of DR, group 2 was defined by absence of DR after &gt;10 years duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and group 3 was defined by absence of DR with long-standing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (&gt; or =20 years for type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and &gt; or =15 years for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Monocytes from 40 ml peripheral blood were isolated from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, and the hypoxic induction of VEGF was determined in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found no significant difference in the basal level of VEGF in patients with and without DR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, we did find a markedly significant difference in the hypoxic induction of VEGF between patients from group 1 and group 3 (4.35+/-0.55 vs. 1.87+/-0.3, P&lt;0.00013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that 1 mechanism for the absence of DR in patients with long-standing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is a decreased hypoxic induction of VEGF </plain></SENT>
