<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective was to determine the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety and tolerability of GPR119 <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, JNJ-38431055 in T2DM subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo- and positive-controled, single-dose cross-over study and a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controled multiple-dose parallel design study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study was conducted at 4 US research centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two different experiments involving 25 and 32 different subjects were performed in male and female subjects, aged 25-60 years, mean body mass index between 22 and 39.9 kg/m2 who had T2DM diagnosed 6 months to 10 years before screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>JNJ-38431055 (100 and 500 mg) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> (100 mg) as a single-dose or JNJ-38431055 (500 mg) once daily for 14 consecutive days were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Effects on stimulated plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> and incretin concentrations were pre-specified outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: JNJ-38431055 was well tolerated and not associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Plasma systemic exposure of JNJ-38431055 increased as the dose increased, was approximately two-fold greater after multiple-dose administration, and attained steady-state after approximately 8 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with placebo, single-dose administration of oral JNJ-38431055 decreased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excursion during an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test, but multiple-dose administration did not alter 24-h weighted mean <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multiple dosing of JNJ-38431055 increased post-meal total glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> 1 and gastric insulinotropic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> concentrations compared to baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These studies provide evidence of limited <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> lowering and incretin activity for JNJ-38431055 in subjects with T2DM </plain></SENT>
