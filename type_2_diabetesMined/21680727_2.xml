<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Diabetic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0857175" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">postinfarction</z:e> patients are at increased mortality risk compared with nondiabetic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0857175" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">postinfarction</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a substantial number of these patients, diabetic cardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> already preexists at the time of the infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the current study we investigated if markers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002459'>autonomic dysfunction</z:hpo> can further discriminate diabetic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0857175" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">postinfarction</z:e> patients into low- and high-risk groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 481 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who survived <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI), were aged ≤ 80 years, and presented in sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Primary end point was total mortality at 5 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393911" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autonomic failure</z:e> (SAF) was defined as coincidence of abnormal autonomic reflex function (assessed by means of heart rate turbulence) and of abnormal autonomic tonic activity (assessed by means of deceleration capacity of heart rate) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariable risk analyses considered SAF and standard risk predictors including history of previous MI, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> on Holter monitoring, insulin treatment, and impaired left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During follow-up, 83 of the 481 patients (17.3%) died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of these, 24 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac deaths</z:hpo> and 21 nonsudden cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SAF identified a high-risk group of 58 patients with a 5-year mortality rate of 64.0% at a sensitivity level of 38.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multivariately, SAF was the strongest predictor of mortality (hazard ratio 4.9 [95% CI 2.4-9.9]), followed by age ≥65 years (3.4 [1.9-5.8]), and LVEF ≤ 30% (2.6 [1.5-4.4]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Combined abnormalities of autonomic reflex function and autonomic tonic activity identifies diabetic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0857175" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">postinfarction</z:e> patients with very poor prognoses </plain></SENT>
