<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In diabetic men, the LPL activity of adipose tissue was significantly reduced when expressed per tissue weight or per fat cell (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diabetic females had slightly but not significantly lower LPL activity in adipose tissue than the non-diabetic females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The muscle LPL activity was similar in diabetic and non-diabetic subjects of both sexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When the diabetic men were classified according to fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, the patients with high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels had lower adipose tissue LPL activity than those with moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In both diabetic and non-diabetic subjects, there was a significant positive correlation between <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> concentrations and adipose tissue LPL activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> influences adipose tissue LPL activity and plasma <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> concentrations and that this effect is superimposed on the similar changes produced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> alone </plain></SENT>
