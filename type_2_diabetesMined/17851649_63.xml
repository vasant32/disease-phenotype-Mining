<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the association between maternal <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> and tHcy status during pregnancy, and offspring <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> at 6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In the Pune Maternal Nutrition Study we studied 700 consecutive eligible pregnant women in six villages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We measured maternal nutritional intake and circulating concentrations of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi>, tHcy and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30860">methylmalonic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34840">MMA</z:chebi>) at 18 and 28 weeks of gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These were correlated with offspring anthropometry, body composition (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (homeostatic model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> [HOMA-R]) at 6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two-thirds of mothers had low <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi> (&lt;150 pmol/l), 90% had high <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34840">MMA</z:chebi> (&gt;0.26 micromol/l) and 30% had raised tHcy concentrations (&gt;10 micromol/l); only one had a low erythrocyte <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although short and thin (BMI), the 6-year-old children were relatively adipose compared with the UK standards (skinfold thicknesses) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Higher maternal erythrocyte <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> concentrations at 28 weeks predicted higher offspring <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> and higher HOMA-R (both p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Low maternal <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi> (18 weeks; p = 0.03) predicted higher HOMA-R in the children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The offspring of mothers with a combination of high <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> and low <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi> concentrations were the most insulin resistant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Low maternal <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi> and high <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> status may contribute to the epidemic of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in India </plain></SENT>
