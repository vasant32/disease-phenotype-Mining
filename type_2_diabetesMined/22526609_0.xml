<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, plasma copeptin, the stable C-terminal portion of the precursor of vasopressin, has strong potential as a biomarker for the cardiometabolic syndrome and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous results were contradictory, which may be explained by differences between men and women in responsiveness of the vasopressin system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of copeptin for prediction of future type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in men and women separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From the Prevention of Renal and Vascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0679247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Endstage Disease</z:e> (PREVEND) study, 4,063 women and 3,909 men without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at baseline were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 208 women and 288 men developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during a median follow-up of 7.7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In multivariable-adjusted models, we observed a stronger association of copeptin with risk of future <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in women (OR 1.49 [95% CI 1.24, 1.79]) than in men (OR 1.01 [95% CI 0.85, 1.19]) (p (interaction) &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The addition of copeptin to the Data from the Epidemiological Study on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin Resistance</z:hpo> Syndrome (DESIR) clinical model improved the discriminative value (C-statistic,+0.007, p = 0.02) and reclassification (integrated discrimination improvement [IDI] = 0.004, p &lt; 0.01) in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, we observed no improvement in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The additive value of copeptin in women was maintained when other independent predictors, such as <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and 24 h urinary albumin excretion (UAE), were included in the model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The association of plasma copeptin with the risk of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was stronger in women than in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Plasma copeptin alone, and along with existing biomarkers (<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, hs-CRP and UAE), significantly improved the risk prediction for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in women </plain></SENT>
