<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Amish Family <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study was initiated to identify susceptibility genes for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This article describes the genetic epidemiology of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and related traits in this unique population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study cohort comprised Amish probands with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were diagnosed between 35 and 65 years of age and their extended adult family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We recruited 953 adults who represented 45 multigenerational families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Phenotypic characterization included anthropometry, blood pressure, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> status, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile, and leptin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age of study participants was 46 years, and the mean BMI was 26.9 kg/m2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were older, more <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, and had higher insulin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the OOA was approximately half that of the Caucasian individuals who participated in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (95% CI 0.23-0.84) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the siblings of the diabetic probands was 26.5% compared with a prevalence of 7.0% in spouses (lambdaS = 3.28, 95% CI 1.58-6.80) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The heritability of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related quantitative traits was substantial (13-70% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-related traits, 10-42% for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, and 11-24% for insulin levels during the oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test; P = 0.01 to &lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the Amish has similar phenotypic features to that of the overall Caucasian population, although the prevalence in the Amish community is lower than that of the Caucasian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There is significant familial clustering of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and related traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This unique family collection will be an excellent resource for investigating the genetic underpinnings of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
