<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> 1 (GLP-1) is potentially a very attractive agent for treating type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We explored the effect of short-term (1 week) treatment with a GLP-1 derivative, liraglutide (NN2211), on 24-h dynamics in glycemia and circulating free fatty acids, islet cell hormone profiles, and gastric emptying during meals using acetaminophen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, fasting endogenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> release and gluconeogenesis (3-(3)H-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion and (2)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15377">H(2)O</z:chebi> ingestion, respectively) were determined, and aspects of pancreatic islet cell function were elucidated on the subsequent day using homeostasis model assessment and first- and second-phase insulin response during a hyperglycemic clamp (plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> approximately 16 mmol/l), and, finally, on top of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, an arginine stimulation test was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For accomplishing this, 13 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were examined in a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Liraglutide (6 micro g/kg) was administered subcutaneously once daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Liraglutide significantly reduced the 24-h area under the curve for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (P = 0.01) and glucagon (P = 0.04), whereas the area under the curve for circulating free fatty acids was unaltered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four-hour insulin secretion rates as assessed by deconvolution of serum C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> concentrations were unchanged, indicating a relative increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Gastric emptying was not influenced at the dose of liraglutide used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fasting endogenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> release was decreased (P = 0.04) as a result of a reduced glycogenolysis (P = 0.01), whereas gluconeogenesis was unaltered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>First-phase insulin response and the insulin response to an arginine stimulation test with the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> were markedly increased (P &lt; 0.001), whereas the proinsulin/insulin ratio fell (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The disposition index (peak insulin concentration after intravenous bolus of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> multiplied by insulin sensitivity as assessed by homeostasis model assessment) almost doubled during liraglutide treatment (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Both during <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> per se and after arginine exposure, the glucagon responses were reduced during liraglutide administration (P &lt; 0.01 and P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, 1 week's treatment with a single daily dose of the GLP-1 derivative liraglutide, operating through several different mechanisms including an ameliorated pancreatic islet cell function in individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, improves glycemic control throughout 24 h of daily living, i.e., prandial and nocturnal periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This study further emphasizes GLP-1 and its derivatives as a promising novel concept for treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
