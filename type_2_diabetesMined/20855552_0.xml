<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 173 seventh graders (46% male and 54% female; 49% Hispanic and 51% African American) with BMI ≥85th percentile and a family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were assessed with weight, height, BMI, percent body fat, and waist circumference measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Laboratory indexes included 2-h oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests with insulin levels at 0 and 2 h, fasting A1C, and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo> was estimated by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Youth also completed questionnaires evaluating health behaviors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Average BMI (31.6 ± 6.4 kg/m²) and percent body fat (39.5 ± 10.6%) were high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants demonstrated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> with elevated HOMA-IR values (8.5 ± 5.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with African American youth, Hispanic youth had higher <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> and lower <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> despite similar BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hispanic youth reported lower self-efficacy for diet, less physical activity, and higher total fat intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Male youth had higher <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (0 and 2 h) and reported more physical activity, more healthy food choices, and higher calcium intake than female youth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Screening high-risk youth for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> abnormalities is recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Promoting acceptable physical activities and healthy food choices may be especially important for Hispanic and female youth </plain></SENT>
