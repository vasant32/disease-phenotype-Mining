<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PTEN (MMAC1) is a <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>/protein phosphatase that can negatively regulate the PI3K pathway by dephosphorylating phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi>, but it is unclear whether PTEN is physiologically relevant to insulin signaling in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We employed an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) strategy in an effort to specifically inhibit the expression of PTEN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transfection of cells in culture with ASO targeting PTEN reduced PTEN <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels and increased insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation in alpha-mouse liver-12 (AML12) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Systemic administration of PTEN ASO once a week in mice suppressed PTEN <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression in liver and fat by up to 90 and 75%, respectively, and normalized blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations in db/db and ob/ob mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of PTEN expression also dramatically reduced insulin concentrations in ob/ob mice, improved the performance of db/db mice during insulin tolerance tests, and increased Akt phosphorylation in liver in response to insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that PTEN plays a significant role in regulating <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in vivo by negatively regulating insulin signaling </plain></SENT>
