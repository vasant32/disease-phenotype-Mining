<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eleven thousand one hundred and forty participants in the ADVANCE trial were randomly assigned to an intensive [aiming for a <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA1c) â‰¤6.5%] or a standard blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-control strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Weight was measured at baseline and every 6 months over a median follow-up of 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariable linear regression and linear-mixed effect models were used to examine predictors of weight change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean difference in weight between the intensive and standard <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-control arm during follow-up was 0.75 kg (95% CI: 0.56-0.94), p-value &lt;0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean weight decreased by 0.70 kg (95% CI: 0.53-0.87), p &lt; 0.001 by the end of follow-up in the standard arm but remained stable in the intensive arm, with a non-significant gain of 0.16 kg (95% CI: -0.02 to 0.34), p = 0.075 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Baseline factors associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> were younger age, higher HbA1c, Caucasian ethnicity and number of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment combinations including insulin [3.22 kg (95% CI: 2.92-3.52)] and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> [3.06 kg (95% CI: 2.69-3.43)] were associated with the greatest <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> while treatment combinations including sulphonylureas were associated with less <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> [0.71 kg (95%CI: 0.39-1.03)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intensive <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-control regimens are not necessarily associated with substantial <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patient characteristic associated with weight change were age, ethnicity, smoking and HbA1c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The main treatment strategies predicting <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> were the use of insulin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
