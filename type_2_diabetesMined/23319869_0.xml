<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The first dipeptidyl-peptidase-IV (DPP-4) inhibitor for the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> became available in 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since then, the number of DPP-4 inhibitors has increased and DPP-4 inhibitors have developed into an important drug class </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DPP-4 inhibitors act by increasing endogenous GLP-1 and GIP concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Via this mechanism, insulin secretion is <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependently stimulated and glucagon secretion inhibited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This results in a low risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, DPP-4 inhibitors are weight-neutral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Linagliptin is a novel DPP-4 inhibitor that, in contrast to the other members of this drug class, is eliminated by a biliary/hepatic route rather than by renal elimination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This property allows the use of linagliptin in type 2 diabetic patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> kidney function as well as in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal insufficiency</z:hpo> without dose adjustments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In comparative clinical studies, linagliptin was noninferior to other established <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> agents, especially to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It showed a superior safety profile over <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> regarding <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>, a composite cardiovascular endpoint, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This review gives an overview on the efficacy and safety of linagliptin in comparison to the classical oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs as well as to the other DPP-4 inhibitors </plain></SENT>
