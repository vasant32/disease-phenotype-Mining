<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to characterize the determinants of enhanced <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization in adipose tissue during catch-up fat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: White adipose tissue morphometry, lipogenic capacity, fatty acid composition, insulin signaling, in vivo <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis, and insulinemic response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> were assessed in a rat model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0267977" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">semistarvation</z:e>-refeeding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This model is characterized by <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> redistribution from skeletal muscle to adipose tissue during catch-up fat that results solely from suppressed thermogenesis (i.e., without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002591'>hyperphagia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Adipose tissue recovery during the dynamic phase of catch-up fat is accompanied by increased adipocyte number with smaller diameter, increased expression of genes for adipogenesis and de novo lipogenesis, increased fatty acid synthase activity, increased proportion of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="26607">saturated fatty acids</z:chebi> in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> (storage) fraction but not in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> (membrane) fraction, and no impairment in insulin signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it is shown that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> and enhanced adipose tissue de novo lipogenesis occur concomitantly and are very early events in catch-up fat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0009126'>increased adipose tissue</z:hpo> insulin stimulation and consequential increase in intracellular <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> flux play an important role in initiating catch-up fat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Once activated, the machinery for lipogenesis and adipogenesis contribute to sustain an increased insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> flux toward fat storage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Such adipose tissue plasticity could play an active role in the thrifty metabolism that underlies <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> redistribution from skeletal muscle to adipose tissue </plain></SENT>
