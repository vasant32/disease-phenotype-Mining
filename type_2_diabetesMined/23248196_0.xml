<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One possible explanation is bias due to differential survival when patients who are at higher risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> survive longer under <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> treatment.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSWe used electronic medical records from 500 general practices in the U.K. and included data from 285,864 men and women aged 50-84 years from January 2000 to December 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We emulated the design and analysis of a hypothetical randomized trial of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi>, estimated the observational analog of the intention-to-treat effect, and adjusted for differential survival bias using inverse-probability weighting.RESULTSDuring 1.2 million person-years of follow-up, there were 13,455 cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 8,932 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">Statin</z:chebi> initiation was associated with increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The hazard ratio (95% CI) of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 1.45 (1.39-1.50) before adjusting for potential confounders and 1.14 (1.10-1.19) after adjustment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adjusting for differential survival did not change the estimates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Initiating <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> was associated with increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>.CONCLUSIONSIn this sample of the general population, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> therapy was associated with 14% increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Differential survival did not explain this increased risk </plain></SENT>
