<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We scanned the Isl-1 gene in 77 Japanese type 2 diabetic patients with a family history and found a heterozygous nonsense mutation (Q310X) in 1 diabetic patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mutation was not found in 180 nondiabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This mutation is located in the putative transactivation domain and deletes 40 amino acids of the COOH-terminal lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Q310X mutant exhibited a 50% reduction in activity compared with the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> when tested for stimulation of transcription of a human amylin promoter-linked luciferase reporter gene in betaTC3 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient was a 49-year-old nonobese man who was diagnosed as having type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at 32 years of age and has been treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mutation was found in his mother, who has type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and in his 14-year-old daughter, who has <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance but a relatively low insulin response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is the first reported finding of Isl-1 gene mutation in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although Isl-1 is not a common predisposing gene for Japanese type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the mutation in this gene may be a rare cause of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in isolated families </plain></SENT>
