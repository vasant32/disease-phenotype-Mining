<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To further expedite <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> research, we generated transgenic C57BL/6 "MIP-TF" mice that have a mouse insulin promoter (MIP) driving the expression of a trifusion (TF) protein of three imaging reporters (luciferase/enhanced green fluorescent protein/HSV1-sr39 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> kinase) in their β-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This should enable the noninvasive imaging of β-cells by charge-coupled device (CCD) and micro-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET), as well as the identification of β-cells at the cellular level by fluorescent microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: MIP-TF mouse β-cells were multimodality imaged in models of type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MIP-TF mouse β-cells were readily identified in pancreatic tissue sections using fluorescent microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We show that MIP-TF β-cells can be noninvasively imaged using microPET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a correlation between CCD and microPET signals from the pancreas region of individual mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After low-dose <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> administration to induce type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we observed a progressive reduction in bioluminescence from the pancreas region before the appearance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although there have been reports of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> inducing proinsulin expression in extrapancreatic tissues, we did not observe bioluminescent signals from extrapancreatic tissues of diabetic MIP-TF mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because MIP-TF mouse β-cells express a <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> kinase, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="465284">ganciclovir</z:chebi> treatment induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, providing a new experimental model of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mice fed a high-fat diet to model early type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> displayed a progressive increase in their pancreatic bioluminescent signals, which were positively correlated with area under the curve-intraperitoneal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (AUC-IPGTT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MIP-TF mice provide a new tool for monitoring β-cells from the single cell level to noninvasive assessments of β-cells in models of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
