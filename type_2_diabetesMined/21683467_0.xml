<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The standard procedure for cross-culture adaptation was used to develop the Chinese version CN-ADDQoL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After the linguistic validation, the validity and reliability of CN-ADDQoL questionnaire were evaluated based on a sample of 697 Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Cronbach's α coefficient, correlation analysis and the structural equation model (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) were applied, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We developed 19 items for the CN-ADDQoL questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The estimated Cronbach's α coefficient was 0.941, indicating an excellent internal consistency of the scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> items had high performance in the structural validity evaluation, with most factor loading values being larger than 0.40 (varied from 0.44 to 0.88) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The Chinese version CN-ADDQoL has maintained its original psychometric properties and achieved adequate reliability and validity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it could be efficiently used to evaluate the current trend of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-management education programs and multinational clinical research trials </plain></SENT>
