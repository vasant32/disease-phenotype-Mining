<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent information suggests that type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0002057'>NIDDM</z:mp>) is associated with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, but other information suggests that there is a hypoinsulinemic state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate the nature of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, 10 newly diagnosed, mildly <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> type 2 diabetics and 11 long-standing type 2 diabetics with secondary failure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Insulin was given by continuous subcutaneous infusion (CSII) for two weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CSII produced near-normoglycemia after 1-4 days in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with modest amounts of insulin (0.5-0.9 U/kg/24 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that whatever <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> prevails in <z:mp ids='MP_0002057'>NIDDM</z:mp>, it does not prevent induction of normoglycemia by insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This suggests that either the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> is a secondary event caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e>, or that <z:mp ids='MP_0002057'>NIDDM</z:mp> patients are hypoinsulinemic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In further studies in vitro, the effect of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> on the rate of glycolytic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization by isolated rat soleus muscle and on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18133">hexose</z:chebi> transport in rat skeletal myocyte line L8 were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the first case, an increase in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration led to a decrease in muscle glycolysis, and in the second case a hyperglycemic concentration of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> led to a marked reduction in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18133">hexose</z:chebi> transport, which was fully reversible within two hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The clinical and in vitro results plus literature data suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> can be overcome by insulin in <z:mp ids='MP_0002057'>NIDDM</z:mp>, and that beta-cell responsiveness to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> is greatly reduced in <z:mp ids='MP_0002057'>NIDDM</z:mp>, but the defect is restricted to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stimulatory phase of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> induction of insulin release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>If this defect can be corrected, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin release will occur so that <z:mp ids='MP_0002057'>NIDDM</z:mp> would be cured notwithstanding the existence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
