<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether a strategy of aggressive cardiovascular risk management reduced the mortality associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206172" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic foot</z:e> ulceration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: After an initial audit of outcomes demonstrating a high mortality rate in 404 diabetic foot <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> patients with the first ulceration developing between 1995 and 1999, a new aggressive cardiovascular risk policy was introduced as standard practice at the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206172" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Diabetic Foot</z:e> Clinic, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, in 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the first 3 years of this policy, 251 patients were screened and identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The audit cycle was then closed by reauditing the 5-year mortality for this second group of foot <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> patients in 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall 5-year mortality was reduced from 48.0% in cohort 1 to 26.8% in cohort 2 (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Improvement in survival was seen for both neuroischemic patients (5-year mortality of 58% reduced to 36%; relative reduction 38%) and neuropathic patients (36% reduction to 19%; relative reduction 47%) (both P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were more likely to die if they were older at the time of ulceration or had type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal impairment</z:e>, or preexisting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> or were already taking aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prior <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> use, current smoker or ex-smoker status, blood pressure, A1C, and total cholesterol were not significantly different between survivors and those who died in the follow-up periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206172" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Diabetic foot</z:e> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> patients have a high risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Survival has improved over the past 13 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The adoption of an aggressive cardiovascular risk management policy in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206172" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic foot</z:e> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> clinics is recommended for these patients </plain></SENT>
