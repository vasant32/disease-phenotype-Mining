<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 122 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> inadequately controlled (A1c 7-8.5%) on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (&gt; or =1000 mg/day for &gt; or =3 months) were randomized to 16 weeks treatment with 2.5 mg/day glipizide GITS (n=61) or placebo (n=61), in addition to their current <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary efficacy variable was the change in A1c from baseline to endpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Changes in fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG), insulin concentrations, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile and safety variables were also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The addition of glipizide GITS to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> gave significantly greater improvements in mean A1c and FPG from baseline to endpoint than placebo addition (p&lt;0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significantly more patients in the glipizide GITS group than in the placebo group achieved the target A1c level of A1c&lt;7.0% (p&lt;0.0001) and an A1c&lt;6.5% (p&lt;0.0033) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fasting insulin concentrations were similar in both groups and unchanged by treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Addition of glipizide GITS to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> did not produce any significant or clinically relevant <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> or changes in BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both treatment regimens were well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the addition of 2.5 mg glipizide GITS to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> significantly improved <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> inadequately controlled by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy </plain></SENT>
