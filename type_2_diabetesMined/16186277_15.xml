<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who participated in a prospective, community-based study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A wide range of baseline variables were examined to determine whether they predicted future difficulties with 1) mobility and 2) basic activities of daily living (ADLs) in patients free of ADLs difficulty at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To study mobility impairment, subjects with baseline mobility problems were also excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After an average 4.6 +/- 2.3 and 4.8 +/- 2.3 years of follow-up in 818 and 934 patients, respectively, 28.5% of subjects had developed new mobility impairment and 18.1% had developed new ADL disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In Cox proportional hazards models, the risk of mobility impairment was significantly increased by older age (6%/year), <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> (40% increase), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> history (123%), insulin treatment (117%), <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> (82%); taking exercise and being married lowered the risk (by 39 and 32%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The risk of new ADL disability was increased by baseline mobility problems (222% increase), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (92%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1456822" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">claudication</z:e> (67%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (41%) and was also influenced by age, smoking, lack of exercise, non-fluency in English, and indigenous Australian ethnicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Both mobility impairment and ADL disability in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have multiple causes that are due to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> complications and common comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The specific causes of each functional problem are largely distinct, and different approaches may be required to prevent their <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> or progression </plain></SENT>
