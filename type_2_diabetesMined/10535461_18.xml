<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To replicate the recent finding of a type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> locus (NIDDM2) on 12q, families segregating early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal-dominant</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were screened for linkage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Included were 26 Caucasian and 6 non-Caucasian pedigrees with an average age at <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosis of 37 +/- 18 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Affected (n = 233) and nonaffected (n = 152) family members were genotyped for 17 markers covering 90 cM on chromosome 12q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While no evidence for linkage was detected at the NIDDM2 locus, a linkage peak was observed 50 cM centromeric to NIDDM2 at markers D12S375 and D12S1052 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a nonparametric analysis, the Z(<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) score was 2.9 (P = 0.015) at D12S375, and increased to 3.8 (P = 0.007) among Caucasian families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further increase in significance was observed in pedigrees with poor insulin response, with a maximum Z(<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) of 6.2 (P = 0.002) at D12S375 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Suggestive evidence of linkage was also detected by the parametric analysis, with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> logarithm of odds score peaking at 2.5 (alpha = 0.15) between D12S375 and D12S1052 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In summary, our data indicate that the NIDDM2 locus does not play a major role in early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal-dominant</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Rather, they strongly suggest that a previously undetected type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> locus exists 50 cM from NIDDM2 on 12q </plain></SENT>
