<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used two general population studies, The Copenhagen City Heart Study (CCHS, N = 9,121) and The Copenhagen General Population Study (CGPS, N = 24,195), as well as a 1:1 age- and sex-matched population-based case-control study with 6,129 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from the Steno <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Centre and 6,129 control subjects, totaling 8,535 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 37,039 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the combined studies, odds ratios in those with transferrin saturation â‰¥50% vs. &lt;50% were 2.1 (95% CI 1.3-3.4; P = 0.003) for any form of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; 2.6 (1.2-5.6; P = 0.01) for type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; and 1.7 (1.4-2.1; P = 0.001) for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Elevated transferrin saturation confers a two- to threefold increased risk of developing any form of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, as well as type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> separately </plain></SENT>
