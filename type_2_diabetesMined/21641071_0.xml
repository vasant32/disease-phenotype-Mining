<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in vivo, the half-life of GLP-1 is short, which is caused by the degradation of dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) and renal clearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, the stabilization of GLP-1 is critical for its utility in drug development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">Peptides</z:chebi> known as GLP-1 protectors are predicted to increase the half-life of GLP-1 in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Protecting <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> are able to form stable complexes by non-covalent interactions with human GLP-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this study, the stability of the complex was investigated, and the physiological functions of the GLP-1/<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> 1 complex were compared to those of exenatide and liraglutide in animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that the GLP-1/<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> 1 complex remarkably raised the half-life of GLP-1 in vivo and showed better <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance and higher HbA(1c) reduction than exenatide and liraglutide in rodents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based upon these results, it is suggested that the GLP-1/<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> 1 complex might be utilized as a possible potent anti-diabetic drug in the treatment of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
