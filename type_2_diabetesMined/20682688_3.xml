<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, their associations with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels from oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests (OGTTs) in pregnancy have not been assessed in a large sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that these variants are associated with quantitative measures of glycemia in pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed the associations between variants rs1799884 (GCK) and rs7903146 (TCF7L2) and OGTT outcomes at 24-32 weeks' gestation in 3,811 mothers of European (U.K. and Australia) and 1,706 mothers of Asian (Thailand) ancestry from the HAPO cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also tested associations with offspring birth anthropometrics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The maternal GCK variant was associated with higher fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in Europeans (P = 0.001) and Thais (P &lt; 0.0001), 1-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in Europeans (P = 0.001), and 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in Thais (P = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was also associated with higher European offspring birth weight, fat mass, and skinfold thicknesses (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The TCF7L2 variant was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three maternal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> outcomes (P = 0.03, P &lt; 0.0001, and P &lt; 0.0001 for fasting and 1-h and 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, respectively) in the Europeans but not in the Thais (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In both populations, both variants were associated with higher odds of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> mellitus according to the new International Association of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> and Pregnancy Study Groups recommendations (P = 0.001-0.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Maternal GCK and TCF7L2 variants are associated with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels known to carry an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcome in women without overt <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies will be important to determine the variance in maternal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> explained by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> known genetic variants </plain></SENT>
