<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Exercise activation of AMPK is unaffected in lean (BMI approximately 25 kg/m(2)) subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, most type 2 diabetic subjects are <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (BMI &gt;30 kg/m(2)), and exercise stimulation of AMPK is blunted in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> rodents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined whether <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> type 2 diabetic subjects have impaired exercise stimulation of AMPK, at different signaling levels, spanning from the upstream kinase, LKB1, to the putative AMPK targets, AS160 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor coactivator (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi>)-1alpha, involved in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transport regulation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> biogenesis, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twelve type 2 diabetic, eight <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, and eight lean subjects exercised on a cycle ergometer for 40 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Muscle biopsies were done before, during, and after exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subjects underwent this protocol on two occasions, at low (50% Vo(2max)) and moderate (70% Vo(2max)) intensities, with a 4-6 week interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Exercise had no effect on LKB1 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Exercise had a time- and intensity-dependent effect to increase AMPK activity and AS160 phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>Obese</z:mp> and type 2 diabetic subjects had attenuated exercise-stimulated AMPK activity and AS160 phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Type 2 diabetic subjects had reduced basal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi>-1 gene expression but <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> exercise-induced increases in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi>-1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> type 2 diabetic subjects may need to exercise at higher intensity to stimulate the AMPK-AS160 axis to the same level as lean subjects </plain></SENT>
