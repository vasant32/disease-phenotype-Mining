<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A systematic review was carried out to identify randomized controlled trials of sulphonylurea therapy in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> whose glycaemic control was inadequate after maximal treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data on reductions in <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1C) (HbA(1C)), fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) and risk of hypoglycaemic events were extracted from each study and pooled in meta-analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data on weight change were also extracted and tabulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six studies including 1364 patients were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on random effects meta-analysis, the pooled estimate of change in HbA(1C) from baseline was 0.9% (95% CI 0.7-1.1, p = 0.00011 vs. baseline) and for change in FPG from baseline was 1.8 mmol/l (95% CI 1.1-2.5, p = 0.0026 vs. baseline) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The odds of experiencing a hypoglycaemic event was significantly higher in sulphonylurea-treated patients than in those on comparator treatments (OR = 5.3, 95% CI 1.7-16.3, p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean weight change ranged from +2.5 to -0.1 kg, depending on the comparator treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This analysis has demonstrated that, in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> whose control is inadequate on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy, the magnitude of incremental HbA(1C) reduction achieved by the addition of a sulphonylurea is unlikely to exceed 1%, even after titration to maximum tolerated doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additionally, clinically relevant side-effects such as symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> may be experienced </plain></SENT>
