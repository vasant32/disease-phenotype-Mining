<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data sources included MEDLINE and EMBASE between 2001 and 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a search for articles containing mean or geometric mean values of FSI in East Asian patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Monte Carlo method was used for simulation of the mean and standard deviation of individual measures in each ethnic group; calculation of the median ratio and 95% confidence interval of individual measures between ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The initial search identified a total of 996 journal articles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After reviewing the titles and abstracts of these articles, 201 studies were selected for further screening and the complete papers on these studies were then reviewed in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these, seven articles fully met our pre-determined criteria and were included in the meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results of the meta-analysis revealed that FSI level is significantly lower in Japanese patients than in Korean and Chinese patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Results from our review of ethnic differences in dietary habit in the inter-East Asian population suggested that difference in dietary component was one of the most influential factors for the ethnic difference </plain></SENT>
