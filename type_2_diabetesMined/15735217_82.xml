<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis was undertaken to obtain insight regarding the shape and strength of the relationship between alcohol consumption and the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the effects of adjustment for confounders, and the effect of modification by type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> definition, sex, and BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The 15 original prospective cohort studies that were included comprise 11,959 incident cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in 369,862 individuals who, on average, were followed for 12 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After pooling the data, a U-shaped relationship was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared with nonconsumers, the relative risk (RR) for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in those who consumed &lt;/=6 g/day alcohol was 0.87 (95% CI 0.79-0.95) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the moderate consumption ranges of 6-12, 12-24, and 24-48 g/day, RRs of 0.70 (0.61-0.79), 0.69 (0.58-0.81), and 0.72 (0.62-0.84) were found, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in heavy drinkers (&gt;/=48 g/day) was equal to that in nonconsumers (1.04 [0.84-1.29]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In general, nonsignificant trends for larger RR reduction associated with moderate alcohol consumption were observed for women compared with men, for crude compared with multivariate-adjusted analyses, and for studies that used self-reports instead of testing for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> definition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No differences in RR reductions were found between individuals with low or high BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present evidence from observational studies suggests an approximately 30% reduced risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in moderate alcohol consumers, whereas no risk reduction is observed in consumers of &gt;/=48 g/day </plain></SENT>
