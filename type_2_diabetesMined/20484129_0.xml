<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We investigated 49 patients who met the criteria to be in the diabetic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty nondiabetic patients were included in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We set A1C &lt;7% as well-controlled <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum angiogenin level was measured using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum angiogenin levels of poorly controlled patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were significantly lower than those of group with well-controlled <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (361.23 +/- 126.03 ng/ml vs. 446.37 +/- 134.10 ng/ml; P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, they were characterized by a significantly longer duration of the disease (P = 0.006), higher BMI (P = 0.0003), and higher systolic blood pressure (P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Levels of total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> were not significantly different in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with poorly controlled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (A1C &gt;7%) have lower angiogenin levels than patients with well-controlled <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
