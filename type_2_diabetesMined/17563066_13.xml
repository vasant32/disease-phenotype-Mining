<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate whether a polymorphism in the alcohol dehydrogenase 1c (ADH1C) gene modifies the association between alcohol consumption and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In nested case-control studies of 640 women with incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 1,000 control subjects from the Nurses' Health Study and 383 men with incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 382 control subjects from the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, we determined associations between the ADH1C polymorphism, alcohol consumption, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Moderate to heavy alcohol consumption (&gt;5 g/day for women and &gt;10 g/day for men) was associated with a decreased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among women (odds ratio [OR] 0.45 [95% CI 0.33-0.63]) but not men (1.08 [0.67-1.75]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ADH1C genotype modified the relation between alcohol consumption and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for women (P(interaction) = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number of ADH1C*2 alleles, related to a slower rate of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> oxidation, attenuated the lower risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among women consuming &gt;/=5 g alcohol/day (P(trend) = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results were not significant among men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results were similar in pooled analyses (P(interaction) = 0.02) with ORs for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among moderate drinkers of 0.44 (95% CI 0.21-0.94) in ADH1C*1 homozygotes, 0.65 (0.39-1.06) for heterozygotes, and 0.78 (0.50-1.22) for ADH1C*2 homozygotes compared with those for ADH1C*1 homozygote abstainers (P(trend) = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ADH1C genotype modifies the association between alcohol consumption and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ADH1C*2 allele, related to a slower oxidation rate, attenuates the lower <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk among moderate to heavy drinkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the association between alcohol consumption and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may be causal but mediated by downstream metabolites such as <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> rather than <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> itself </plain></SENT>
