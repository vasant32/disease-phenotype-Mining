<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed interactive effects of glycaemia and systolic blood pressure (SBP) exposure on the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS, MATERIALS AND METHODS: HbA(1c) and SBP, measured annually for a median of 10.4 years in 4,320 newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients from the UK Prospective <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study (UKPDS), were categorised as updated mean values &lt;6.0, 6.0-6.9, 7.0-7.9 or &gt; or =8.0%, and &lt;130, 130-139, 140-149 or &gt; or =150 mmHg, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcomes were UKPDS predefined composite endpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidence of the "any <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related endpoint" in the lowest (HbA(1c) &lt;6.0%, SBP &lt;130 mmHg) and highest (HbA(1c) &gt; or =8%, SBP &gt; or =150 mmHg) category combinations was 15 and 82 per 1,000 person-years, respectively, and 24 and 120 per 1,000 person-years in a Poisson model adjusted to white Caucasian male sex, age 50 to 54 years and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration of 7.5 to 12.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Updated mean HbA(1c) and SBP effects were additive in an adjusted proportional hazards model with risk reductions of 21% per 1% HbA(1c) decrement and 11% per 10 mmHg SBP decrement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Endpoint rates obtained in the 887 patients randomised in both the glycaemia and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> intervention trial arms were consistent with the observational data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Those allocated to both intensive <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and tight blood pressure control policies had fewer events than those allocated to either policy alone or to neither (p for trend 0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Risk of complications in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is associated independently and additively with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intensive treatment of both these risk factors is required to minimise the incidence of complications </plain></SENT>
