<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The gene encoding the alpha2 isoform of the catalytic subunit of AMPK (PRKAA2) is located at one of the Japanese type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> loci mapped by our previous genome scan (1p36-32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PRKAA2 is, therefore, a good candidate gene for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We screened <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> nine exons, their exon-intron boundaries, and the 5' and 3' flanking regions of PRKAA2 to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and we genotyped 192 type 2 diabetic patients and 272 nondiabetic subjects to assess possible associations between genotypes or haplotypes and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None of the 10 SNPs genotyped was associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but the haplotype analysis, consisting of six representative SNPs, revealed one haplotype, with the A (minor) allele for rs2051040 and a major allele for the other five SNPs, to be associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This finding was confirmed in two larger replication samples (657 case and 360 control subjects, P = 0.021; and 356 case and 192 control subjects from the same area in Japan, P = 0.007) and a significant P value was obtained in the joint haplotype analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples (1,205 case and 824 control subjects, P = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> was associated with rs2051040 in nondiabetic subjects, and those with the A (minor) allele had a higher homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> index than those who did not (initial control subjects [n = 272], P = 0.002; and joint replication control subjects [n = 552], P = 0.037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We speculate that the PRKAA2 gene influences <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the Japanese population </plain></SENT>
