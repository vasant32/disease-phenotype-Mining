<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 183 African-American adults aged 35-75 years with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were recruited from two primary care clinics in East Baltimore, Maryland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Depressive symptoms, using the Center for Epidemiological Studies <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Scale (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e>-D), HbA1c, fasting <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile, BMI, and blood pressure, were measured on each participant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp>-related health behaviors were assessed by questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of depressive symptoms (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e>-D &gt; or =22) was 30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for age, sex, income, social support, and duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in linear regression models, there were significant graded relationships between greater depressive symptoms and higher serum levels of cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (P&lt;0.050) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similar, albeit less statistically significant, relationships were found with higher levels of HbA1c (P = 0.104), diastolic blood pressure (P = 0.073), and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (P = 0.176) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, individuals who reported more depressive symptoms also had higher serum levels of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (P = 0.047) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The associations were not explained by differences in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related health behaviors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Depressive symptoms are marginally associated with suboptimal levels of HbA1c, diastolic blood pressure, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, and significantly associated with suboptimal levels of total cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Prospective studies are required to determine whether improved identification and management of depressive symptoms would enhance metabolic control in this population </plain></SENT>
