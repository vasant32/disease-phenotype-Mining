<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>Low birth weight</z:hpo> is consistently associated with an increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in adulthood, but the individual contributions from poor fetal growth and preterm birth are not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore investigated the significance of these two factors separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We identified a cohort of subjects born preterm or with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birth weight</z:hpo> at term at four major delivery units in Sweden from 1925 through 1949 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A comparison cohort of subjects was identified from the same source population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of 6,425 subjects in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 2,931 were born at &lt;37 weeks of gestation and 2,176 had a birth weight &lt;2,500 g </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Disease occurrence among participants was assessed through nationwide hospital registers from 1987 through 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During follow-up, there were 508 cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>Low birth weight</z:hpo> was strongly negatively associated with risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P for trend &lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both short gestational duration and poor fetal growth were associated with later <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P for trend &lt;0.0001 and &lt;0.0004, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Very preterm birth (&lt; or =32 weeks of gestation at birth) was associated with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.67 (95% CI 1.33-2.11) compared with term birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Birth weights below 2 SDs of mean birth weight for gestational age were associated with an HR of 1.76 (1.30-2.38) compared with birth weights between the mean weight and the weight at 1 SD above the mean </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birth weight</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is due to factors associated with both poor fetal growth and short gestational age </plain></SENT>
