<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, we have further suggested that the translocation of GLUT4 is stimulated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> in L6 myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the direct effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> on translocation of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transporters have not yet been determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, using hemagglutinin <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi>-tagged GLUT4 (GLUT4-HA), we provide direct evidence of the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> on the translocation of GLUT4 in rat epididymal adipocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Primary cultures of rat adipocytes were transiently transfected with GLUT4-HA and overexpressed eightfold compared with endogenous GLUT4 in transfected cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 24 h of treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> (10(-4) mol/l) increased the cell surface level of GLUT4-HA by 1.5 +/- 0.03-fold (P &lt; 0.01) without changing the total amount of GLUT4-HA, whereas it increased the protein level of endogenous GLUT4 (1.4-fold) without changing that of GLUT1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, the direct effect on the translocation can be detected apart from the increase in endogenous GLUT4 content using GLUT4-HA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">Troglitazone</z:chebi> not only increased the translocation of GLUT4-HA on the cell surface in the basal state but also caused a leftward shift in the dose-response relations between GLUT4-HA translocation and insulin concentration in the medium (ED(50): from approximately 0.1 to 0.03 nmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These effects may partly contribute to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> activity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
