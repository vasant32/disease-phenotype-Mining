<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pio treatment (up to 28 days) decreased the insulin-resistant and hyperlipidemic states and increased food consumption and whole-body <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis and weights of fat pads demonstrated that the increase in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> was not only limited to the major fat depots but also to fat deposition throughout the body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adipocyte sizing profiles, fat pad histology, and DNA content show that Pio treatment increased the number of small adipocytes because of both the appearance of new adipocytes and the shrinkage and/or disappearance of existing mature adipocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The remodeling was time dependent, with new small adipocytes appearing in clusters throughout the fat pad, and accompanied by a three- to fourfold increase in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50744">citrate</z:chebi> synthase and fatty acid synthase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The appearance of new fat cells and the increase in fat mass were depot specific, with a rank order of responsiveness of ovarian &gt; retroperitoneal &gt; subcutaneous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This differential depot effect resulted in a redistribution of the fat mass in the abdominal region such that there was an increase in the visceral:subcutaneous ratio, as confirmed by MRI analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although the <z:mp ids='MP_0010024'>increased adiposity</z:mp> is paradoxical to an improvement in insulin sensitivity, the quantitative increase of adipose mass should be viewed in context of the qualitative changes in adipose tissue, including the remodeling of adipocytes to a smaller size with higher <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> storage potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This shift in energy balance is likely to result in lower circulating free fatty acid levels, ultimately improving insulin sensitivity and the metabolic state </plain></SENT>
