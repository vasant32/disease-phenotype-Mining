<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To estimate the rates of prevalence, diagnosis, and treatment of impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (IFG) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A representative sample of the U.S. population (the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey [NHANES]) from 2005-2006 including 1,547 nondiabetic adults (&gt;18 years of age) without a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> was assessed to determine the proportion of adults who met the criteria for IFG/IGT, and the proportion of IFG/IGT subjects who: 1) reported receiving a diagnosis from their physicians; 2) were prescribed lifestyle modification or an antihyperglycemic agent; and 3) were currently on therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used multivariable regression analysis to identify predictors of diagnosis and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 1,547 subjects, 34.6% (CI 30.3-38.9%) had pre-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; 19.4% had IFG only; 5.4% had IGT only, and 9.8% had both IFG and IGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only 4.8% of those with pre-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> reported having received a formal diagnosis from their physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No subjects with pre-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> received oral antihyperglycemics, and the rates of recommendation for exercise or diet were 31.7% and 33.5%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the 47.7% <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pre-diabetic</z:e> subjects who exercised, 49.4% reported exercising for at least 30 min daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Three years after a major clinical trial demonstrated that interventions could greatly reduce progression from IFG/IGT to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the majority of the U.S. population with IFG/IGT was undiagnosed and untreated with interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Whether this is due to physicians being unaware of the evidence, unconvinced by the evidence, or clinical inertia is unclear </plain></SENT>
