<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pickup and colleagues supporting the hypothesis that type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is caused by activated innate immunity, published in Diabetologia in 1997 (40:1286-1292), are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These initial findings led to research that has uncovered links between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, circulating immune markers, immunogenetic susceptibility, macrophage function and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genetic variations leading to the altered production or function of circulating innate immune proteins, cellular pattern recognition receptors and inflammatory cytokines are linked to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Components of the innate immune system in the muscle, bone, liver and adipose tissue, as well as macrophages, have been revealed to play a role in systemic insulin action </plain></SENT>
