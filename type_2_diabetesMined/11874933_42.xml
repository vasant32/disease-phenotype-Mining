<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A cohort of 10,000 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was simulated using a model based on existing epidemiological studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Complication rates were estimated for various stages of macrovascular disease, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the beginning of the simulation, patients were assumed to have been treated for 5 years and have a mean HbA1c of 8.4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From the U.K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prospective <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study, it was estimated that on current therapies, the HbA1c would drift upward on average 0.15% per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Direct medical costs of managing each complication were estimated (in 2000 U.S. dollars) from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-payor databases, surveys, and literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Macrovascular disease was estimated to be the largest cost component, accounting for 85% of cumulative costs of complications over the first 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The costs of complications were estimated to be $47,240 per patient over 30 years, on average </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The management of macrovascular disease is estimated to be the largest cost component, accounting for 52% of the costs; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> accounts for 21%, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> accounts for 17%, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> accounts for 10% of the costs of complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The complications of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> account for substantial costs, with management of macrovascular disease being the largest and earliest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>If improving glycemic control prevents complications, it will reduce these costs </plain></SENT>
