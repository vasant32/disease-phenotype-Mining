<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We selected population-based studies carried out after 1980 in the DECODE/A studies representing different ethnic groups: 11 European, 1 Maltese, 3 Indian, 2 Chinese and 3 Japanese surveys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The total numbers of subjects were 14,240 men and 15,129 women who were 30 to 89 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> was diagnosed according to the 1999 World Health Organization criteria based on a standard 75 g OGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sex-specific prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by age and BMI was stratified by ethnic group, in particular the interaction of ethnicity on the associations between age/BMI and the prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was higher in studies from India and Malta compared to Japan, China, and the rest of Europe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The association between BMI and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, adjusted for age, showed noticeable differences between the ethnic groups with an increase in prevalence starting at a BMI between 15 and 20 kg/m(2) in the Maltese and Indian populations compared to 25 kg/m(2 )in Europeans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: The effect of BMI on the age-adjusted prevalence of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was modified by ethnicity with considerably lower thresholds in Indian and Maltese subjects compared to those from the rest of Europe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This difference should be reflected in national and international recommendations regarding "optimal" BMI </plain></SENT>
