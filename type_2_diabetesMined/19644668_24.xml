<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE and major American and European conference abstracts for randomised controlled trials up to October 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A systematic review and meta-analyses were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-two trials that randomised 4,379 patients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven trials reported both starting insulin dose and titration schedules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hypoglycaemia</z:e> definitions and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> targets varied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Meta-analyses were performed pooling data from insulin-naive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Greater HbA(1c) reductions were seen with biphasic and prandial insulin, compared with basal insulin, of 0.45% (95% CI 0.19-0.70, p = 0.0006) and 0.45% (95% CI 0.16-0.73, p = 0.002), respectively, but with lesser reductions of fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> of 0.93 mmol/l (95% CI 0.21-1.65, p = 0.01) and 2.20 mmol/l (95% CI 1.70-2.70, p &lt; 0.00001), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Larger insulin doses at study end were reported in biphasic and prandial arms compared with basal arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No studies found differences in major hypoglycaemic events, but minor hypoglycaemic events for prandial and biphasic insulin were inconsistently reported as either higher than or equivalent to basal insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Greater <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> was seen with prandial compared with basal insulin (1.86 kg, 95% CI 0.80-2.92, p = 0.0006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Greater HbA(1c) reduction may be obtained in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> when insulin is initiated using biphasic or prandial insulin rather than a basal regimen, but with an unquantified risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Studies with longer follow-up are required to determine the clinical relevance of this finding </plain></SENT>
