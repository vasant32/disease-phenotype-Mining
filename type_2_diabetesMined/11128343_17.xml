<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present multicenter study was to evaluate which clinical characteristics are associated with the development of a symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">UTI</z:e> during an 18-month follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients with either type 1 or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were between 18 and 75 years of age were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Follow-up results were available for 589 of the 636 women included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were interviewed, their medical history was noted, and at least one uncontaminated urine culture was collected at the moment of study entry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 589 women, 115 (20%) developed a symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">UTI</z:e>, 96 (83%) of whom were prescribed antimicrobial therapy A total of 34 women (14%) with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> developed a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">UTI</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most important risk factor for these women was sexual intercourse during the week before entry into the study (44% without vs. 53% with sexual intercourse, relative risk [RR] = 3.0, P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 81 (23%) women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> developed a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">UTI</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most important risk factor for these women was the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262380" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">asymptomatic bacteriuria</z:e> (ASB) at baseline (25% without vs. 42% with ASB, RR = 1.65, P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors for developing a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">UTI</z:e> are the presence of ASB for women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and sexual intercourse during the week before entry into the study for women with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
