<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We genotyped 116,204 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 281 Mexican Americans with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 280 random Mexican Americans from Starr County, Texas, using the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping 100K set </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Allelic association exact tests were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our most significant SNPs were compared with results from other type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> genome-wide association studies (GWASs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Proportions of African, European, and Asian ancestry were estimated from the HapMap samples using structure for each individual to rule out spurious association due to population substructure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We observed more significant allelic associations than expected genome wide, as empirically assessed by permutation (14 below a P of 1 x 10(-4) [8.7 expected]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were observed between the proportion of ancestry estimates in the case and random control sets, suggesting that the association results were not likely confounded by substructure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A query of our top approximately 1% of SNPs (P &lt; 0.01) revealed SNPs in or near four genes that showed evidence for association (P &lt; 0.05) in multiple other GWAS interrogated: rs979752 and rs10500641 near UBQLNL and OR52H1 on chromosome 11, rs2773080 and rs3922812 in or near RALGPS2 on chromosome 1, and rs1509957 near EGR2 on chromosome 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We identified several SNPs with suggestive evidence for replicated association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> that merit further investigation </plain></SENT>
