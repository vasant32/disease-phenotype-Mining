<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eleven patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> participated in two experimental sessions; one was a 30-min EMS 30 min after a breakfast (EMS trial) and the other was a complete rest after a breakfast (Control trial) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In each trial, blood was sampled before and at 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after the meal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level was significantly attenuated in EMS trial at 60, 90, and 120 min after a meal (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> concentration was also significantly lowered in EMS trial (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, there was no significant increase in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> phosphokinase (CPK) concentration in each trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present results provide first evidence indicating that EMS is a new exercise method for treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0011998'>postprandial hyperglycemia</z:hpo> in individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, especially who cannot perform adequate voluntary exercise because of excessive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, orthopedic diseases, or severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> </plain></SENT>
