<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This review article depicts a new role for K(ATP) channels by showing that genetic or pharmacological ablation of these channels protects β-cells against <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Increased production of oxidants is a crucial factor in the pathogenesis of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>T2DM develops when β-cells can no longer compensate for the high demand of insulin resulting from excess fuel intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Instead β-cells start to secrete less insulin and β-cell mass is diminished by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both, reduction of insulin secretion and β-cell mass induced by <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, are prevented by deletion or inhibition of K(ATP) channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings may open up new insights into the early treatment of T2DM </plain></SENT>
