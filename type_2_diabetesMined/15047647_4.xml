<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> reduces the levels of circulating immune complexes (ICs) containing modified <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> (mLDLs; mLDL-ICs), which may represent an additional mechanism for the reduced incidence of cardiovascular events in patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 26 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels &lt;400 mg/dl who were not receiving <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering medications or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38559">CYP</z:chebi> 3A4 inhibitors were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After 2 weeks on a <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering diet and exercise, the patients were started on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> 20 mg/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> was adjusted until the levels of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> were &lt; or =100 mg/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood was collected at baseline, 3 and 6 months after <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> levels reached target, and 3 months after stopping <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> to measure advanced glycation end product <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> and oxidized <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> antibodies, mLDL-IC, intracellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 (VCAM-1), E-selectin, metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1), <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile, liver function tests, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> kinase, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and HbA(1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-one patients completed the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Their HbA(1c) remained within 1% of baseline levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a highly significant decrease in mLDL-IC levels after 3 and 6 months of treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi>, with a return to near baseline levels after discontinuation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">Simvastatin</z:chebi> significantly reduced the concentration of mLDL-IC, probably as a consequence of both a decrease in the formation of mLDL and to a reduction in the titers of mLDL antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This effect is likely to have a beneficial impact in the inflammatory reaction associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
