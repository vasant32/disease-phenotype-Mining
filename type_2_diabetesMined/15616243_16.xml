<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This investigation aimed to evaluate the impact of family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on insulin secretion relative to insulin sensitivity in healthy children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>beta-Cell compensation for insulin sensitivity was calculated as the product of insulin sensitivity x first-phase insulin secretion, termed <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposition index (GDI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 28 healthy white children (12 boys and 16 girls; 12.1 +/- 0.5 years of age) with a positive family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 26 healthy white children (13 boys and 13 girls; 11.5 +/- 0.4 years of age) with a negative family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> underwent a 3-h 40 mU.m(-2).min(-1) hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp to assess insulin sensitivity and clearance and a 2-h hyperglycemic clamp to assess insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Body composition and visceral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> were evaluated with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and computed tomography at the L4-L5 intervertebral space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Insulin sensitivity was lower in children with a family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> versus children without a family history (8.8 +/- 0.9 vs. 12.2 +/- 1.1 micromol.kg(-1).min(-1) per pmol/l, P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, insulin clearance was lower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>First- and second-phase insulin levels were not different between groups with and without a positive family history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The GDI was lower in youth with versus youth without a positive family history (4.1 +/- 0.3 vs. 5.2 +/- 0.5 mmol.kg(-1).min(-1), P = 0.039) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>IGF binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) was 60% lower in youth with versus youth without the positive family history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in white children is associated with decreased insulin sensitivity and clearance, decreased IGFBP-1, and an impaired relationship between insulin action and beta-cell compensation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Detection of these alterations in hormonal and metabolic parameters in children with a positive family history suggests that at least some of the determinants of GDI are genetic/heritable </plain></SENT>
