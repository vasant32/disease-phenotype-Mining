<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To prospectively examine the effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> 1 year after laparoscopic adjustable gastric band surgery on a broad range of health outcomes in 50 diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 50 (17 men, 33 women) of 51 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, from a total of 500 consecutive patients, were studied preoperatively and again 1 year after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Preoperative weight and BMI (means +/- SD) were 137 +/- 30 kg and 48.2 +/- 8 kg/m(2), respectively; at 1 year, weight and BMI were 110 +/- 24 kg and 38.7 +/- 6 kg/m(2), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was significant improvement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> measures of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Remission of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> occurred in 32 patients (64%), and major improvement of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control occurred in 13 patients (26%); <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism was unchanged in 5 patients (10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HbA(1c) was 7.8 +/- 3.2% preoperatively and 6.2 +/- 2.7% at 1 year (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Remission of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was predicted by greater <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and a shorter history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (pseudo r(2) = 0.44, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Improvement in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was related to <z:mp ids='MP_0002891'>increased insulin sensitivity</z:mp> and beta-cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>Weight loss</z:hpo> was associated with significant improvements in fasting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> level, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> level, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, sleep, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, appearance evaluation, and health-related quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Early complications occurred in 6% of patients (wound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> in 4%, respiratory support in 2%), and late complications occurred in 30% of patients (gastric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> in 20%, band <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosion</z:mpath> in 6%, and tubing leaks in 4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> late complications were successfully revised surgically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Modern laparoscopic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight-loss</z:hpo> surgery is effective in managing the broad range of health problems experienced by severely <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Surgery should be considered as an early intervention </plain></SENT>
