<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that breaking advanced glycation end product (AGE) cross-links could improve remodeling in mesenteric resistance arteries in <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats compared with lean <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> (LZ) rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Arteries, exposed to high (HF) or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (NF) blood flow after alternate arterial ligation in vivo, were collected after 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In LZ rats, HF artery diameter was larger than for NF vessels, but this was not the case in ZDF rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endothelium-mediated dilation in ZDF rats, which was lower than in LZ rats, was further decreased in HF arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment of rats with the AGE-breaker 4,5-dimethyl-3-phenacylthiazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (ALT-711) (3 mg/kg/day; 3 weeks) reversed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-induced impairment of HF-dependent remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ALT-711 also improved endothelium nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi>-dependent relaxation in mesenteric resistance arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reactive oxygen species reduction restored relaxation in ZDF rats but not in LZ or ALT-711-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>AGEs were reduced in ALT-711-treated ZDF rats compared with ZDF rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Metalloproteinase activity, necessary for HF-dependent remodeling, was reduced in ZDF rats compared with LZ rats and restored by ALT-711 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, targeting AGE cross-links may provide a therapeutic potential for overcoming microvascular complications in ischemic disorders occurring in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
