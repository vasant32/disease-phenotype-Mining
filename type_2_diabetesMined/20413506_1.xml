<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>NCX1 is alternatively spliced, resulting in the expression of splice variants in different tissues such as NCX1.3 and -1.7 in beta-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As pharmacological inhibitors of NCX1 splice variants are in development, the pharmacological profile of beta-cell NCX1.3 and -1.7 and the cellular effects of NCX1 inhibition were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The patch-clamp technique was used to examine the pharmacological profile of the NCX1 inhibitor KB-R7943 on recombinant NCX1.3 and -1.7 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ca(2+) imaging and membrane capacitance were used to assess the effects of KB-R7943 on Ca(2+)(c) and insulin secretion in mouse and human beta-cells and islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: NCX1.3 and -1.7 calcium extrusion (forward-mode) activity was approximately 16-fold more sensitive to KB-R7943 inhibition compared with cardiac NCX1.1 (IC(50s) = 2.9 and 2.4 vs. 43.0 micromol/l, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In single mouse/human beta-cells, 1 micromol/l KB-R7943 increased insulin granule exocytosis but was without effect on alpha-cell glucagon granule exocytosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>KB-R7943 also augmented <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated Ca(2+)(c) levels and insulin secretion in mouse and human islets, although KB-R7943 was without effect under nonstimulated conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Islet NCX1 splice variants display a markedly greater sensitivity to pharmacological inhibition than the cardiac NCX1.1 splice variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>NCX1 inhibition resulted in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent increases in Ca(2+)(c) and insulin secretion in mouse and human islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, we identify beta-cell NCX1 splice variants as targets for the development of novel <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-sensitive insulinotropic drugs for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
