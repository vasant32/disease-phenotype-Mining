<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the safety, tolerability and efficacy of liraglutide monotherapy compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> monotherapy over 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Participants were randomized to receive once-daily liraglutide 1.2 mg, liraglutide 1.8 mg or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> 8 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Participants completing the 1-year randomized, double-blind, double-dummy period could continue open-label treatment for an additional year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Safety data were evaluated for the full population exposed to treatment, and efficacy data were evaluated for the full intention-to-treat (ITT) and 2-year completer populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Outcome measures included change in glycosylated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA1c), fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG), body weight and frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For patients completing 2 years of therapy, HbA1c reductions were -0.6% with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> versus -0.9% with liraglutide 1.2 mg (difference: -0.37, 95% CI: -0.71 to -0.02; p = 0.0376) and -1.1% with liraglutide 1.8 mg (difference: -0.55, 95% CI: -0.88 to -0.21; p = 0.0016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the ITT population, HbA1c reductions were -0.3% with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> versus -0.6% with liraglutide 1.2 mg (difference: -0.31, 95% CI: -0.54 to -0.08; p = 0.0076) and -0.9% with liraglutide 1.8 mg (difference: -0.60, 95% CI: -0.83 to -0.38; p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For both ITT and completer populations, liraglutide was more effective in reducing HbA1c, FPG and weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Over 2 years, rates of minor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> [self-treated plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &lt;3.1 mmol/l (&lt;56 mg/dl)] were significantly lower with liraglutide 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Liraglutide monotherapy for 2 years provides significant and sustained improvements in glycaemic control and body weight compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> monotherapy, at a lower risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
