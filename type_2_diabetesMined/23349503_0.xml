<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We measured spillover in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 13) using infusions of a [(3)H] <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53753">triolein</z:chebi>-labeled <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> emulsion and [U-(13)C] <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30823">oleate</z:chebi> during continuous feeding, before and after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Body fat was measured with dual energy X-ray absorptiometry and CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Participants lost ∼14% of body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a ∼38% decrease in meal-suppressed FFA concentration (P&lt; 0.0001) and a ∼23% decrease in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30823">oleate</z:chebi> flux (P=0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fractional spillover did not change (P=NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At baseline, there was a strong negative correlation between spillover and leg fat (r =-0.79, P=0.001) and a positive correlation with trunk:leg fat ratio (R=0.56, P=0.047) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These correlations disappeared after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Baseline leg fat (R=-0.61, P=0.027) but not trunk fat (R= - 0.27, P=0.38), negatively predicted decreases in spillover with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that spillover, a measure of inefficiency in dietary fat storage, is inversely associated with lower body fat in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
