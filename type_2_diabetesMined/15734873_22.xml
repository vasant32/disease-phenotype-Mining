<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Genome-wide linkage analyses were performed using a multipoint variance components method in eight study groups from four multicenter networks (whites and blacks in GenNet; whites, blacks, and Mexican Americans in GENOA; whites and blacks in HyperGEN; and Asians in SAPPHIRe) that comprise the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Family Blood Pressure Program (FBPP), in order to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) influencing fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, and homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-IR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These study populations were enriched with subjects who had elevated blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants fasting &lt;8 h, those with a history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, or those on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> medications were excluded from the current investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These three phenotypes were suitably transformed to approximate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> distributions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each phenotype was adjusted for the effects of age, BMI, and field center separately by sex within each of the eight network ethnicity groups before genetic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 8,664 subjects comprising 5,923 sibpairs from 4,043 families with 365 markers were available for conducting a meta-analysis using a modified Fisher's method of combining the P values from each of the eight scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Evidence of linkages was found on chromosome 7q36 at 163 cM, with a logarithm of odds (LOD) score of 3.21 for HOMA-IR, and on chromosome 19q13 at 88 cM, with a LOD score of 3.33 for fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also found suggestive linkages (LOD score &gt;/=2.2) on chromosome 7q36 at 163 cM, with LOD scores of 2.31 for fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and 2.26 for fasting insulin (versus the LOD score of 3.21 for HOMA-IR at this locus) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, QTLs were identified on chromosomes 7q36 and 19q13 for fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in large and multiple-ethnicity populations in the FBPP with good replications across several other independent studies for relevant traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Follow-up dense mapping and association studies are warranted </plain></SENT>
