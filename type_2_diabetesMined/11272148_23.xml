<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Transport of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> across the plasma membrane of pancreatic islet beta-cells is slow, as described by Sekine et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>(J Biol Chem 269:4895-4902, 1994), which is a feature that may be important for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> nutrient-induced insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although eight members of the monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) family have now been identified, the expression of these isoforms within the exocrine and <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> pancreas has not been explored in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using immunocytochemical analysis of pancreatic sections fixed in situ, we demonstrated three phenomena </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>First, immunoreactivity of the commonly expressed <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> transporter isoform MCT1 is near zero in both alpha- and beta-cells but is abundant in the pancreatic acinar cell plasma membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No MCT2 or MCT4 was detected in any pancreatic cell type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Second, Western analysis of purified beta- and non-beta-cell membranes revealed undetectable levels of MCT1 and MCT4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In derived beta-cell lines, MCT1 was absent from MIN6 cells and present in low amounts in INS-1 cell membranes and at high levels in RINm5F cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MCT4 was weakly expressed in MIN6 beta-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Third, CD147, an MCT-associated chaperone protein, which is closely colocalized with MCT1 on acinar cell membranes, was absent from islet cell membranes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CD147 was also largely absent from MIN6 and INS-1 cells but abundant in RINm5F cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Low expression of MCT1, MCT2, and MCT4 contributes to the enzymatic configuration of beta-cells, which is poised to ensure <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> oxidation and the generation of metabolic signals and may also be important for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> sensing in islet non-beta-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>MCT overexpression throughout the islet could contribute to deranged hormone secretion in some forms of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
