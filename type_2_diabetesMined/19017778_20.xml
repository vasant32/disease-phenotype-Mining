<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 2,442 subjects from the Botnia Study, who were free of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at baseline, received an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) at baseline and after 7-8 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Future risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was assessed with area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve for prediction models based up measurement of the FPG concentration 1) with or without a 1-h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration during the OGTT and 2) with or without the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Prediction models based on measurement of the FPG concentration were weak predictors for the risk of future type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Addition of a 1-h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration markedly enhanced prediction of the risk of future type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A cut point of 155 mg/dl for the 1-h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration during the OGTT and presence of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> were used to stratify subjects in each <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance group into low, intermediate, and high risk for future type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration at 1 h during the OGTT is a strong predictor of future risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and adds to the prediction power of models based on measurements made during the fasting state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> cut point of 155 mg/dl plus the Adult Treatment Panel III criteria for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> can be used to stratify nondiabetic subjects into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups </plain></SENT>
