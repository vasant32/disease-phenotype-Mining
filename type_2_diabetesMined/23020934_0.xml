<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Besides performing pairwise meta-analysis, network meta-analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> RCTs was used to combine direct and indirect estimates of the effect of GLP-1 with placebo, active comparator drugs (ACD), or another GLP-1 agent with treatment duration â‰¥8 weeks in T2DM patients, 15,883 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> safety from 45 RCTs and 14,136 for glycemic control from 36 RCTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> safety, both of the results from pairwise and network meta-analysis failed to demonstrate significant difference between any two comparators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For glycemic control, the effect of any GLP-1 was better than placebo, but no difference was found between GLP-1s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also found that liraglutide was the only GLP-1 drug shown to be more effective on improving glycemic control than ACD and exenatide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results based on direct or indirect estimates were similar for two outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our network meta-analysis provides a complete picture of the associations between GLP-1s, ACD and placebo on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> safety and glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The GLP-1s are promising candidates for the treatment of T2DM, but more long-term trials are needed to confirm potential <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> safety </plain></SENT>
