<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One hundred and thirty-three type 2 diabetic outpatients followed the CD (n=57, 1734+/-410 kcal, carbohydrate:protein:fat ratio=57:16:26) or CARD (n=76, 1773+/-441 kcal, carbohydrate:protein:fat ratio=45:18:33) according to their own will, and were followed up for 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Glycemic control, body mass index (BMI), serum cholesterols and dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs were assessed at baseline and after 1 and 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At baseline, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA1c) and BMI levels were 7.1+/-1.0% and 24.2+/-2.9, respectively, in the CD group, and 7.4+/-1.1% and 25.1+/-3.4 in the CARD group, showing no significant differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the 2-year follow-up period, HbA1c levels were significantly improved in the CARD group (CD: 7.5+/-1.3%, CARD: 6.7+/-0.6%, P&lt;0.001), and BMI decreased more significantly in the CARD group (CD: 23.8+/-3.0, CARD: 23.8+/-3.5, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> clearly tapered, and serum cholesterol profiles improved significantly with the CARD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results warrant a long-term and large-scale randomized study of the diet for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
