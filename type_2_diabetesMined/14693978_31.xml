<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted an analysis of 72,178 female nurses aged 45-72 years who did not have diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and who answered the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Status Survey (SF-36) at baseline in 1992 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We calculated relative risks (RR) of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for women with presence of depressive symptoms (i.e., Five-Item Mental Health Index [MHI-5] score &gt;52) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During 4 years of follow-up (282,317 person-years), 973 incident cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Age-adjusted RR of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for women with presence of depressive symptoms was 1.55 (95% CI 1.27-1.90) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additional adjustment for BMI resulted in a RR of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> of 1.36 (1.11-1.67) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The multivariate RR of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 1.22 (1.00-1.50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After excluding women diagnosed with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> between 1992 and 1994, 472 incident cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were documented for the follow-up period from 1994 to 1996 (148,889 person-years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The multivariate RR of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for women with depressive symptoms was 1.29 (0.96-1.72) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that depressive symptoms are associated with a modest increase in the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
