<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we performed a two-stage genome-wide association analysis in Korean women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the stage 1 genome scan, 468 women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> and 1,242 nondiabetic control women were compared using 2.19 million genotyped or imputed markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We selected 11 loci for further genotyping in stage 2 samples of 931 case and 783 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The joint effect of stage 1 plus stage 2 studies was analyzed by meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also investigated the effect of known type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> variants in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two loci known to be associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had a genome-wide significant association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> in the joint analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>rs7754840, a variant in CDKAL1, had the strongest association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> (odds ratio 1.518; P=6.65×10(-16)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A variant near MTNR1B, rs10830962, was also significantly associated with the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> (1.454; P=2.49×10(-13)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We found that there is an excess of association between known type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> variants and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> above what is expected under the null hypothesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we have confirmed that genetic variants in CDKAL1 and near MTNR1B are strongly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> in Korean women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There seems to be a shared genetic basis between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
