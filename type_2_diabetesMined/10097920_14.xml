<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of lifestyle (diet composition, level of physical activity) on plasma leptin concentrations among Pima Indians living in drastically different environments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 224 Mexican Pima Indians (115 women, 109 men) living a traditional lifestyle in a remote, mountainous area of northwest Mexico and 418 U.S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pima Indians (281 women, 137 men) living a North American lifestyle on the Gila River Indian Reservation in Arizona </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the absolute value of leptin would be lower in Mexican Pima Indians because of their lower percent body fat, but could be further influenced by their lifestyle, independent of body composition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Leptin concentration (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]) was strongly correlated with percent fat (bioimpedance) in Mexican Pima Indians (r = 0.83, P &lt; 0.0001) and U.S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pima Indians (r = 0.86, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among U.S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pima Indians, independent of percent fat, subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had lower leptin than nondiabetic subjects (difference = 6.9 +/- 1.0 ng/ml, P &lt; 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among nondiabetic subjects, Mexican Pima Indians had lower absolute leptin concentrations than U.S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pima Indians, but higher after adjustment for percent body fat, waist circumference, age, and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In a subset of 70 pairs of subjects matched for sex and percent body fat, leptin concentration was 4.4 +/- 1.0 ng/ml (P &lt; 0.0001) higher in Mexican Pima Indians versus U.S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Pima Indians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that independent of body composition, leptin concentration may be increased by environmental factors, such as a high-carbohydrate diet and a high level of physical activity </plain></SENT>
