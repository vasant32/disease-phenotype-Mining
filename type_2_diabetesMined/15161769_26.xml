<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied 64 families, segregating type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, of which 57 had at least one member with an age at diagnosis of &lt;/=40 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These families included a total of 126 affected sibpairs and 4 other affected relative pairs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nonparametric linkage analysis revealed seven regions showing nominal evidence for linkage with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (logarithm of odds [LOD] &gt;0.59, P(pointwise) &lt; 0.05): chromosome 1 at 173.9 cM (LOD = 3.09), chromosome 3 at 26.3 cM (LOD = 1.27), chromosome 4 at 135.3 cM (LOD = 2.63), chromosome 5 at 139.3 cM (LOD = 0.84), chromosome 6 at 178.9 cM (LOD = 1.91), chromosome 12 at 48.7 cM (LOD = 1.99), and chromosome 18 at 28.1 cM (LOD = 1.00) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Simulation studies showed genome-wide significant evidence for linkage of the chromosome 1 region (P(genome-wide) = 0.036) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have confirmed the results of previous studies for the presence of a susceptibility locus on chromosome 1q21-q25 (173.9 cM) and suggest the locations of other loci that may contribute to the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Hong Kong Chinese </plain></SENT>
