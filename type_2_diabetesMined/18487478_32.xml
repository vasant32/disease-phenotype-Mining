<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 1,611 subjects from the San Antonio Heart Study, who were free of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at baseline; who had plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin concentrations measured at time 0, 30, 60, and 120 min during the oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT); and who had their <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> status determined with an OGTT after 7-8 years of follow-up, were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two models, based on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance status, 1-h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration, and presence of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e>, were tested in predicting the risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at 7-8 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A cutoff point of 155 mg/dl for the 1-h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration during the OGTT was used to stratify subjects in each <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance group into low, intermediate, and high risk for future type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A model based upon 1-h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration, Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III criteria for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e>, and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, independent of 2-h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, performed equally well in stratifying nondiabetic subjects into low, intermediate, and high risk for future type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and identified a group of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-tolerant subjects who were at very high risk for future type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration at 1 h during the OGTT is a strong predictor of future risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> cutoff point of 155 mg/dl and the ATP III criteria for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> can be used to stratify nondiabetic subjects into three risk groups: low, intermediate, and high risk </plain></SENT>
