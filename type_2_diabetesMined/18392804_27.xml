<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This review critically appraises studies examining the association of novel factors with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We show that many of the most studied novel and apparently 'independent' risk factors are correlated with each other by virtue of their common origins or pathways, and that residual confounding is likely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Available studies also have other limitations, including differences in methodology or inadequate statistical analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, although most relevant work in this area has focused on improving our understanding of the pathogenesis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, association studies in isolation cannot prove causality; intervention studies with specific agents (if available) are required, and genetic studies may help </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With respect to the potential value of novel risk factors for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk prediction, we illustrate why this work is very much in its infancy and currently not guaranteed to reach clinical utility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the existence of several more easily measured powerful predictors of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, suggests that the additional value of novel markers may be limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, several suggestions to improve relevant research are given </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, we show that several risk factors for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are only weakly associated with the risk of incident vascular events, an observation that highlights the limitations of attempting to devise unified criteria (e.g. <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e>) to identify individuals at risk of both CHD and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
