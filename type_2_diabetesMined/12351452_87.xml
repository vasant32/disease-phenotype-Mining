<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Various growth factors and cytokines have been implicated in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011881" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic kidney disease</z:e>, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To explore a role for VEGF in renal changes in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we examined the renal effects of a neutralizing murine VEGF antibody in the diabetic db/db mouse, a model of <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One group of db/db mice was treated for 2 months with a VEGF antibody, while another db/db group was treated for the same period with an isotype-matched irrelevant IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A third group consisting of nondiabetic db/+ mice was treated with the same isotype-matched IgG for 2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Placebo-treated db/db mice showed a pronounced increase in kidney weight, glomerular volume, basement membrane thickness (BMT), total mesangial volume, urinary albumin excretion (UAE), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance (CrCl) when compared with nondiabetic controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In VEGF antibody-treated db/db mice, increases in kidney weight, glomerular volume, BMT, and UAE were attenuated, whereas the increase in CrCl was abolished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>VEGF antibody administration tended to reduce expansion in total mesangial volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These effects in diabetic animals were seen without impact on body weight, blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin levels, or food consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> inhibition of VEGF in db/db mice ameliorates the diabetic renal changes seen in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
