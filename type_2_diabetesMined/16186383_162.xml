<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blockade of the cannabinoid type 1 (CB-1) receptor reduces body weight in animals by central and peripheral actions; the role of the peripheral endocannabinoid system in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> is now being extensively investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We measured circulating endocannabinoid concentrations and studied the expression of CB-1 and the main degrading enzyme, fatty acid <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29337,32988">amide</z:chebi> hydrolase (FAAH), in adipose tissue of lean (n = 20) and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (n = 20) women and after a 5% <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> in a second group of women (n = 17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Circulating levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2700">anandamide</z:chebi> and 1/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52392">2-arachidonoylglycerol</z:chebi> were increased by 35 and 52% in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> compared with lean women (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adipose tissue <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were reduced by -34% for CB-1 and -59% for FAAH in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A strong negative correlation was found between FAAH expression in adipose tissue and circulating endocannabinoids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Circulating endocannabinoids and CB-1 or FAAH expression were not affected by 5% <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The expression of CB-1 and FAAH was increased in mature human adipocytes compared with in preadipocytes and was found in several human tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings support the presence of a peripheral endocannabinoid system that is upregulated in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
