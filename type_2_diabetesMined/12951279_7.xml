<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the relationship between family history and development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by gender in the westernized environment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nine-hundred-and-sixty non-diabetic Japanese-American subjects who underwent the 75 g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test were followed for 6.8+/-0.1 years (mean+/-standard error) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a log-rank test, women with a family history showed a significantly higher incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with those without a family history (P=0.018), whereas men showed no significant difference (P=0.25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a Cox proportional hazards model, the hazard ratio of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in men and women with a positive family history were 1.56 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.81-2.97) and 1.86 (95% CI 1.08-3.19), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This association, which indicated a hazard ratio of 1.79 (95% CI 1.04-3.10), persisted even after adjustment for age, systolic, diastolic blood pressure, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi>, category of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (NGT) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT), body mass index and homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-R) in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that even if lifestyle is westernized, a family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is an important predictor of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> development especially among women in Japanese-American population </plain></SENT>
