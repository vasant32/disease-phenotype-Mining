<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We considered whether cell therapy also might be useful in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011881" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic kidney disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cognizant of the likely need for autologous cell therapy in humans, we sought to assess the efficacy of donor cells derived from both healthy and diabetic animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight-week-old db/db mice were randomized to receive a single intravenous injection of PBS or 0.5 Ã— 10(6) early-outgrowth cells (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EOCs</z:e>) from db/m or db/db mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Effects were assessed 4 weeks after cell infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Untreated db/db mice developed <z:mp ids='MP_0011353'>mesangial matrix expansion</z:mp> and tubular epithelial cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in association with increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and overexpression of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15033">thioredoxin</z:chebi> interacting protein (TxnIP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Without affecting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> or blood pressure, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EOCs</z:e> not only attenuated mesangial and peritubular matrix expansion, as well as tubular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, but also diminished ROS and TxnIP overexpression in the kidney of db/db mice </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The similarly beneficial effects of cells from healthy and diabetic donors highlight the potential of autologous cell therapy in the related clinical setting </plain></SENT>
