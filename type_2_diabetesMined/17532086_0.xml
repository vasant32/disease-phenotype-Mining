<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In distinct from Caucasian populations, Japanese type 2 diabetic patients are divided into two categories: one with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and the other with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This unique feature allows us to explore the factors responsible for the evolution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in Japanese type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this article, we describe the factors responsible for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in Japanese type 2 diabetic patients and discuss the relationships between these factors and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Japanese type 2 diabetic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> had significantly higher concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>, remnant-like particle cholesterol, subcutaneous and visceral abdominal fat areas, leptin, high sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and soluble E-selectin and lower concentration of adiponectin when compared to those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were, however, no significant difference in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF)-alpha and soluble TNF receptors between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> was positively correlated to visceral abdominal fat area, while serum leptin was positively correlated with subcutaneous abdominal fat area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, serum adiponectin was negatively correlated to visceral abdominal fat area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>High sensitive CRP was positively correlated to BMI, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>, and leptin, but was negatively correlated to adiponectin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha and soluble TNF receptors, however, were not associated with any of these factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, it may be hypothesized that Japanese type 2 diabetic patients are divided into two categories: one with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> insulin sensitivity and the other with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The former group has a low <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factor</z:e>, whereas the latter one has a markedly increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> risk factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, abdominal fat related <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> seems to be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in Japanese type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In this section, we would like to focus on the factors contributing to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and discuss the association of these factors with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in Japanese type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
