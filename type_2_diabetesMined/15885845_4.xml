<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To study the long-term (1- and 2-year) effect of a lifestyle intervention on non-diabetic first-degree relatives of type 2 diabetic patients, i.e., the 1-year effect of diet versus diet and exercise in relation to a control group and the 2-year sustainability of these treatment effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Seventy-seven healthy first-degree relatives (men and women) between the ages of 25 and 55 were allocated to one of three groups: diet group (D), diet and exercise group (DE) and control group (C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For ethical reasons, after 1 year the control group began the intervention and were followed for another 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diet and physical activity counselling was based on current nutrition recommendations, including increased intake of fatty fish and low glycaemic index foods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The fatty acid composition of the erythrocyte membrane was studied as an objective measure of dietary change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Assessments included fasting insulin, 2-h insulin, oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT), anthropometry and blood <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Groups D and DE received intensive follow-up through unannounced telephone interviews during the first 4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Dietary changes were significant at 1 year, and to a large degree sustained at 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adherence to advice regarding fat quality was confirmed through changes in the fatty acid composition of the erythrocyte membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The least active subjects in DE increased their physical activity (PA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At 1 year, group D showed a reduction in the ratio of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> to <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (p=0.028) while group DE decreased their body weight by 2.7% (p&lt;0.029) and increased <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> (p&lt;0.037) versus controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At 2 years, cholesterol levels (total, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> and the ratio <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>) were reduced within group D and when compared to DE (p=0.022, 0.009, 0.035, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Fasting insulin was reduced within group DE and when compared to group D (p=0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Positive changes in lifestyle, blood <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and fasting insulin can be achieved and maintained in a non-diabetic population at risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after 2 years </plain></SENT>
