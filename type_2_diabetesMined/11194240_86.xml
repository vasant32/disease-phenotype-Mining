<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Because a pseudonormal pattern of ventricular filling has never been considered in studies that reported a prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1273070" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">left ventricular diastolic dysfunction</z:e> (LVDD) between 20 and 40%, our aim was to more completely evaluate the prevalence of LVDD in subjects with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 46 men with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were aged 38-67 years; without evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, or thyroid or overt <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal disease</z:e>; and with a maximal treadmill exercise test showing no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>LVDD was evaluated by Doppler echocardiography, which included the use of the Valsalva maneuver and pulmonary venous recordings to unmask a pseudonormal pattern of left ventricular filling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: LVDD was found in 28 subjects (60%), of whom 13 (28%) had a pseudonormal pattern of ventricular filling and 15 (32%) had impaired relaxation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Systolic function was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects, and there was no correlation between LVDD and indexes of metabolic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LVDD is much more common than previously reported in subjects with well-controlled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who are free of clinically detectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The high prevalence of this phenomenon in this high-risk population suggests that screening for LVDD in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> should include procedures such as the Valsalva maneuver and pulmonary venous recordings to unmask a pseudonormal pattern of ventricular filling </plain></SENT>
