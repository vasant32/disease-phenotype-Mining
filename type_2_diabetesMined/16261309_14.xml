<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: GFR was measured in 662 type 2 diabetic patients by plasma disappearance of 99 m-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33353">technetium</z:chebi>-diethylene-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="38751">triamine</z:chebi>-penta-<z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of hyperfiltration was calculated using both an age-unadjusted GFR threshold of &gt;130 ml min(-1) 1.73 m(-2) and an age-adjusted threshold incorporating a decline of 1 ml min(-1) year(-1) after the age of 40 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The hyperfiltering patients were compared with type 2 diabetic subjects who had a GFR between 90 and 130 ml min(-1) 1.73 m(-2) and were matched for age, sex and disease duration to allow for identification of modifiable factors associated with hyperfiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of hyperfiltration was 7.4% when age-unadjusted and 16.6% when age-adjusted definitions were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The age-unadjusted vs -adjusted prevalence rates for hyperfiltration were 50 vs 50%, 12.9 vs 23.4% and 0.3 vs 9.0% for patients aged &lt;40 years, 40 to 65 years and &gt;65 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both the age-unadjusted and -adjusted hyperfiltration groups had lower mean diastolic blood pressure and lower serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> levels than the control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although the age-unadjusted hyperfiltration group had larger kidneys compared to the control group, this difference was no longer significant when the age-adjusted definition was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in HbA(1)c, mean arterial pressure, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> use, insulin therapy, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidaemia</z:e>, frequency of macro- or microvascular complications, BMI, urinary <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> and albumin excretion between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Hyperfiltration was still more common among younger patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> even after adjusting for the expected age-related decline in GFR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Hyperfiltration was associated with a lower mean diastolic blood pressure independent of age </plain></SENT>
