<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Six MODY genes have been discovered to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To identify additional MODY loci, we conducted a genome scan in 21 extended U.S. families (15 white and 6 from minorities, for a total of 237 individuals) in which MODY was not caused by known MODY genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven chromosomal regions (1q42, 2q24, 2q37, 4p13, 8p23, 11p15, and 19q12) had a parametric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> logarithm of odds (HLOD) &gt; or =1.00 or a nonparametric logarithm of odds (LOD) &gt; or =0.59 (P &lt; or = 0.05) in the initial screen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After typing additional markers at these loci to reduce the spacing to 2-3 cM, significant linkage was detected on 8p23 (HLOD = 3.37 at D8S1130 and nonparametric LOD = 3.66; P = 2 x 10(-5) at D8S265), where a 4.7-Mb inversion polymorphism is located </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty percent of the families (6 of 21) were linked with this region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Another linkage peak on chromosome 2q37 with an HLOD of 1.96 at D2S345/D2S2968 accounted for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in an additional 25% of families (5 of 21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 6 minority families were among the 11 families linked to these loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the other loci followed up had an HLOD exceeding 1.50 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In summary, we have identified a MODY locus on 8p23 that accounts for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a substantial proportion of MODY cases unlinked to known MODY genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Another novel MODY locus may be present on 2q37 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cloning these new MODY genes may offer insights to disease pathways that are relevant to the cause of common type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
