<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Scale development was based on principal component analyses in two cross-sectional studies of insulin-na√Øve patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The structure of the questionnaire was developed in the first sample of 448 patients and subsequently cross-validated in an independent sample of 449 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Analyses in the first sample yielded five components that accounted for 74.5% of the variance based on 14 items and led to the following subscales: fear of injection and self-testing, expectations regarding positive insulin-related outcomes, expected hardship from insulin treatment, stigmatization by insulin injections, and fear of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, an overall sum score of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> values was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The structure of the questionnaire was cross-validated in the second sample, with almost identical component loadings and an explained variance of 69.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An additional confirmatory factor analysis also indicated an acceptable to good model fit with root mean square error of approximation equal to 0.04 and comparative fit index equal to 0.97 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Coefficients of reliability (Cronbach's alpha 0.62-0.85 and 0.78 for overall sum score) were acceptable, considering the very small number of items for each scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The Barriers to Insulin Treatment Questionnaire appears to be a reliable and valid measure of psychological <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This short instrument is easy to administer and may be used by both clinicians and researchers to assess the psychological barriers to insulin treatment </plain></SENT>
