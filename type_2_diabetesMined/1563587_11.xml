<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fasting islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> concentrations were similar in control subjects, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-tolerant and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-intolerant relatives (8 +/- 1, 9 +/- 1 and 11 +/- 2 fmol/ml; p = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The area under the islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> curve measured during an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> load was larger in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-intolerant relatives (115 +/- 13 fmol/ml) compared to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerant relatives and control subjects (88 +/- 3 and 79 +/- 12 fmol/ml; p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The insulin response during the oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> load was inversely correlated with the rate of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal measured during a euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp (r = -0.725; p less than 0.01), while no significant correlation was observed between the corresponding values for islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal (r = -0.380; p = NS) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since these patients are characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and abnormal first-phase insulin secretion, the putative role of islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> in the development of these abnormalities remains to be established </plain></SENT>
