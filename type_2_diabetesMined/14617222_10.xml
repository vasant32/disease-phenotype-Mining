<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The main aim of treatment of type 2 diabetic patients is to control plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and HbA1c levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we aimed to assess the effects of three different insulin regimens (group I: lispro insulin + <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin, group II: lispro insulin + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and group III: regular insulin + <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin) on overall glycaemic control and metabolic parameters in type 2 diabetic patients with secondary oral anti-diabetic drug failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty type 2 diabetic patients with secondary OAD failure were randomly allocated into three different treatment groups equally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between groups concerning age, body mass index, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration, HbA1c and serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels at the beginning of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the 6-month treatment period, blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were determined 10 times during 24 h at pre-meal, post-prandial 1 and 2 h and at bedtime </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Group I was found to be the most effective treatment regimen in controlling HbA1c levels (group I vs. group II, p = 0.013; group I vs. group III, p = 0.001; group II vs. group III, p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When the comparison was made in each group, change in HbA1c was statistically significant for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups (-3.18%, p = 0.001; -2.02%, p = 0.043 and -2.66%, p = 0.008 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Group I was found to be more effective in controlling fasting and post-prandial plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels measured at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> times during the day when compared with group II and group III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In group II <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels were found to be significantly reduced, whereas other groups had no effect on <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No serious <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0745153" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemic episodes</z:e> were observed in any of the cases, whereas in group I <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0745153" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemic episode</z:e> rates were increased (chi2 = 8.843, p = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Lispro insulin plus <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin regimen is more effective in controlling both pre- and post-prandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels and HbA1c when compared to regular insulin plus <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Mealtime lispro insulin plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> combination therapy should also be seriously considered as an effective and alternative treatment regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It is worthy of attention that insulin lispro plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> lowered <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
