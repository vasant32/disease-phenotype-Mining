<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The recent development of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> (TZDs) as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">insulin sensitizers</z:chebi> presents a new line of therapy for the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In animal studies, TZDs increase body weight largely due to increased fat pad mass and alterations in adipocyte size and numbers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Accumulating evidence indicates that ghrelin plays a role in regulating food intake and energy homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined whether oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> administration regulates plasma ghrelin concentration and body weights using <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> fatty rats (ZFR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ZFRs were administered <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> orally (20mg/kg/day) for 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Food consumption in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>-treated group (ZFR/PIO (+)) was significantly greater than that of the control group (ZFR/PIO (-)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Body weight of the ZFR/PIO (+) was also significantly greater than that of the ZFR/PIO (-) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ZFR/PIO (+) exhibited a significant increase in whole body energy expenditure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fasting plasma ghrelin concentration in the ZFR/PIO (+) was significantly lower than that in the ZFR/PIO (-) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that increase in food consumption by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> is not associated with fasting plasma ghrelin and that ghrelin secretion is down-regulated under positive energy balance in rats </plain></SENT>
