<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We recently reported the association between skin autofluorescence, as a measure of tissue AGE accumulation, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011882" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic neuropathy</z:e> in a selected diabetic population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the relation between skin autofluorescence and clinical variables including micro- and macrovascular complications in a type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> primary care population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Clinical data and skin autofluorescence were obtained in the type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> group (n = 973) and in a control group (n = 231) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Skin autofluorescence was assessed by illumination of the lower arm with a fluorescent tube (peak intensity approximately 370 nm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Skin autofluorescence was significantly higher in type 2 diabetic patients compared with control subjects in each age category </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multiple regression analysis showed significant correlation of skin autofluorescence with age, sex, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration, BMI, smoking, HbA1c, plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, and albumin-to-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio in the type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> group (R2 = 25%) and with age and smoking in the control group (R2 = 46%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Skin autofluorescence was significantly higher in the type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> group, with both micro- and macrovascular disease, compared with the group without complications and the group with only microvascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms in a large group of type 2 diabetic patients that skin autofluorescence is higher compared with age-matched control subjects and is associated with the severity of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Skin autofluorescence reflecting vascular damage might be a rapid and helpful tool in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> outpatient clinic for identifying diabetic patients who are at risk for developing complications </plain></SENT>
