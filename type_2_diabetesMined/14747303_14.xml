<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have identified a region on chromosome 1q21-q24 that was significantly linked to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in multiplex families of Northern European ancestry and also in Pima Indians, Amish families, and families from France and England </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to narrow and map this locus using a combination of linkage and association approaches by typing microsatellite markers at 1.2 and 0.5 cM densities, respectively, over a region of 37 cM (23.5 Mb) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We tested linkage by parametric and nonparametric approaches and association using both case-control and family-based methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the 40 multiplex families that provided the previous evidence for linkage, the highest parametric, recessive logarithm of odds (LOD) score was 5.29 at marker D1S484 (168.5 cM, 157.5 Mb) without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nonparametric linkage (NPL) statistics (P = 0.00009), SimWalk2 Statistic A (P = 0.0002), and sib-pair analyses (maximum likelihood score = 6.07) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> mapped to the same location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The one LOD CI was narrowed to 156.8-158.9 Mb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Under recessive, two-point linkage analysis, adjacent markers D1S2675 (171.5 cM, 158.9 Mb) and D1S1679 (172 cM, 159.1 Mb) showed LOD scores &gt;3.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nonparametric analyses revealed a second linkage peak at 180 cM near marker D1S1158 (163.3 Mb, NPL score 3.88, P = 0.0001), which was also supported by case-control (marker D1S194, 178 cM, 162.1 Mb; P = 0.003) and family-based (marker ATA38A05, 179 cM, 162.5 Mb; P = 0.002) association studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We propose that the replicated linkage findings actually encompass at least two closely spaced regions, with a second susceptibility region located telomeric at 162.5-164.7 Mb </plain></SENT>
