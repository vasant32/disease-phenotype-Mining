<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Homozygous G(M)(-/-) mice show <z:mp ids='MP_0001260'>increased weight</z:mp> gain after 3 months of age and become <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, weighing approximately 20% more than their <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) littermates after 12 months of age </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The massive abdominal and other fat depositions observed at this age are likely to be a consequence of impaired blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization in skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PP1-G(M) activity, assayed after specific immunoadsorption, was absent from G(M)(-/-) mice and stimulated in the hind limb muscles of WT mice by intravenous infusion of insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PP1-R5/PTG, another <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> targeted form of PP1, was not significantly stimulated by insulin in the skeletal muscle of WT mice but showed compensatory stimulation by insulin in G(M)(-/-) mice </plain></SENT>
