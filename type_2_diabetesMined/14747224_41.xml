<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed data on depressive symptoms (including recent <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002360'>sleep disturbance</z:hpo>, feelings of hopelessness, loss of libido, and increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0000737'>irritability</z:hpo>) in a longitudinal, biracial cohort study of 11,615 initially nondiabetic adults aged 48-67 years, who were subsequently followed for 6 years for the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, depressive symptoms were positively associated with BMI, fasting insulin, systolic blood pressure, caloric intake, physical inactivity, and current smoking (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In prospective analyses, after adjusting for age, race, sex, and education, individuals in the highest quartile of depressive symptoms had a 63% increased risk of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with those in the lowest quartile (relative hazard [RH] 1.63, 95% CI 1.31-2.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This relation persisted after adjustment for stress-associated lifestyle factors (smoking, physical activity, caloric intake, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e>) (1.28, 1.02-1.60) and metabolic covariates (fasting insulin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, blood pressure, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e>) (1.38, 1.10-1.73) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort, depressive symptoms predicted incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This relation is only partially explained by demographic, metabolic, and lifestyle factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Possible neuroendocrine mediators of the stress-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> relationship require further evaluation in prospective cohort studies that use an established tool to assess <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and incorporate neurohormonal measurements </plain></SENT>
