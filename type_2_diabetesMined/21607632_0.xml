<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Inpatient costs for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Scotland were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Scottish Care Information-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Collaboration (SCI-DC), a real-time clinical information system of almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> diagnosed cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Scotland, UK, was linked to data on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> hospital admissions for people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Inpatient stay costs were estimated using the 2007-2008 Scottish National Tariff </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The probability of hospital admission and total annual cost of admissions were estimated in relation to age, sex, type of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, history of vascular admission, HbA(1c), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, body mass index and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In Scotland during 2005-2007, 24,750 people with type 1 and 195,433 people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were identified, accounting for approximately 4.3% of the total Scottish population (5.1 million) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The estimated total annual cost of admissions for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> people diagnosed with type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was £26 million and £275 million, respectively, approximately 12% of the total Scottish inpatient expenditure (£2.4 billion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sex, increasing age, serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, previous vascular history and HbA(1c) (the latter differentially in type 1 and type 2) were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> associated with likelihood and total annual cost of admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> inpatient expenditure accounted for 12% of the total Scottish inpatient expenditure, whilst people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> account for 4.3% of the population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the modifiable risk factors, HbA(1c) was the most important driver of cost in type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
