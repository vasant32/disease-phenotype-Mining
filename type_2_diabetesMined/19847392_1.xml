<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, this association did not achieve genome-wide levels of significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to establish the true contribution of this variant and common variants in LARS2 (MAF &gt; 5%) to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We combined genome-wide association data (n = 10,128) from the DIAGRAM consortium with independent data derived from a tagging single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) approach in Dutch individuals (n = 999) and took forward two SNPs of interest to replication in up to 11,163 Dutch participants (rs17637703 and rs952621) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, because inspection of genome-wide association study data identified a cluster of low-frequency variants with evidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> association, we attempted replication of rs9825041 (a proxy for this group) and the previously identified H324Q variant in up to 35,715 participants of European descent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No association between the common SNPs in LARS2 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our replication studies for the two low-frequency variants, rs9825041 and H324Q, failed to confirm an association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Dutch, Scandinavian and UK samples (OR 1.03 [95% CI 0.95-1.12], p = 0.45, n = 31,962 and OR 0.99 [0.90-1.08], p = 0.78, n = 35,715 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In this study, the largest study examining the role of sequence variants in LARS2 in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility, we found no evidence to support previous data indicating a role in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility </plain></SENT>
