<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether eGFRcys are superior to eGFRcre in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: GFR was measured in 448 type 2 diabetic patients using (51)Cr-EDTA-measured GFR (mGFR) as the reference standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bias, precision and accuracy of eGFRcys and eGFRcre were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The most accurate eGFRcre equation (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Kidney Disease</z:e> Epidemiology Collaboration [CKD-EPI]), which produced the highest proportion of estimates that were within 30% and 10% of the reference standard (80.7% and 38.0% of samples, respectively) had a bias of 7.1 and precision of 12.0 ml min(-1) 1.73 m(-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The calibrated eGFRcys with the highest accuracy (Tan-C), which produced the highest proportion of estimates that were within 30% (78.8%) and within 10% (39.0%) of the reference standard had a bias of -3.5 and precision of 18.0 ml min(-1) 1.73 m(-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the areas under the receiver operating curve were higher with eGFRcre (CKD-EPI and Modification of Diet in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Renal Disease</z:e> [MDRD]) than with eGFRcys for the diagnosis of mild (mGFR &lt;90 ml min(-1) 1.73 m(-2)) and moderate (mGFR &lt;60 ml min(-1) 1.73 m(-2)) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with mGFR â‰¥90 ml min(-1) 1.73 m(-2), CKD-EPI was the least biased, the most precise and the most accurate equation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, eGFRcys do not currently provide better eGFR than eGFRcre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At present, compared with eGFRcys, eGFRcre are better at predicting the stage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, CKD-EPI seems to be the best equation for eGFR in patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> renal function </plain></SENT>
