<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Peak exercise capacity expressed as METs and estimated from treadmill speed and grade was measured during a graded exercise test designed to elicit a maximal effort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Other measures included waist circumference, BMI, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration, types of medication used, A1C, history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e>, beta-blocker use, and race/ethnicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Peak exercise capacity was higher for men (8.0 +/- 2.1 METs) than for women (6.7 +/- 1.7 METs) (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Exercise capacity also decreased across each decade of age (P &lt; 0.001) and with increasing BMI and waist circumference levels in both sexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Older age, increased waist circumference and BMI, a longer duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, increased A1C, a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e>, beta-blocker use, and being African American compared with being Caucasian were associated with a lower peak exercise capacity for both sexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> and use of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> medications were associated with lower peak exercise capacity in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who are overweight or <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> have impaired exercise capacity, which is primarily related to age, female sex, and race, as well as poor metabolic control, BMI, and central <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
