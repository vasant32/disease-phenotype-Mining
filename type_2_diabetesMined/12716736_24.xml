<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this condition, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi> production is increased and resistant to suppressive effects of insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The relationships between hepatic FA metabolism, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>steatosis</z:hpo>, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi> production are incompletely understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47776">VLDL-triglyceride</z:chebi> and -<z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> (apo)-B production in relation to DNL and insulin sensitivity in female ob/ob mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hepatic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> (5-fold) and cholesteryl <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> (15-fold) contents were increased in ob/ob mice compared with lean controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hepatic DNL was increased approximately 10-fold in ob/ob mice, whereas hepatic cholesterol synthesis was not affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Basal rates of hepatic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47776">VLDL-triglyceride</z:chebi> and -apoB100 production were similar between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hyperinsulinemic clamping reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47776">VLDL-triglyceride</z:chebi> and -apoB100 production rates by approximately 60% and approximately 75%, respectively, in lean mice but only by approximately 20% and approximately 20%, respectively, in ob/ob mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No differences in hepatic expression of genes encoding apoB and microsomal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> transfer protein were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hepatic expression and protein phosphorylation of insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate isoforms were reduced in ob/ob mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, strongly induced hepatic DNL is not associated with increased <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi> production in ob/ob mice, possibly related to differential hepatic zonation of apoB synthesis (periportal) and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> accumulation (perivenous) and/or relatively low rates of cholesterogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Insulin is unable to effectively suppress <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47776">VLDL-triglyceride</z:chebi> production in ob/ob mice, presumably because of impaired insulin signaling </plain></SENT>
