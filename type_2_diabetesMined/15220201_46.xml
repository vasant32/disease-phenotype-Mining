<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The majority of previous factor analyses, however, have used only surrogate measures of insulin sensitivity; very few have included nontraditional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) risk factors such as plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1, fibrinogen, and C-reactive protein (CRP); and only a limited number have assessed the ability of factors to predict type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to investigate, using factor analysis, the clustering of metabolic and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> variables using data from 1,087 nondiabetic participants in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin Resistance</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Study (IRAS) and to determine the association of these clusters with risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study includes information on directly measured insulin sensitivity (S(i)) from the frequently sampled intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test among African-American, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic white subjects aged 40-69 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Principal factor analysis of data from nondiabetic subjects at baseline (1992-1994) identified three factors, which explained 28.4, 7.4, and 6% of the total variance in the dataset, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on factor loadings of &gt;or= 0.40, these factors were interpreted as 1) a "metabolic" factor, with positive loadings of BMI, waist circumference, 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, log <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>, and log PAI-1 and inverse loadings of log S(i) + 1 and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>; 2) an "<z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>" factor, with positive loadings of BMI, waist circumference, fibrinogen, and log CRP and an inverse loading of log S(i) + 1; and 3) a "blood pressure" factor, with positive loadings of systolic and diastolic blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results were similar within strata of ethnicity, and there were only subtle differences in sex-specific analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a prospective analysis, each of the factors was a significant predictor of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after a median follow-up period of 5.2 years, and each factor remained significant in a multivariate model that included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three factors, although this three-factor model was not significantly more predictive than models using either <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> or conventional <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Factor analysis identified three underlying factors among a group of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> variables, with insulin sensitivity loading on both the metabolic and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> variable clusters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Each factor significantly predicted <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The findings support the emerging hypothesis that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> subclinical <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and comprises a component of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
