<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-nine <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> received low-fat or low-GL dietary instruction, delivered in 40-week lifestyle modification programs with identical goals for calorie intake and physical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Changes in weight, HbA(1c), and other metabolic parameters were compared at weeks 20 and 40 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>Weight loss</z:hpo> did not differ between groups at week 20 (low-fat: -5.7±3.7%; low-GL: -6.7±4.4%, p=.26) or week 40 (low-fat: -4.5±7.5%; low-GL: -6.4±8.2%, p=.28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adjusting for changes in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> medications, subjects on the low-GL diet had larger reductions in HbA(1c) than those on the low-fat diet at week 20 (low-fat: -0.3±0.6%; low-GL: -0.7±0.6%, p=.01), and week 40 (low-fat: -0.1±1.2%; low-GL: -0.8±1.3%; p=.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Groups did not differ significantly on any other metabolic outcomes (p≥.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that targeting GL, rather than dietary fat, in a low-calorie diet can significantly enhance the effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> on HbA(1c) in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
