<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A controlled cross-sectional study with the aim of studying oral health in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was carried out in a health care district in Sweden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study included 102 randomly sampled diabetic patients and 102 age- and gender-matched non-diabetic subjects from the same geographical area, treated at the same Public Dental Service clinics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Oral conditions were measured at clinical and X-ray examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp>-related variables were extracted from medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diabetic patients suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000217'>xerostomia</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000217'>dry mouth</z:hpo>) to a significantly higher degree than non-diabetic controls did (53.5 vs. 28.4%; P=0.0003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sites with advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000704'>periodontitis</z:hpo> were more frequent in the diabetic group (P=0.006) as were initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000670'>caries</z:hpo> lesions (P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Diabetic subjects showed a greater need of periodontal treatment (P=0.05), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000670'>caries</z:hpo> prevention (P=0.002) and prosthetic corrections (P=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> duration or metabolic control of the disease was not related to periodontal status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, patients with longer duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had more manifest <z:hpo ids='HP_0000670'>caries</z:hpo> lesions (P=0.05) as had those on insulin treatment when compared with patients on oral/diet or combined treatment (P=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The conclusion is that individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in some oral conditions exhibited poorer health </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Close collaboration between the patient, the primary health care and oral health professionals could be a way of improving the diabetic patient's general and oral health </plain></SENT>
