<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is not known whether TCF7L2 variation increases the risk of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using a case-control design, we examined whether the reported variants [rs12255372 (T/G) and rs7903146 (T/C)] are associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in SEARCH for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> in Youth study participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Variants were genotyped in 694 non-Hispanic white (NHW) youth (86 cases, mean age 15.5 years, mean BMI 34.8; and 608 controls, mean age 14.4 years, mean BMI 22.3) and 545 African-American (AA) youth (154 cases, mean age 15.9, mean BMI 37; and 391 controls, mean age 14.8, mean BMI 23.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression adjusted for age, sex, BMI and West African ancestry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The association of the risk T allele with case/control status was different in AA and NHW youth (p = 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among AA youth, each copy of the T allele (rs7903146) was associated with a 1.97-fold (1.37, 2.82) increased odds for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (p &lt; 0.0001), after adjustment for age, sex, BMI and African ancestry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant association was detected in NHW youth (adjusted OR, 1.14; 0.73, 1.79) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: TCF7L2 variation is associated with an increased risk of early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among AA youth, and the association appears to be stronger in AA than NHW youth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This suggests potential different contributions of genetic and environmental factors to early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by race </plain></SENT>
