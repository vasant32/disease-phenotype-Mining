<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study evaluates the hypothesis that lactogens can protect beta cells against GLT and examines the mechanism behind the pro-survival effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The effect of exogenous treatment or endogenous expression of lactogens on GLT-induced beta cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was examined in INS-1 cells, and in rodent and human islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mechanism behind the pro-survival effect of lactogens was determined using an inhibitor, siRNAs, a dominant negative (DN) mutant, and Cre-lox-mediated gene deletion analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Lactogens significantly protect INS-1 and primary rodent beta cells against GLT-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pro-survival effect of lactogens in rodent beta cells is mediated through activation of the Janus kinase-2 (JAK2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription-5 (STAT5) signalling pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lactogen-induced increase in the anti-apoptotic B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-extra large (BCLXL) protein is required to mediate its pro-survival effects in both INS-1 cells and primary rodent beta cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most importantly, lactogens significantly protect human beta cells against GLT-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and their pro-survival effect is also mediated through the JAK2/STAT5 pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These studies, together with previous work, clearly demonstrate the pro-survival nature of lactogens and identify the JAK2/STAT5 pathway as an important mediator of this effect in both rodent and human beta cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Future studies will determine the effectiveness of this <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> in vivo in the pathophysiology of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
