<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: People with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are at increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> but the mechanism is uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Elevated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> levels in rodents and humans are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine whether fasting <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> levels are associated with cognitive ability and estimated lifetime <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1392786" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive change</z:e> in an elderly population with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of 1,066 men and women aged 60-75 years with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, living in Lothian, Scotland (the Edinburgh Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cognitive abilities in memory, nonverbal reasoning, information processing speed, executive function, and mental flexibility were tested, and a general cognitive ability factor, g, was derived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prior intelligence was estimated from vocabulary testing, and adjustment for scores on this test was used to estimate lifetime <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1392786" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive change</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Relationships between fasting morning plasma <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> levels and cognitive ability and estimated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1392786" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive change</z:e> were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Models were adjusted for potential confounding and/or mediating variables including metabolic and cardiovascular variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In age-adjusted analyses, higher fasting <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> levels were not associated with current g or with performance in individual cognitive domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, higher fasting <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> levels were associated with greater estimated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> in g and in tests of working memory and processing speed, independent of mood, education, metabolic variables, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High morning <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> levels in elderly people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are associated with estimated age-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1392786" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive change</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Strategies targeted at lowering <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> action may be useful in ameliorating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> in individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
