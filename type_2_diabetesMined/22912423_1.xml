<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess whether the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002870'>obstructive sleep apnea</z:hpo> (OSA) affects <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in young, lean individuals who are healthy and free of cardiometabolic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a prospective design, 52 healthy men (age 18-30 years; BMI 18-25 kg/m(2)) underwent laboratory polysomnogram followed by a morning oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We stratified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects according to the presence or absence of ethnicity-based <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk and family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We then used a frequency-matching approach and randomly selected individuals without OSA, yielding a total of 20 control men without OSA and 12 men with OSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Indices of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and insulin secretion (early phase and total) were compared between men with OSA and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incremental areas under the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (incAUC(glu)) and insulin (incAUC(ins)) curves were calculated using the trapezoidal method from 0 to 120 min during the OGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Men with OSA and control subjects were similar in terms of age, BMI, ethnicity-based <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk, family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and level of exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both groups had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> systolic and diastolic blood pressure and fasting <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After ingestion of a <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> load, men with OSA had 27% lower insulin sensitivity (estimated by Matsuda index) and 37% higher total insulin secretion (incAUC(ins)) than the control subjects, despite comparable <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels (incAUC(glu)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In young, lean, and healthy men who are free of cardiometabolic disease, the presence of OSA is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and a compensatory rise in insulin secretion to maintain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, OSA may increase the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> independently of traditional cardiometabolic risk factors </plain></SENT>
