<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The role of TNF-alpha in <z:mp ids='MP_0001792'>impaired wound healing</z:mp> in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was examined by focusing on fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Small excisional wounds were created in the db/db mice model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and normoglycaemic littermates, and in a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi>-induced type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> mouse model and control mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fibroblast <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was measured by the TUNEL assay, proliferation by detection of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) activity by DNA binding and nuclear translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TNF-alpha was specifically inhibited by pegsunercept </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Diabetic wounds had increased TNF-alpha, fibroblast <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, caspase-3/7 activity and activation of the pro-apoptotic transcription factor FOXO1, and decreased proliferating cell nuclear antigen positive fibroblasts (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TNF-alpha inhibition improved healing in the diabetic mice and increased fibroblast density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This may be explained by a decrease in fibroblast <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and increased proliferation when TNF-alpha was blocked (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although <z:mp ids='MP_0011704'>decreased fibroblast proliferation</z:mp> and enhanced FOXO1 activity were investigated in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, they may also be implicated in type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In vitro, TNF-alpha enhanced <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of gene sets related to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and Akt and p53 but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> or cell-cycle pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>FOXO1 small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> reduced gene sets that regulate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, Akt, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> and cell-cycle pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>TNF-alpha also increased genes involved in <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, cytokine, Toll-like receptor and nuclear factor-kB pathways, which were significantly reduced by FOXO1 knockdown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These studies indicate that TNF-alpha dysregulation in diabetic wounds impairs healing, which may involve enhanced fibroblast <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and decreased proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In vitro, TNF-alpha induced gene sets through FOXO1 that regulate a number of pathways that could influence <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
