<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-seven (49 male, 28 female) FDR were allocated to one of three groups, diet (D-group; n = 25), diet and exercise (DE-group; n = 30) or control group (C-group; n = 22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lifestyle counselling was based on current nutrition recommendations, including increased intake of fatty fish and low glycaemic index foods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Group counselling was given on two occasions with follow-up through telephone interviews every 10 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Assessments included insulin sensitivity index (Si), anthropometry, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> parameters, circulating leptin and adiponectin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The D-group reduced total cholesterol (-0.31 mmol/l, P = 0.024), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (-0.22 mmol/l, P = 0.021) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B (-9.5 mg/dl, P = 0.009) levels, whereas the DE-group <z:hpo ids='HP_0004325'>decreased body weight</z:hpo> (-2.1%, P = 0.030) and waist circumference (-3.0 cm, P &lt; 0.001) versus controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A 13% reduction in fasting insulin was observed in the DE-group, but no significant improvement in Si in D-group or DE-group was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A subgroup, adherent to diet and who increased exercise, significantly improved Si and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The improved metabolic risk profile in FDR suggests that lifestyle changes can be effective in individuals at high risk to develop type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
