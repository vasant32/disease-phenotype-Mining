<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is well recognized that the agouti/melanocortin system is an important regulator of body weight homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Given that agouti is expressed in human adipose tissue and that the ectopic expression of agouti in adipose tissue results in moderately <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> mice, the link between agouti expression in human adipose tissue and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>/type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although there was no apparent relationship between agouti <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels and BMI, agouti <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were significantly elevated in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The regulation of agouti in cultured human adipocytes revealed that insulin did not regulate agouti <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, whereas <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> treatment potently increased the levels of agouti <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Experiments with cultured human preadipocytes and with cells obtained from transgenic mice that overexpress agouti demonstrated that melanocortin receptor (MCR) signaling in adipose tissue can regulate both preadipocyte proliferation and differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results reveal that agouti can regulate adipogenesis at several levels and suggest that there are functional consequences of elevated agouti levels in human adipose tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The influence of MCR signaling on adipogenesis combined with the well-established role of MCR signaling in the hypothalamus suggest that adipogenesis is coordinately regulated with food intake and energy expenditure </plain></SENT>
