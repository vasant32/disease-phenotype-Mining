<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: FOXC2 has lately been implicated in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> function and biogenesis and also as a regulator of mtTFA/Tfam </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the expression of FOXC2 and selected genes involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> function and biogenesis in healthy subjects and in a matched cohort with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients before and after treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Quantitative real time PCR was used to analyze both <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and DNA from biopsies from subcutaneous adipose tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Blood samples and subcutaneous abdominal fat biopsies were collected from 12 T2D patients, of which 11 concluded the study, pre-treatment and 90 days after initiation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> treatment, and from 19 healthy control subjects on the first and only visit from healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical parameters were measured on the blood samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and DNA were prepared from the fat biopsies and gene expression was measured with real time PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The expression level of genes in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> respiratory complexes I - IV were significantly downregulated in the diabetic patients and restored in response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">Rosiglitazone</z:chebi> treatment also increased the relative number of mitochondria in diabetic patients compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the transcription factors FOXC2 and mtTFA/Tfam displayed a response pattern identical to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: FOXC2, mtTFA/Tfam and subunits of the respiratory complexes I - IV show equivalent regulation in gene expression levels in response to TZD treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This, together with the knowledge that FOXC2 has a regulatory function of mtTFA/Tfam and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> biogenesis, suggests that FOXC2 has a possible functional role in the TZD activated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> response </plain></SENT>
