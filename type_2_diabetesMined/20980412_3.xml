<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 522 subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) were randomized into the control (n = 257) and intervention (n = 265) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up was 6.2 years (median 7 years), and the lifestyle intervention, aimed at weight reduction, healthy diet, and increased physical activity, lasted for 4 years (range 1-6 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) and assessment of basic clinical variables were performed annually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The effect of intervention on the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was almost similar in subjects with FH+ compared with subjects with a negative family history (FH-) of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during the entire follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the Cox model, including FH, genetic risk SNPs, and randomization group, and adjusted for the effects of age, sex, BMI, and study center, only lifestyle intervention had a significant effect (hazard ratio 0.55, 95% CI 0.41-0.75, P &lt; 0.001) on the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further analyses showed that in addition to the baseline <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin values, 1-year changes in 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and 2-h insulin achieved by lifestyle intervention had a significant effect on the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results emphasize the effectiveness of lifestyle intervention in reducing the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in high-risk individuals independently of genetic or familial risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
