<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The association of plasma chemerin levels with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, however, is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this study aims to determine whether plasma chemerin levels are associated with renal function in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 116 type 2 diabetic patients and 38 healthy subjects were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of chemerin were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum chemerin was significantly elevated in type 2 diabetic patients with macroalbuminuria compared with control subjects and diabetic patients with normoalbuminuria and <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No differences were found in the level of serum chemerin between diabetic patients with normoalbuminuria and <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum chemerin was positively correlated with age, body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure (SBP), C-reactive protein (CRP), blood <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> nitrogen (BUN), serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> and serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, and negatively correlated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance Stepwise regression analysis showed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance and serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> remained significantly associated with serum chemerin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Serum chemerin levels are strongly associated with renal function in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
