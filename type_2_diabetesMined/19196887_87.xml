<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Preclinical studies with exenatide have suggested sustained improvements in beta-cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effects of 52 weeks of treatment with exenatide or insulin glargine followed by an off-drug period on hyperglycemic clamp-derived measures of beta-cell function, glycemic control, and body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Sixty-nine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>-treated patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were randomly assigned to exenatide (n = 36) or insulin glargine (n = 33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>beta-Cell function was measured during an arginine-stimulated hyperglycemic clamp at week 0, at week 52, and after a 4-week off-drug period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additional end points included effects on glycemic control, body weight, and safety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treatment-induced change in combined <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>- and arginine-stimulated C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> secretion was 2.46-fold (95% CI 2.09-2.90, P &lt; 0.0001) greater after a 52-week exenatide treatment compared with insulin glargine treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both exenatide and insulin glargine reduced A1C similarly: -0.8 +/- 0.1 and -0.7 +/- 0.2%, respectively (P = 0.55) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Exenatide <z:mp ids='MP_0001262'>reduced body weight</z:mp> compared with insulin glargine (difference -4.6 kg, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>beta-Cell function measures returned to pretreatment values in both groups after a 4-week off-drug period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A1C and body weight rose to pretreatment values 12 weeks after discontinuation of either exenatide or insulin glargine therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Exenatide significantly improves beta-cell function during 1 year of treatment compared with titrated insulin glargine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After cessation of both exenatide and insulin glargine therapy, beta-cell function and glycemic control returned to pretreatment values, suggesting that ongoing treatment is necessary to maintain the beneficial effects of either therapy </plain></SENT>
