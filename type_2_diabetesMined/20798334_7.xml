<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A considerable homology exists between the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> and cerebral microcirculations; a hypothesized association between diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (DR) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> was examined in older people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In the population-based Edinburgh Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study, 1,046 men and women aged 60-75 years with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> underwent standard seven-field binocular digital <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> photography and a battery of seven cognitive function tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A general cognitive ability score (g) was generated by principal components analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Mill-Hill Vocabulary Scale was used to estimate premorbid cognitive ability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DR was graded using a modification of the Early Treatment of Diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>Retinopathy</z:hpo> Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After age and sex adjustment, a significant relationship was observed with increasing severity of DR (none, mild, and moderate to severe) for most cognitive measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Participants with moderate-to-severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> had the worst g and the worst performances on the individual tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a significant interaction between sex and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> for g </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In male subjects, the associations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> with g (and with tests of verbal fluency, mental flexibility, and processing speed but not memory and nonverbal reasoning) persisted (P &lt; 0.05) when further adjusted for vocabulary (to estimate lifetime <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, sociodemographic characteristics, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, and macrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: DR was independently associated with estimated lifetime <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> in older men with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, supporting the hypothesis that cerebral microvascular disease may contribute to their observed accelerated age-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A sex interaction with stronger findings in men requires further confirmation </plain></SENT>
