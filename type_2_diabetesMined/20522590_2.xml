<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: MBL2 encodes the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi>-binding lectin, which is a key player in the innate immune system and has recently been found to play a role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and development of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> mellitus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To assess the role of MBL2 in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility, this gene was analyzed in the Pima Indian population, which has a high prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Nineteen tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in a population-based sample of 3,501 full-heritage Pima Indians, and selected SNPs were further genotyped in independent samples of Native American (n = 3,723) and Old Order Amish (n = 486) subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two variants, a promoter SNP (rs11003125) at -550 bp with a risk allele frequency of 0.77 and a Gly54Asp (rs1800450) with a risk allele frequency of 0.83, were associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the full-heritage Pima Indians (odds ratio 1.30 per copy of the G allele for rs1103125, P = 0.0007, and 1.30 per copy of the glycine allele for rs1800450, P = 0.002, adjusted for age, sex, birth year, and family membership) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These associations replicated in an independent Native American sample (1.19, P = 0.04, for rs11003125) and a Caucasian sample, the Old Order Amish (1.51, P = 0.004, for rs1103125 and 2.38, P = 0.003, for rs1800450) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among Pima Indians with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk allele glycine of Gly54Asp was associated with a decreased <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin response to an intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> bolus infusion (P = 0.004, adjusted for age, sex, percent body fat, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal under physiological insulin stimulation, and family membership) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the functional variants in MBL2 contribute to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility in both Native Americans and the Old Order Amish </plain></SENT>
