<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To explore the potential role of the uncoupling protein (UCP) family in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we have used the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction to quantify UCP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in human skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Levels of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> for UCP2, and for both short (UCP3S) and long (UCP3L) forms of UCP3, were highly correlated in individuals, indicating that gene transcription of these UCPs may be coordinately regulated by common mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-tolerant individuals, muscle UCP2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were positively correlated with percentage of body fat and with BMI (r = 0.6 and P &lt; 0.05 for both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>UCP3S <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were also positively correlated with percentage of body fat (r = 0.52, P &lt; 0.05), and UCP3L <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> tended to increase as a function of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (0.05 &lt; P &lt; 0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>UCP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels, however, were not correlated with resting metabolic rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>UCP3S and UCP3L <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels (P &lt; 0.05) and the UCP2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level (P = 0.09) were increased by 1.8- to 2.7-fold in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, an effect that could not be explained by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was found for UCP2, UCP3S, or UCP3L <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels between insulin-sensitive and insulin-resistant nondiabetic subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that 1) skeletal muscle <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels encoding UCP2 and UCP3 are correlated among individuals and may be coordinately regulated; 2) UCP3 expression is not regulated by differential effects on UCP3L and UCP3S forms of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>; and 3) UCP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression tends to increase in muscle as a function of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> but not of resting metabolic rate or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, and is increased in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
