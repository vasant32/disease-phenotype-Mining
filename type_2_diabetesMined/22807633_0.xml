<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of colesevelam HCl (colesevelam) in type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> patients receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> combination therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This post-hoc subgroup analysis examined data from type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> patients aged 18 to 75 years with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c) of 7.5% to 9.5%, who received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> as part of their treatment via their participation in one of three randomized, double-blind base studies wherein colesevelam (3.75 g/day) or a placebo was added to existing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>-, insulin-, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi>-based treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After completing the base studies, the subjects who initially received blinded colesevelam (n = 196) or the placebo (n = 166) entered a 52-week extension study wherein they received open-label colesevelam (3.75 g/day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: This analysis describes the 362 patients receiving background <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> therapy who also received open-label colesevelam (3.75 g/day) during a 1-year extension study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From a safety perspective, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> was reported by 11 patients (3.0%; none severe) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Drug-related adverse events (AEs) occurred in 38 patients (10.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At least one serious AE occurred in 35 patients (9.7%), with only one being assessed by investigators as drug related (exacerbation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0012813" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diverticulitis</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four patients (6.6%) discontinued open-label treatment because of an AE (10 due to a drug-related AE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with baseline values obtained prior to the start of both the base and extension studies, colesevelam improved and maintained improvement in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c) and various <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This analysis found colesevelam to be generally safe and effective for long-term therapy in type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> patients with inadequately controlled <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> while treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> combination therapy </plain></SENT>
