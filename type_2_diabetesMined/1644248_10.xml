<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Insulin secretion rates were calculated from the peripheral C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> concentration profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ultradian oscillations of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels and insulin secretion rates were evident during fasting in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An additional study with blood sampling at 2-min intervals for 8 h further indicated that this ultradian periodicity is expressed independently of rapid 10-15 min insulin oscillations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no differences between diabetic and non-diabetic subjects in the frequency of the ultradian oscillations of insulin secretion (which averaged 12-15 oscillations per 24 h) and in the rate of concomitancy of oscillations of insulin secretion with oscillations in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, which averaged 63-65% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relative amplitudes of both the insulin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> oscillations were also similar in diabetic and nondiabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The major abnormality in patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was evidenced by spectral analysis, and confirmed by calculations of the distributions of inter-pulse intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It consisted of a slowing of the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> oscillations, without a similar slowing of the oscillations in insulin secretion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
