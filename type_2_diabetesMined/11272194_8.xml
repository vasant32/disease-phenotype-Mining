<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For example, during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878751" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">late pregnancy</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, the increase of the beta-cell mass, in association with beta-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo>, contributes to insulin oversecretion in response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is increasing evidence that the ability of the beta-cell mass to expand in adult mammals is much higher than previously thought </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During pregnancy, placental hormones, especially placental lactogens, are mainly responsible for the changes in beta-cell mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The factors involved in beta-cell growth in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> are far from clear, although increased free fatty acids seem to be the main candidate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Many data suggest that the impairment of insulin secretion in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is partly related to reduction of beta-cell mass, at least relative to prevailing insulin demand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This defect may originate from genetic predisposition, but the situation is likely worsened by environmental factors such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> (glucotoxicity) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> (lipotoxicity) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Better understanding of beta-cell growth and regeneration mechanisms may allow new strategies in the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> based on early limitation of beta-cell damage and/or restoration of a functional beta-cell mass </plain></SENT>
