<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although long acting, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> is frequently given in split doses for type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This may discourage compliance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is thus appropriate to consider dosing it less frequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We therefore studied <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> effects when used once daily and when used in split doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to assess the feasibility of using once daily dosing as a regimen of choice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We measured plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, HbAl and body mass index associated with the regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also compared the number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001988'>hypoglycemic episodes</z:hpo> occurring with them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty type 2 diabetics on multiple daily <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Their regimens were changed over to once daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Blood for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, HbAl and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> and body weight measurements were determined before and after the crossover period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We found no major difference in the sugar and insulin profiles with the two regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Fasting total cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> were also similar and so were plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The HbAl levels and body mass index and number of minor and major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001988'>hypoglycemic episodes</z:hpo> and hospital admissions for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> also did not differ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We conclude that single daily dosing of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> was equivalent to multiple daily dose regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It can be used to an advantage to improve patient's compliance </plain></SENT>
