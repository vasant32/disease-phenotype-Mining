<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Results from two, 12-week, double-blind studies of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> in Japanese patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> receiving once-daily <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> 100 mg were used to construct linear models to develop predictive formulas based on study 1 (S1) and to validate them using study 2 (S2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HbA1c and FPG were the primary and the key secondary end-point for both studies and were both used to develop predictive formulas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The predictive formulas using HbA1c+/-FPG results (slope of change) from week 0 to week 4 in S1 showed high correlations between fitted and observed week 12 HbA1c: for HbA1c alone R2=0.76, for HbA1c+FPG R2=0.89 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When using the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> 100 mg group of S2 data set to assess the validity of the predictive formulas, high correlations for HbA1c alone (R2=0.76) and for HbA1c+FPG (R2=0.77) were also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data using a lower dose (25 mg once daily) of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> also demonstrated similar results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The early responses (over 4 weeks) in HbA1c and FPG with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> can be used to accurately predict later responses (at week 12) in HbA1c in Japanese patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additional studies applying this approach to other agents with diverse mechanisms are important </plain></SENT>
