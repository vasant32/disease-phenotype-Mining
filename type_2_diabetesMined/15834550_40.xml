<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted cost-utility analysis based on patient-level data from a randomised clinical controlled trial involving 4,209 patients with newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> conducted in 23 hospital-based clinics in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland as part of the UK Prospective <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study (UKPDS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three different policies were evaluated: intensive blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control with sulphonylurea/insulin; intensive blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> for overweight patients; and tight blood pressure control of hypertensive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Incremental cost : effectiveness ratios were calculated based on the net cost of healthcare resources associated with these policies and on effectiveness in terms of quality-adjusted life years gained, estimated over a lifetime from within-trial effects using the UKPDS Outcomes Model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life years gained (in year 2004 UK prices) for intensive blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control was 6,028 UK pounds, and for blood pressure control was 369 UK pounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> therapy was cost-saving and increased quality-adjusted life expectancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Each of the three policies evaluated has a lower cost per quality-adjusted life year gained than that of many other accepted uses of healthcare resources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results provide an economic rationale for ensuring that care of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> corresponds at least to the levels of these interventions </plain></SENT>
