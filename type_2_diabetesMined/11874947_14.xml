<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether abnormal endothelial function, a common finding in premenopausal women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, is present in early states of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during pregnancy, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> mellitus (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Brachial artery flow-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> (FMD) (endothelium-dependent) and nitrate-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> (NID) (endothelium-independent) were measured in 23 pregnant subjects with carbohydrate abnormalities (10 IGT, 13 GDM) and in 15 pregnant control subjects during the third trimester of gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>High-resolution vascular ultrasonography was used to perform these investigations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A fasting <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> panel was obtained, and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin values in response to a 100-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> load were also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: FMD was significantly reduced in both groups of women with abnormal carbohydrate metabolism compared with control subjects (7.6 +/- 1.1% in the IGT group and 4.1 +/- 0.9% in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> group vs. 10.9 +/- 1.1% in control subjects, P &lt; 0.04 and P &lt; 0.0001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significant difference in FMD was also observed between IGT and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> groups (P &lt; 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>NID was comparable in the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects, FMD showed a strong independent negative correlation with glycemic area (r=-0.60, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Endothelial dysfunction</z:e>, an early marker of macrovascular disease, is present in pregnancies complicated by IGT and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This alteration, which seems to be directly related to glycemic levels, could explain, at least in part, the increased risk for concurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020538" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HTN">hypertensive disorders</z:e> during pregnancy in these women </plain></SENT>
