<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to describe the health utilities associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and its treatments, complications, and comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 2,048 subjects with type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> recruited from specialty clinics at a university medical center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We administered a questionnaire to each individual to assess demographic characteristics, type and duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, treatments, complications, and comorbidities, and we used the Self-Administered Quality of Well Being index (QWB-SA) to calculate a health utility score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We then created regression models to fit the QWB-SA-derived health utility scores to indicator variables for type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and each demographic variable, treatment, and complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The coefficients were arranged in clinically meaningful ways to develop models to describe penalties from the health utility scores for nonobese diabetic men without additional treatments, complications, or comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The utility scores for nonobese diet-controlled men and women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and no microvascular, neuropathic, or cardiovascular complications were 0.69 and 0.65, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The utility scores for men and women with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and no complications were slightly lower (0.67 and 0.64, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>Blindness</z:hpo>, dialysis, symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e>, foot <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath>, debilitating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> were associated with lower utility scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Major <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> complications are associated with worse health-related quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The health utility scores provided should facilitate studies of the health burden of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the cost-utility of alternative strategies for the prevention and treatment of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
