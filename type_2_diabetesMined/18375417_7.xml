<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this investigation we describe intentional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> strategies used and those related to BMI in a diverse sample of overweight participants with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at enrollment in the Look AHEAD (Action for Health in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp>) clinical trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of baseline <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> strategies, including self-weighing frequency, eating patterns, and weight control practices, reported in 3,063 women and 2,082 men aged 45-74 years with BMI &gt; or =25 kg/m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Less than half (41.4%) of participants self-weighed &gt; or =1/week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Participants ate breakfast 6.0 +/- 1.8 days/week, ate 5.0 +/- 3.1 meals/snacks per day, and ate 1.9 +/- 2.7 fast food meals/week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The three most common weight control practices (increasing fruits and vegetables, cutting out sweets, and eating less high-carbohydrate foods) were reported by approximately 60% of participants for &gt; or =20 weeks over the previous year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adjusted models showed that self-weighing less than once per week (B = 0.83), more fast food meals consumed per week (B = 0.14), and fewer breakfast meals consumed per week (B = -0.19) were associated (P &lt; 0.05) with a higher BMI (R(2) = 0.24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Regular self-weighing and breakfast consumption, along with infrequent consumption of fast food, were related to lower BMI in the Look AHEAD study population </plain></SENT>
