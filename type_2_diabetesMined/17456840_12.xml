<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In 2002-2004, 1,455 participants from the Western New York Health Study, who were free of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and known <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> at baseline (1996-2001), were reexamined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An incident case of pre-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was defined as an individual with fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &lt; 100 mg/dl at the baseline examination and &gt; or = 100 and &lt; or = 125 mg/dl at the follow-up examination, thereby eliminating individuals with prevalent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pre-diabetics</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> case patients (n = 91) were matched 1:3 to control participants based on sex, race/ethnicity, and year of study enrollment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> control subjects had fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels &lt; 100 mg/dl at both baseline and follow-up examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cystatin C concentrations and the urinary albumin-to-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio were measured from frozen (-196 degrees C) baseline blood and urine samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> concentrations were available from the baseline examination only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Multivariate conditional logistic regression analyses adjusted for age, baseline <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level, homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, BMI, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, estimated glomerular filtration rate, cigarette smoking, and alcohol use revealed a significantly increased risk of progression to pre-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among those with elevated baseline concentrations of cystatin C (odds ratio 3.28 [95% CI 1.43-7.54]) (upper quintile versus the remainder) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results of secondary analyses that considered high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, E-selectin, or soluble intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 did not alter these results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that cystatin C was associated with a threefold excess risk of progression to pre-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in this population </plain></SENT>
