<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this randomized clinical trial, 99 T2DM patients (41% male, age 60 ± 6 years) with DPN but without evidence of peripheral artery disease were randomized to receive either BPS (40 µg, tid) or placebo for 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was the improvement of the total symptom score (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TSS</z:e>), temperature rebound (TR) and nadir to peak (NP) above baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 8 weeks treatment, the change of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TSS</z:e> in the BPS group showed a significant improvement compared to the placebo group (2.80 ± 2.48 vs. 1.60 ± 1.94 points, p = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the number of patients who showed signs of improvement in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TSS</z:e> and the proportion of patients with 50% relief of symptom was also significantly greater in the BPS group than in the placebo group (83.7 vs. 62%, p = 0.015, 36.2 vs. 14%, p = 0.009, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, treatment with BPS significantly improved <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TSS</z:e> over an 8-week period </plain></SENT>
