<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Krüppel-like transcription factors are known to play important roles in development and cell differentiation, and have recently been implicated in the pathogenesis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study aimed to examine the associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes encoding members of the Krüppel-like-factor (KLF) family with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a large cohort of Japanese subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We genotyped 33 SNP loci found in 12 KLF genes in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and in subjects from the general population using the PCR-Invader assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also examined the effects of the overexpression of KLF7 on adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified a significant association between an SNP in KLF7 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (A vs C: p=0.004 after Bonferroni's correction, odds ratio=1.59, 95% CI 1.27-2.00) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression of Klf7 decreased in response to the differentiation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and the overexpression of KLF7 resulted in significant inhibition of adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These results indicate that the gene encoding KLF7 is a novel candidate for conferring genetic susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
