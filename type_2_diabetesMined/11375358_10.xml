<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 324 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were randomized, after an 8-week placebo run-in period, to treatment with either placebo, miglitol alone, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> alone, or miglitol plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> for 36 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The miglitol was titrated to 100 mg three times a day and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> was administered at 500 mg three times a day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary efficacy criterion was change in HbA(1c) from baseline to the end of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Secondary parameters included changes in fasting and postprandial plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin levels, serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels, and responder rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 318 patients were valid for intent-to-treat analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A reduction in mean placebo-subtracted HbA(1c) of -1.78% was observed with miglitol plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> combination therapy, which was significantly different from treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> alone (-1.25; P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Miglitol plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> also resulted in better metabolic control than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> alone for fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (-44.8 vs. -20.4 mg/dl; P = 0.0025), 2-h postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> area under the curve (-59.0 vs. -18.0 mg/dl; P = 0.0001), and responder rate (70.6 vs. 45.52%; P = 0.0014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> therapies were well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In type 2 diabetic patients, miglitol in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> gives greater glycemic improvement than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy </plain></SENT>
