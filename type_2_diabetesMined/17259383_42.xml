<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>TCF7L2 acts as both a repressor and transactivator of genes, as directed by the Wnt signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, several highly correlated sequence variants located within a haplotype block of the TCF7L2 gene were observed to associate with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in three Caucasian cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We previously reported linkage of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the San Antonio Family <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study (SAFADS) cohort consisting of extended pedigrees of Mexican Americans to the region of chromosome 10q harboring TCF7L2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We therefore genotyped 11 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from nine haplotype blocks across the gene in 545 SAFADS subjects (178 diabetic) to investigate their role in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We observed nominal association between four SNPs (rs10885390, rs7903146, rs12255372, and rs3814573) in three haplotype blocks and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, age at diagnosis, and 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels (P = 0.001-0.055) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we identified a common protective haplotype defined by these four SNPs that was significantly associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and age at diagnosis (P = 4.2 x 10(-5), relative risk [RR] 0.69; P = 6.7 x 10(-6), respectively) and a haplotype that confers <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk that contains the rare alleles at SNPs rs10885390 and rs12255372 (P = 0.02, RR 1.64) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data provide evidence that variation in the TCF7L2 genomic region may affect risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Mexican Americans, but the attributable risk may be lower than in Caucasian populations </plain></SENT>
