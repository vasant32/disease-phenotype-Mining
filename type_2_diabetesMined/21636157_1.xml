<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey research study in a convenience sample of 211 Chinese Americans with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We measured acculturation and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-management and evaluated the association between acculturation and self-management behaviors after controlling participants' characteristics using structural equation modeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The majority of the participants was born outside the U.S. and had a low level of acculturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Women and older individuals were less acculturated, and those who had higher social economic status and lived in the U.S. for a longer period were more acculturated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results of the structural equation modeling demonstrated that acculturation was significantly associated with DM self-management, and more-acculturated individuals were more likely to perform DM self-management than less-acculturated ones after controlling demographic characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicated that Chinese Americans diagnosed with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may benefit from acculturation to mainstream society probably because increased acculturation was associated with increased help seeking behaviors and increased use of professional services </plain></SENT>
