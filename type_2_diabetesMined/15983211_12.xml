<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To isolate ligands that can home to beta-cells in vivo, we have panned a random phage-displayed 20-mer <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> library on freshly isolated rat islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have isolated two 20-mer <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> that bind to islets ex vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One of these <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> preferentially homes to the islets of Langerhans in a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rat with clear differentiation between the <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> and exocrine cells of the pancreas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, this <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> does not target beta-cells in a type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> animal model, suggesting that the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> can discriminate between <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion-functional and -dysfunctional beta-cells </plain></SENT>
