<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To lower plasma FFA levels effectively and long term, we have treated eight <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for 2 months with placebo followed by 2 months of treatment with a combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> (RGZ) (8 mg/day) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5001">fenofibrate</z:chebi> (FFB) (160 mg/day) in a single-blind placebo-controlled study design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Compared with placebo, RGZ/FFB lowered mean 24-h plasma FFA levels 30% (P &lt; 0.03) and mean 24-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels 23% (P &lt; 0.03) and increased insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake (<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> rate of disappearance [G(R)(d)], determined using euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp) 442% (P &lt; 0.01), oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (area under the curve for 3-h oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test) 28% (P &lt; 0.05), and plasma adiponectin levels 218% (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These RGZ/FFB results were compared with results obtained in five patients treated with RGZ alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RGZ/FFB prevented the fluid retention usually associated with RGZ (-1.6 vs. 5.6%, P &lt; 0.05), lowered fasting plasma FFA more effectively than RGZ alone (-22 vs. 5%, P &lt; 0.05), and tended to be more effective than RGZ alone in lowering A1C (-0.9 vs. -0.4%) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels (-38 vs. -5%) and increasing G(Rd) (442 vs. 330%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that RGZ/FFB is a promising new therapy for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> that lowers plasma FFA more than RGZ alone and in contrast to RGZ does not cause water retention and <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
