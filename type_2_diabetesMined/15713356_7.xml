<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To study the impact of this epidemiologic transition, a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevalence study was performed in 1999-2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fasting capillary blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (cBG) and glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA1c) were systematically measured in a random sample of 3600 subjects aged 30-69 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Weight, height, waist and hip circumferences were also measured to assess body mass index and waist-hip ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis was assessed using an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test according to the World Health Organization recommendations in 363 subjects who had a cBG value &gt; or =6.1 mmol/l, and/or a HbA1c value &gt; or =6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevalence rate was 17.7% for men and 17.3% for women, and the standardized <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevalence rate was 20.1% (95% confidence interval: 18.7-21.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most important morphological factor linked to Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> was waist-hip ratio, a marker of central <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e>, especially in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study confirms that Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is increasing dramatically in societies in epidemiologic transition and is strongly linked to nutritional status </plain></SENT>
