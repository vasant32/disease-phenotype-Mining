<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and stable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> (n = 28) and lean, healthy control subjects (n = 31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forearm blood flow was measured by venous occlusion plethysmography during dose-response studies of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi> (SNP) infused into the brachial artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the patients and 10 healthy control subjects, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> was repeated after intrabrachial infusion of insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were restudied after 2 months of insulin therapy with four daily subcutaneous injections (treatment group, n = 19) or without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic drug</z:chebi> therapy (time control group, n = 9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Insulin infusion raised venous serum insulin in the forearm to high physiological levels (133 +/- 14.6 mU/l in patients) with a minor increase in systemic venous serum insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This increased the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> response by 149 +/- 47, 110 +/- 33, 100 +/- 45, and 106 +/- 44% during the four <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> doses in healthy control subjects (P &lt; 0.0001) but had no effect in patients (P = 0.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 2 months, HbA(1c) in the treatment group had decreased from 10.0 +/- 0.4 to 7.5 +/- 0.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although neither the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> response (P = 0.09) nor the SNP response (P = 0.4) had changed significantly, insulin stimulation had a significant effect, as the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> response increased by 58 +/- 25, 84 +/- 66, 120 +/- 93, and 69 +/- 36% (P = 0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the time control group, insulin stimulation remained without effect after 8 weeks (P = 0.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, insulin therapy partly restores insulin-stimulated endothelial function in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
