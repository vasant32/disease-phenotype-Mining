<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to compare the prevalence and incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> in age- and sex-matched patients with and without type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using an observational cohort design, we selected 10,213 members of an HMO <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> registry as of 1 January 1999 plus 7,159 patients who entered the registry by 31 December 2004 and matched them to patients without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on year of birth and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were followed until they died, left the health plan, or until 31 December 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We compared the baseline prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and then followed patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> to compare <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> incidence while controlling for known risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> prevalence was significantly greater among patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (3.6 vs. 2.5%, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Over a mean follow-up of 7.2 +/- 2.8 years, diabetic patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> at baseline developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> at an age- and sex-adjusted rate of 9.1 per 1,000 person-years (95% CI 8.6-9.7) compared with a rate of 6.6 (6.2-7.1) among nondiabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After full adjustment for other risk factors, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was associated with a 26% increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> among women (hazard ratio 1.26 [95% CI 1.08-1.46]), but <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was not a statistically significant factor among men (1.09 [0.96-1.24]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this population, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was an independent determinant of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> prevalence but predicted incidence only among women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings have potential public health implications and emphasize the need for further investigation of the mechanistic links between <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
