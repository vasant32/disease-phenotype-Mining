<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They were fed a 300kcal lunch consisting of viscous fiber-containing nutrition bars (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>) or commercial nutrition control bars designed for people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (CH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> resulted in a 27.1% increase in fullness (p&lt;0.05), a 15.8% decrease in prospective consumption (p&lt;0.001), and a 14.2% decrease in hunger (p&lt;0.001) in the 120-240min post-lunch areas under the curve (AUC) compared to CH, but no differences were observed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> or thirst (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Similar results were noted for 0-300min AUC values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> were associated with greater frequencies and intensities of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003270'>abdominal distention</z:hpo> (p&lt;0.001) and flatulence (p&lt;0.001), and greater frequency of stools (p&lt;0.001) compared to CH, but there were no differences in mean or maximum (loosest) stool consistency (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, these results suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> could be a useful tool in weight management of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
