<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Glucosensing neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMN) were studied using visually guided slice-patch recording techniques in brain slices from 14- to 21-day-old male Sprague-Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whole-cell current-clamp recordings were made as extracellular <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were increased (from 2.5 to 5 or 10 mmol/l) or decreased (from 2.5 to 0.1 mmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using these physiological conditions to define glucosensing neurons, two subtypes of VMN glucosensing neurons were directly responsive to alterations in extracellular <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Another three subtypes were not directly <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-sensing themselves, but rather were presynaptically modulated by changes in extracellular <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the VMN neurons, 14% were directly inhibited by decreases in extracellular <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-excited [GE]), and 3% were directly excited by decreases in extracellular <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-inhibited [GI]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An additional 14% were presynaptically excited by decreased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (PED neurons) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The other two subtypes of glucosensing neurons were either presynaptically inhibited (PIR; 11%) or excited (PER; 8%) when extracellular <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was raised to &gt; 2.5 mmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>GE neurons sensed decreased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> via an ATP-sensitive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> (K(ATP)) channel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The inhibitory effect of increased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> on PIR neurons appears to be mediated by a presynaptic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16865">gamma-aminobutyric acid</z:chebi>-ergic glucosensing neuron that probably originates outside the VMN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of glucosensing neurons were both fewer in number and showed abnormal responses to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519106" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">rodent model</z:e> of diet-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
