<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighty-four participants were randomized to three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Consecutive 8 week periods of supervised <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, supervised weight maintenance and unsupervised adherence to the prescribed diet using culturally sensitive methods were employed in intervention groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dietary compliance, body composition, blood pressure and metabolic variables were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Body weight was reduced throughout on HP -2.6 (95% confidence interval: -4.4, -0.8)kg and HCHF (-1.6 (-3.0, -0.3)kg) compared with CONT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Total body fat (-1.6 (-3.0, -0.3)kg) and waist circumference (-3.0 (-5.7, -0.2)cm) showed sustained decreases on HP compared with CONT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Diet records suggested reasonable compliance with dietary advice on HP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Carbohydrate intake, but not dietary fiber, increased at the expense of fat on HCHF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: While moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> occurred on both HP and HCHF, HP was associated with some further favorable differences compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
