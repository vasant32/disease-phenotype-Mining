<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Understanding the reasons and eliminating the pervasive health disparities in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is a major research, clinical, and health policy goal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined whether health literacy, general numeracy, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related numeracy explain the association between African American race and poor glycemic control (A1C) in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 383) were enrolled in a cross-sectional study at primary care and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> clinics at three medical centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data collected included the following: self-reported race, health literacy, general numeracy, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related numeracy, A1C, and sociodemographic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A series of structural equation models were estimated to explore the interrelations between variables and test for mediation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In model 1, younger age (r = -0.21, P &lt; 0.001), insulin use (r = 0.27, P &lt; 0.001), greater years with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (r = 0.16, P &lt; 0.01), and African American race (r = 0.12, P &lt; 0.01) were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> associated with poorer glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In model 2, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related numeracy emerged as a strong predictor of A1C (r = -0.46, P &lt; 0.001), reducing the association between African American and poor glycemic control to nonsignificance (r = 0.10, NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In model 3, African American race and older age were associated with lower <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related numeracy; younger age, insulin use, more years with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and lower <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related numeracy were associated with poor glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp>-related numeracy reduced the explanatory power of African American race, such that low <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related numeracy, not African American race, was significantly related to poor glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interventions that address numeracy could help to reduce racial disparities in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
