<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mechanisms responsible for smoking-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> are unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized smokers would have increased intramuscular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> (IMTG) and diacylglycerol (DAG) concentration and decreased fractional synthesis rate (FSR) compared with nonsmokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Nonsmokers (n = 18, aged 20 +/- 0.5 years, BMI 22 +/- 0.4 kg/m(2), body fat 20 +/- 2%, 0 cigarettes per day) and smokers (n = 14, aged 21 +/- 0.7 years, BMI 23 +/- 0.4 kg/m(2), body fat 20 +/- 3%, 18 +/- 0.7 cigarettes per day) were studied in a fasted condition after a standardized diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>[U-(13)C]<z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> was infused during 4 h of rest followed by a skeletal muscle biopsy and intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Smokers were less insulin sensitive (S(i)) compared with nonsmokers (S(i) 5.28 +/- 0.5 nonsmokers vs. 3.74 +/- 0.3 smokers 10(-4) x microU(-1) x ml(-1), P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in IMTG or DAG concentration (IMTG 24.2 +/- 3.4 nonsmokers vs. 27.2 +/- 5.9 smokers microg/mg dry wt, DAG 0.34 +/- 0.02 nonsmokers vs. 0.35 +/- 0.02 smokers microg/mg dry wt) or IMTG FSR between groups (0.66 +/- 0.1 nonsmokers vs. 0.55 +/- 0.09 smokers %/hr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intramuscular <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> composition was different, with increased percent saturation of IMTG (32.1 +/- 1.2 nonsmokers vs. 35.2 +/- 1.0 smokers %, P = 0.05) and DAG (52.8 +/- 1.7 nonsmokers vs. 58.8 +/- 2.2 smokers %, P = 0.04) in smokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Smokers had significantly decreased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (1.76 +/- 0.1 nonsmokers vs. 1.42 +/- 0.11 smokers arbitrary units [AU], P = 0.03) and increased monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (3.11 +/- 0.41 nonsmokers vs. 4.83 +/- 0.54 smokers AU, P = 0.02) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression compared with nonsmokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We also found increased insulin receptor substrate-1 Ser(636) phosphorylation in smokers compared with nonsmokers (0.73 +/- 0.08 nonsmokers vs. 1.14 +/- 0.09 smokers AU, P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest: 1) IMTG concentration and turnover are not related to alterations in insulin action in smokers compared to nonsmokers, 2) increased saturation of IMTG and DAG in skeletal muscle may be related to insulin action, and 3) basal inhibition of insulin receptor substrate-1 may decrease insulin action in smokers </plain></SENT>
