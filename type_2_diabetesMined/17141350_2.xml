<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A prospective observational study was implemented in a university hospital, 286 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> admitted with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Leukocyte count, CRP, admission plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, APACHE II and SOFA score were noted at admission, HbA1c was measured on the first day following admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hospital mortality and hospital length of stay (LOS) were the outcome measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Admission HbA1c was significantly lower in surviving patients than in non-survivors (median 8.2% versus 9.75%, respectively; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a significant correlation between admission HbA1c and hospital LOS of surviving patients (r=0.29; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression showed that HbA1c is an independent predictor of hospital mortality (odds ratio 1.36), together with female sex (OR 2.24), APACHE II score (OR 1.08) and SOFA score (OR 1.28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multiple regression showed that HbA1c and APACHE II score are independently related to hospital LOS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>According to our results, HbA1c is an independent predictive factor for hospital mortality and hospital LOS of diabetic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
