<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated whether a single MTNR1B polymorphism was associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Han Chinese individuals, to elucidate whether this is a cross-populational effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The MTNR1B variant rs10830963 was genotyped in 1,165 type 2 diabetic patients and 1,105 normoglycaemic control individuals of southern Han Chinese ancestry who were residents of the metropolitan area of Shanghai </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was calculated using a logistic regression model adjusted for age, sex and BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A possible association with fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was analysed in the normoglycaemic control individuals using a multiple linear regression analysis with adjustments for age, sex and BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The genetic variant rs10830963 was associated with an increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in our Han Chinese cohort (OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.03-1.31, p = 0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As previously described, the risk variant was also associated with increased fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, showing an increase of 0.068 mmol/l (95% CI 0.036-0.100, p = 4 x 10(-5)) per risk allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: A common variant in the MTNR1B gene is associated with an increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and increased fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in Han Chinese, suggesting an important role for this polymorphism in populations of different ethnic and environmental backgrounds </plain></SENT>
