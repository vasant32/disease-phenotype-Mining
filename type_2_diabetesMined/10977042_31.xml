<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A comprehensive search of Medline, Embase, Lilacs, the Cochrane Clinical Trials Registry bibliographies of relevant papers, and expert input updated through September 1998 was undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> randomized placebo-controlled trials were included in which fish oil supplementation was the only intervention in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three investigators performed data extraction and quality scoring independently with discrepancies resolved by consensus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eighteen trials including 823 subjects followed for a mean of 12 weeks were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Doses of fish oil used ranged from 3 to 18 g/day The outcomes studied were glycemic control and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Meta-analysis of pooled data demonstrated a statistically significant effect of fish oil on lowering <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (-0.56 mmol/l [95% CI -0.71 to -0.41]) and raising <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (0.21 mmol/l [0.02 to 0.41]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant effect was observed for fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HbA1c total cholesterol, or <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>-lowering effect and the elevation in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> were most marked in those trials that recruited hypertriglyceridemic subjects and used higher doses of fish oil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>Heterogeneity</z:hpo> was observed and explained by the recruitment of subjects with baseline <z:hpo ids='HP_0002155'>hypertriglyceridemia</z:hpo> in some studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Fish oil supplementation in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> lowers <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, raises <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, and has no statistically significant effect on glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Trials with hard clinical end points are needed </plain></SENT>
