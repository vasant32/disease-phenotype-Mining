<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A standard "forward-backward" procedure was used to translate MMAS into Malay language </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was later validated on a convenience sample of 223 type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> outpatients between May and September 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reliability was tested for internal consistency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Validity was confirmed using convergent and known group validity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Employing the recommended scoring method, the mean±SD of MMAS scores was 6.13±1.72 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moderate internal consistency was found (Cronbach's α=0.675), the test-retest reliability value was 0.816 (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A positive correlation between the eight- and four-item MMAS was found (r=0.792; p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A significant relationship between MMAS categories and HbA1c categories (χ(2)=20.261; p≥0.001) was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The MMAS sensitivity and specificity, with positive and negative predictive values were 77.61%, 45.37%, 46.84% and 76.56%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this validation study indicate that the Malaysian version of the MMAS is a reliable and valid measure of medication adherence which can now be used </plain></SENT>
