<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Impaired lung function and innate immunity have both attracted growing interest as a potentially novel risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to evaluate whether <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35195">surfactant</z:chebi> protein D (SP-D), a lung-derived innate immune protein, was behind these associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Serum SP-D was evaluated in four different cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cross-sectional associations between SP-D and metabolic and inflammatory parameters were evaluated in two cohorts, the cross-sectional relationship with lung function in one cohort, and the longitudinal effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> on fasting and circadian rhythm of serum SP-D and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> concentrations in one prospective cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the cross-sectional studies, serum SP-D concentration was significantly decreased in subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P = 0.005) and was negatively associated with fasting and postload serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SP-D was also associated with A1C, serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, insulin sensitivity, inflammatory parameters, and plasma insulinase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Smoking subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, but not smoking patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, showed significantly higher serum SP-D concentration than nonsmokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum SP-D concentration correlated positively with end-tidal carbon dioxide tension (r = 0.54, P = 0.034) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the longitudinal study, fasting serum SP-D concentration decreased significantly after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the main components of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> and SP-D rhythms became synchronous after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that lung innate immunity, as inferred from circulating SP-D concentrations, is at the cross-roads of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
