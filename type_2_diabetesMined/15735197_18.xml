<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied this combination in the Reykjavik Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The Reykjavik Study, a population-based cohort study during 1967-1997, recruited 19,381 participants aged 33-84 years who were followed until 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests and chest X-rays were obtained from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cases were defined in accordance with World Health Organization criteria for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or AGR (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> or impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>) and European Society of Cardiology guidelines for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> was 0.5% in men and 0.4% in women, while AGR and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> were found in 0.7% of men and 0.6% of women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among participants with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> regulation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> was diagnosed in 3.2% compared with 6.0 and 11.8% among those with AGR and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the age-group 45-65 years increased in both sexes during the period (P for trend = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio was 2.8 (95% CI 2.2-3.6) for the association between type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and 1.7 (1.4-2.1) between AGR and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is a strong association between any form of glucometabolic perturbation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Future studies in this field should focus on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> abnormalities rather than previously diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> only </plain></SENT>
