<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The currently available formulation of this drug is a twice-daily exenatide (exenatide BID) injection that should be administered within 60 minutes of food </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Once-weekly exenatide (exenatide QW) formulation is now being assessed in a clinical trial program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Exenatide QW has been shown to be the only noninsulin monotherapy to achieve glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels of &lt;7% in &gt;75% of treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It has also demonstrated potential cardiovascular benefits by lowering total and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> concentrations, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels, and both systolic and diastolic blood pressure </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Exenatide QW is associated with a lower incidence of gastrointestinal adverse effects compared with exenatide BID, and no patients treated with exenatide QW monotherapy experienced a confirmed hypoglycemic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Exenatide QW results in 24-hour coverage with exenatide concentrations that are known to improve glycemic control and remain well tolerated in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
