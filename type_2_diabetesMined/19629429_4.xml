<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of various MHTs, according to their formulation and route of administration, on new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a cohort of postmenopausal French women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The association between MHT use and new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was investigated by Cox regression analysis in 63,624 postmenopausal women in the prospective French cohort of the Etude Epidemiologique de Femmes de la Mutuelle Générale de l'Education Nationale (E3N) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were identified through self-reporting or drug-reimbursement record linkage, and further validated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 1,220 new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> cases were validated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We observed a lower risk of new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among women who had ever used MHT (HR 0.82 [95% CI 0.72-0.93]), compared with those who had never used MHT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adjustment for BMI during follow-up (rather than according to baseline BMI) did not substantially modify this association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An oral route of <z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">oestrogen</z:chebi> administration was associated with a greater decrease in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk than a cutaneous route (HR 0.68 [95% CI 0.55-0.85] vs 0.87 [95% CI 0.75-1.00], p for homogeneity = 0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We were not able to show significant differences between the progestagens used in combined MHT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Use of MHT appeared to be associated with a lower risk of new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This relationship was not mediated by changes in BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to confirm the stronger effect of oral administration of <z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">oestrogen</z:chebi> compared with cutaneous administration </plain></SENT>
