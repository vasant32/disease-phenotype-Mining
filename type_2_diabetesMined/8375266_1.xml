<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We measured levels of immunoreactive insulin (IRI) and proinsulin using a sensitive and specific immunoradiometric assay (IRMA), in non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> recently diagnosed type 2 diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The proinsulin IRMA showed full cross reaction with intact proinsulin, des 31-32 proinsulin and des 64-65 proinsulin, but no reaction with insulin or C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a group of 41 recently diagnosed non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> Caucasian type 2 diabetic subjects (study group), mean fasting proinsulin levels were greater than that of 40 age and body mass index (BMI) matched controls (study group 17.4 +/- 2.0, controls 10.1 +/- 0.9 pmol-1, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following a standard test meal, 30 and 60 min levels were not significantly different between groups but 90- and 120-min proinsulin levels were elevated in the study group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The maximum proinsulin to IRI ratio was 20% in the fasting state and did not differ between study and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Proinsulin profiles were similar in subjects receiving oral hypoglycaemic agents and those on dietary treatment alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Proinsulin did not correlate with indices of glycaemic control, total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, but a relationship was observed with IRI before and after the meal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that increased secretion of insulin precursors of low biological activity occurs in non <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> recently diagnosed type 2 diabetic subjects under reasonably good glycaemic control; in such individuals the elevated levels of these precursors are approximately in proportion to the increase in IRI and are less than those reported in some previous studies </plain></SENT>
