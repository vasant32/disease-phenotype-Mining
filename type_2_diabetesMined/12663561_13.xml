<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, the purpose of this study was to examine the validity of using either percent of heart rate reserve (HRR) or a rating of perceived exertion (RPE) scale to prescribe exercise intensity in diabetic individuals both with and without DAN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The subjects consisted of 23 individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, ages 45-75 years, with (DAN; n = 13) or without (No DAN; n = 10) clinical signs of DAN, as assessed by heart rate variability using the expiration-to-inspiration ratio of the R-R interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Peak aerobic capacity was determined using a graded protocol on a cycle ergometer, with RPE, heart rate, and VO(2) values recorded at each stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The subjects were similar with the exception of depressed autonomic function in DAN subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Peak respiratory exchange ratio values were significantly higher (P &lt; 0.05) in the DAN group (1.08 +/- 0.02 vs. 1.02 +/- 0.01 in No DAN subjects), although DAN subjects exhibited a significantly lower (P &lt; 0.05) peak exercise heart rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A similarly highly linear relationship between %HRR and percent VO(2) reserve (VO(2)R) existed for both groups (r = 0.98) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A similar slightly weaker relationship (r = 0.94) was found between RPE and %VO(2)R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, in diabetic individuals, %HRR provides an accurate prediction of %VO(2)R and can be used to prescribe and monitor exercise intensity, regardless of the presence of DAN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The RPE scale is also a valid, albeit slightly less accurate, method to monitor exercise intensity in diabetic individuals </plain></SENT>
