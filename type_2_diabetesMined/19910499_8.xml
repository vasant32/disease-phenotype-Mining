<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We recruited 154 adult patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and randomly assigned them to a routine care control group (n = 79) or a registered dietitian-led intervention group (n = 75) who received on-site diabetic self-management education every 3 months over 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over the 1-year period, neither the intervention group (n = 75) nor the control group (n = 79) had significant changes in A1C, whereas the intervention patients with poorly controlled baseline A1C (&gt; or =7%) (n = 56) had significantly greater improvements in A1C and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> than the control subjects (n = 60) (-0.7 vs. -0.2%, P = 0.034; -13.4 vs. 16.9 mg/dl, P = 0.007) during the same period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also found significant net intervention-control group differences in overall energy intake (-229.06 +/- 309.16 vs. 56.10 +/- 309.41 kcal/day) and carbohydrate intake (-31.24 +/- 61.53 vs. 7.15 +/- 54.09 g/day) (P &lt; 0.001) in patients with poorly controlled A1C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariable adjusted modeling revealed an independent association between changes in carbohydrate intake and A1C in the intervention group (n = 56; beta = 0.10, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e> = 0.033, P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: On-site registered dietitian-led management of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> can improve glycemic control in patients with poorly managed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in primary care clinics in Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A reduction in carbohydrate intake may improve glycemic status </plain></SENT>
