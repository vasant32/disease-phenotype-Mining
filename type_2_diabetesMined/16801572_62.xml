<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of painful diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> (PDPN) in a population-based sample and to estimate its severity and impact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive study consisting of two phases: phase 1, a postal survey to patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (an initial screening questionnaire including one question about pain); phase 2, neurological history and examination using the Toronto Clinical Scoring System </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects with PDPN or mixed (PDPN and nonneuropathic) pain completed the Neuropathic Pain Scale and Neuroqol to assess severity and nature of the pain and impact on quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Those without PDPN completed the Neuroqol only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In phase 1, there was a 92.7% response (n = 326), with 208 (63.8%) subjects reporting pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In phase 2, 269 (82.5%) subjects attended and 51 (19.0%) were found to have PDPN: 99 (36.8%) nonneuropathic pain, 20 (7.4%) mixed pain, and 99 (36.8%) no pain (PDPN prevalence 26.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of those with PDPN, 80% stated that their pain was moderate or severe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Those affected had poorer quality of life than those with no pain (difference in mean scores 3.6 [95% CI 2.5-4.6%]) compared with those with nonneuropathic pain (1.7 [0.4-2.9%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both pain and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> score were independently associated with quality of life, and subjects with PDPN had significantly higher <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed a prevalence of PDPN of 26.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Having PDPN has a significant negative effect on quality of life, and increasing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> is associated with an increasing risk of developing PDPN </plain></SENT>
