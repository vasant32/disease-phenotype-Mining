<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We pooled two data sets of OfT2D (n = 69) and control subjects (n = 45) with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasma C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> was measured during a hyperglycemic clamp ( approximately 10 mmol/l) to quantify model-based first-phase secretion and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> sensitivity of second-phase secretion (beta) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IS was quantified during the hyperglycemic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the pooled data, first-phase secretion was linearly and negatively related to fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, but not IS; OfT2D lay on a distinct line shifted to the left of the control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, beta was negatively related to IS, and OfT2D lay on a distinct line shifted more and more to the left of the control subjects, as IS was worse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, in OfT2D lower beta-cell adaptive responses exist between ambient glycemia and first-phase insulin secretion and between IS and second-phase secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Under conditions leading to decreased insulin sensitivity, these disturbed relationships may lead to progression to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in OfT2D </plain></SENT>
