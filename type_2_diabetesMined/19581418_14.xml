<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To establish a method for isolation and culture of subcutaneous microvascular endothelial cells (MVEC) from small human tissue biopsies to compare gene and protein expression of insulin signaling molecules in MVEC from insulin-resistant and healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Stromavascular cells from subcutaneous needle biopsies of type 2 diabetic and control subjects were expanded in culture and the endothelial cells selected with magnetic immune separation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Western blots and RT-PCR were used for protein and gene expression assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At least 99% of the expanded primary MVEC could be characterized as endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of insulin receptors was low, but <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020459" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">insulin increased</z:e> tyrosine phosphorylation of both the insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 and activated protein kinase B (PKB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The IRS-1 protein expression was reduced and the serine phosphorylation of PKB in response to insulin attenuated whereas basal and insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)1/2 was increased in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> MVEC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Endothelin (ET)-1 mRNA levels were significantly higher in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The addition of ET-1 increased the phosphorylation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (MAPK), an effect antagonized by the MEK-1 inhibitor PD98059 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the endothelin ET(A) and ET(B) receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> BQ123 and BQ788 decreased basal MAPK activity in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> MVEC and prevented the ET-1-induced activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We developed a system for isolation and culture of human MVEC from small needle biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our observations support the concept of "selective" <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, involving IRS-1 and the PI3kinase pathway, as an underlying factor for a dysregulated microvascular endothelium in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our data also support a role of ET-1 for the increased MAPK activity seen in nonstimulated type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> MVEC </plain></SENT>
