<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Good Ageing in Lahti Region (GOAL) Lifestyle Implementation Trial was designed for the primary health care setting, with lifestyle and risk reduction objectives derived from the major <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention efficacy trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report on the program's effectiveness as well as findings related to the program's reach, adoption, and implementation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 352 middle-aged participants with elevated type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk were recruited from the health care centers in Päijät-Häme Province in Finland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The intervention included six group counseling sessions, delivered by trained public health nurses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Measurement was conducted at baseline and 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical risk factors were measured by study nurses, and lifestyle outcomes were analyzed from self-reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lifestyle outcomes were compared with the outcomes achieved in relevant efficacy trials, and within-subject changes were tested for risk reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, mean BMI was &gt;32 kg/m2, and 25% of the participants had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 12 months, 20% of participants achieved at least four of five key lifestyle outcomes, with these results being comparable with the reference trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, physical activity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> goals were achieved significantly less frequently (65 vs. 86% and 12 vs. 43%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Several clinical risk factors decreased, more so among men than women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This trial demonstrates that lifestyle counseling can be effective and is feasible in real-world settings for individuals with elevated risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>To increase program impact, program exposure and treatment intensity need to be increased </plain></SENT>
