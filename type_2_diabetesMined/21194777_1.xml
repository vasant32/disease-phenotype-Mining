<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cardiovascular risk profile of screen-detected (SD) T2DM is ill defined and has not been compared to conventional newly diagnosed (CD) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Baseline data from SD (n=337) and CD (n=824) cohorts were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SD adopted mixed approaches to screening, population based (n=214) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular-risk factor</z:e> targeted (n=123) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CD reflected UK primary care practice with cases referred within four weeks of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: People with SD T2DM were leaner, had a lower HbA1c(%) and lower <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> but were more hypertensive compared to people with CD T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fewer SD were on blood pressure lowering (46% vs. 60%, p&lt;0.0001), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> (30% vs. 41%, p&lt;0.0001) or anti-platelet (15% vs. 27%, p&lt;0.0001) therapies </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Individuals with SD T2DM are at high risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> as a result of untreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
