<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is a predisposing factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001733'>pancreatitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002894'>pancreatic cancer</z:hpo>, both of which are more common in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study reported here was to establish if <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and/or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are associated with increased pancreatic ductal replication in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We obtained pancreas at autopsy from 45 humans, divided into four groups: lean (BMI &lt;25 kg/m(2)); <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (BMI &gt;27 kg/m(2)); non-diabetic; and with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pancreases were evaluated after immunostaining for the duct cell marker cytokeratin and Ki67 for replication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We show for the first time that both <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in humans are associated with increased pancreatic ductal replication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Specifically, we report that (1) replication of pancreatic duct cells is increased tenfold by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and (2) lean subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> demonstrate a fourfold increase in replication of pancreatic duct cells compared with their lean non-diabetic controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Pancreatic duct cell replication is increased in humans in response to both <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, potentially providing a mechanism for the increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001733'>pancreatitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002894'>pancreatic cancer</z:hpo> in those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and/or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
