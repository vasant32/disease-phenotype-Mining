<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The role of adiponectin in the natural history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is not well characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We set out to characterize prediagnosis trajectories of adiponectin in individuals who develop type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a case-cohort study (335 incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> case and 2,474 noncase subjects) nested in the Whitehall II study, serum adiponectin was measured up to three times per participant (1991-1993, 1997-1999, and 2003-2004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multilevel models adjusted for age and ethnicity were fitted to assess 13-year trajectories of log-transformed adiponectin preceding <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosis or a randomly selected time point during follow-up (year(0)) based on 755/5,095 (case/noncase) person-examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Adiponectin levels were lower in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> case than in noncase subjects (median 7,141 [interquartile range 5,187-10,304] vs. 8,818 [6,535-12,369] ng/mL at baseline, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Control subjects showed a modest decline in adiponectin throughout follow-up (0.3% per year, P &lt; 0.0001) at higher levels in women than in men (difference at year(0): 5,358 ng/mL, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Female case and early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> case (age at diagnosis &lt;52 years) subjects had a steeper decline than control subjects (slope difference -1.1% per year, P = 0.001 in females, -1.6% per year in early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> case subjects, P = 0.034) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In men, adiponectin slopes for case and noncase subjects were parallel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The slope differences by <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> were largely attenuated after adjustment for changes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, whereas the sex-specific slope differences were independent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Lower adiponectin levels were observed already a decade before the diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The marked sex difference in trajectories suggests that sex-specific mechanisms affect the association between adiponectin levels and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> development </plain></SENT>
