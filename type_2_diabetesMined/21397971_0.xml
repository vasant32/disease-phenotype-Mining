<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A prospective population-based study including 4794 women, aged 36-56 at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>None had previously diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At both baseline and follow-up 8 years later, the women were examined by oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Information regarding lifestyle factors and anthropometric measurements were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, current use of OCs was associated with pre (Odds ratio, OR 4.1, 95%CI 2.2-7.8) but not with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The association to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetes</z:e> was entirely linked to IGT (OR 7.1, 3.3-15.8) in current users of OCs and in former users (OR 2.1, 1.1-3.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Women who used OC at baseline had a better <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> risk profile; lower body mass index (BMI), more physically active and less smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At follow-up, the increased risk did not persist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Current use of OC was associated with a four times increased risk of having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetes</z:e> and seven times of having <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No increased risk persisted at the follow-up, suggesting that the risk due to prior use of OC is decreasing with time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The healthier lifestyle in women who used OCs may have contributed to reduced long-term risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
