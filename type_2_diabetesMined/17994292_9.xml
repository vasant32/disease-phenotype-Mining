<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Only a few human studies have investigated the role of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> in the pathogenesis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to examine whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22470">alpha-tocopherol</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17579">beta-carotene</z:chebi> affected the occurrence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22470">Alpha-Tocopherol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17579">Beta-Carotene</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Prevention (ATBC) Study, a double-blind, controlled trial, 29,133 male smokers aged 50-69 years were randomised to receive either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22470">alpha-tocopherol</z:chebi> (50 mg/day) or <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17579">beta-carotene</z:chebi> (20 mg/day) or both agents or placebo daily for 5-8 years (median 6.1 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Baseline serum samples were analysed for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22470">alpha-tocopherol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17579">beta-carotene</z:chebi> using HPLC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were identified from a nationwide Finnish registry of patients receiving drug reimbursement for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of 27,379 men without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at baseline, 705 men were diagnosed with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during the follow-up of up to 12.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Baseline serum levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22470">alpha-tocopherol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17579">beta-carotene</z:chebi> were not associated with the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the placebo group: the relative risk (RR) between the highest and lowest quintiles of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22470">alpha-tocopherol</z:chebi> was 1.59 (95% CI 0.89-2.84) and that for <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17579">beta-carotene</z:chebi> was 0.66 (95% CI 0.40-1.10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neither supplementation significantly affected the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>: the RR was 0.92 (95% CI 0.79-1.07) for participants receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22470">alpha-tocopherol</z:chebi> compared with non-recipients and 0.99 (95% CI 0.85-1.15) for participants receiving <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17579">beta-carotene</z:chebi> compared with non-recipients </plain></SENT>
