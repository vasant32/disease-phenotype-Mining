<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Few studies have examined the association of CRP, MS and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in women with previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Women with previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> (n=70) and randomly sampled women without previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> (n=108) from the one center of the Brazilian Study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>Gestational Diabetes</z:hpo> participated in the study after 6 years of index pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test and anthropometry were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CRP levels were measured by the nephelometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The MS was defined by the ATPIII criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was significant positive linear correlation between CRP levels, fasting insulin (R=0.053) and HOMA IR (0.048) in previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean CRP levels were significantly higher in previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> group with abdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (1.227 95% CI 0.871-1.584 versus 0.597, 95% CI 0.378-0.817; p=0.001) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001952'>abnormal glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (1.168 95% CI 0.784-1.552 versus 0.657 95% CI 0.455-0.859, p=0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were differences when considering the presence of different MS features, once the previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> group reported a significantly higher number of women with low <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> (74.3% versus 55.6%, p=0.016) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001952'>abnormal glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (45.7% versus 25%, p=0.005) than the group without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On average, the CRP levels were significantly higher in women with previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> and MS (0.918 95% CI 0.569; 1.268 versus 0.524 95% CI 0.373; 0.675, p=0.044) than the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The data suggests that the presence of MS in women with previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> is associated with high levels of CRP </plain></SENT>
