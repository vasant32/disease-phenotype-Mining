<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 468 drug-naive patients with uncontrolled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were recruited for this multicentre, double-blind trial if their glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (A1c) was greater than 7.5%, but less than or equal to 11%, and their fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) was less than or equal to 15 mmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomized to 32 weeks of blinded treatment with either RSG/MET fixed-dose combination (n = 155), MET (n = 154) or RSG (n = 159) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The groups were comparable at baseline, with mean A1c of 8.8% and FPG of 11 mmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RSG/MET was initiated with a total daily dose of 2 mg/500 mg and could be increased up to 8 mg/2000 mg; MET therapy began with a total daily dose of 500 mg and could be increased up to 2000 mg; and RSG treatment began with a total daily dose of 4 mg and could be increased up to 8 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Medication was uptitrated during on-therapy visits based on failure to attain glycaemic target of mean daily <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> less than or equal to 6.1 mmol/l (unless at maximum tolerated dose) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were assessed for efficacy and safety at nine visits over a 32-week treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This was a trial designed to show greater efficacy of RSG/MET combination therapy compared with MET or RSG monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was change in A1c from baseline to week 32 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Secondary end points included the proportion of patients achieving recommended A1c and FPG targets for glycaemic control and change from baseline in FPG, free fatty acid, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, insulin, insulin sensitivity, C-reactive protein and adiponectin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Safety evaluations included adverse-event (AE) monitoring, changes in weight and clinical laboratory evaluations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At week 32, RSG/MET showed significant improvements in A1c from a baseline of 8.9 +/- 1.1% to 6.6 +/- 1.0% at study end, and this 2.3% reduction was significantly greater than the reductions achieved individually with MET (-1.8%; p = 0.0008) and RSG (-1.6%; p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The greatest mean decrease in FPG was seen with RSG/MET (-4.1 mmol/l) and was significant compared with MET (-2.8 mmol/l; p &lt; 0.0001) and RSG (-2.6 mmol/l; p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Target A1c of less than or equal to 6.5% and less than 7% were achieved in more patients in the RSG/MET group (60% and 77%) than with MET (39% and 57%) or RSG (35% and 58%) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Treatment was well tolerated, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> and diarrhoea as the most commonly reported AEs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>Oedema</z:hpo> was comparable between RSG/MET (6%) and RSG (7%) and lower in the MET group (3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>No new safety and tolerability issues were observed in the RSG/MET group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: As first-line therapy in patients with uncontrolled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, RSG/MET fixed-dose combination therapy achieved significant reductions in A1c and FPG compared with either RSG or MET monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>RSG/MET was generally well tolerated as initial therapy, with no new tolerability issues identified with the fixed-dose combination </plain></SENT>
