<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 731 subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DPN was diagnosed on the basis of neuropathic symptoms, insensitivity to a 10-g monofilament, abnormal pin-prick sensation, and abnormal current perception threshold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Arterial stiffness was assessed by cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> was assessed by B-mode ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with DPN had higher CAVI than those without DPN in multivariate-adjusted models, whereas no differences in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> were observed between patients with and without DPN after adjustment for age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate analysis, CAVI was a significant determinant of DPN (odds ratio 1.36 [95% CI 1.13-1.65], P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: DPN is significantly associated with arterial stiffness without carotid intimal changes in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
