<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined prospectively the association between nocturnal intermittent <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> as a surrogate marker of obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnoea</z:hpo> and risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 4,398 community residents aged 40 to 69 years who had participated in sleep investigation studies between 2001 and 2005 were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nocturnal intermittent <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> was assessed by pulse-oximetry and defined by the number of oxygen desaturation measurements &lt; or =3% per h, with five to &lt;15 per h corresponding to mild and 15 events or more per h corresponding to moderate-to-severe nocturnal intermittent <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was defined by: (1) fasting serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &gt; or =7.00 mmol/l (126 mg/dl); (2) non-fasting serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &gt; or =11.1 mmol/l (200 mg/dl); and/or (3) initiation of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering medication or insulin therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariable model accounted for age, sex, BMI, smoking status, current alcohol intake, community, borderline type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, habitual snoring, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002189'>excessive daytime sleepiness</z:hpo>, sleep duration and (for women) menopausal status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: By the end of 2007, 92.2% of participants had been followed up (median follow-up duration [interquartile range] 3.0 [2.9-4.0] years) and 210 persons identified as having developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio (95% CI) for developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 1.26 (0.91-1.76) among those with mild nocturnal intermittent <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> and 1.69 (1.04-2.76) among those with moderate-to-severe nocturnal intermittent <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> (p = 0.03 for trend) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Nocturnal intermittent <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> was associated with increased risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among middle-aged Japanese </plain></SENT>
