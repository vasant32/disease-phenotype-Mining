<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data were from a cross-sectional study with 1,453 racially/ethnically diverse eighth grade students from 12 middle schools in three U.S. states (Texas, North Carolina, and California) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Height, weight, waist circumference, and blood pressure were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fasting blood samples were analyzed for <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and insulin; HOMA-IR was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sex, race/ethnicity, and pubertal stage were self-reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IDF criteria were used to determine the prevalence of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio for being classified with the syndrome was calculated by quintiles of fasting insulin and HOMA-IR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the sample, 138 students (9.5%) were classified with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hispanics were more likely to have high abdominal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> and high <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Male adolescents were more likely to have high <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003233'>low HDL cholesterol</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002842'>high blood pressure</z:mp>, and high fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Participants in the highest insulin quintile were almost 200 times more likely to be classified with the syndrome than participants in the lowest quintile with comparable associations for HOMA-IR quintiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In a racially/ethnically diverse sample of U.S. adolescents, 9.5% of participants were identified with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> using the IDF criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The likelihood of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> classification significantly increased with higher insulin and HOMA-IR values </plain></SENT>
