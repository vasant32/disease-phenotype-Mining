<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the ACE gene has been described to be associated with DN risk and progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The renal lesions underlying DN in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo>; only a subset of patients, characterized by a faster decline of renal function, have diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100820'>glomerulopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study explored the relations between diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100820'>glomerulopathy</z:hpo> and the ACE genotype distribution in 77 type 2 diabetic patients with an albumin excretion rate &gt; or = 20 microg/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using morphometric analysis of kidney biopsies, mesangial and mesangial matrix fractional volumes [Vv(mes/glom) and Vv(MM/glom)] and glomerular basement membrane (GBM) width were estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that 13 patients were II, 30 were ID, and 34 were DD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical features and renal function were similar in the three groups; in contrast, the DD patients had the highest Vv(MM/glom) and GBM width </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subdividing patients in tertiles of GBM width and Vv(MM/glom), from the lowest (I) to the highest (III) values, the DD carriers had an odds ratio of 6.11 (95% CI 1.84-20.3) and 10.67 (2.51-45.36), respectively, for the likelihood of being in tertile III than I for GBM width and Vv(MM/glom) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multiple regression analysis revealed the I/D polymorphism as an independent determinant of <z:mp ids='MP_0011409'>GBM thickening</z:mp> in addition to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration and HbA(1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the ACE DD genotype is associated with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100820'>glomerulopathy</z:hpo> lesions, making the study of this polymorphism helpful in identifying those type 2 diabetic patients at higher risk of fast DN progression </plain></SENT>
