<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16749">Phosphoinositide</z:chebi> 3-kinase (PI3K) is a major effector in insulin signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>rs361072, located in the promoter of the gene (PIK3CB) for the p110beta subunit, has previously been found to be associated with homeostasis model assessment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-IR) in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim was to investigate the influence of rs361072 on in vivo <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism, skeletal muscle PI3K subunit protein levels, and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The functional role of rs361072 was studied in 196 Danish healthy adult twins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Peripheral and hepatic insulin sensitivity was assessed by a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Basal and insulin-stimulated biopsies were taken from the vastus lateralis muscle, and tissue p110beta and p85alpha proteins were measured by Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The genetic association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and quantitative metabolic traits was investigated in 9,316 Danes with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance ranging from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> to overt type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: While hepatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> was similar in the fasting state, carriers of the minor G allele had lower hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> output (per-allele effect: -16%, P(add) = 0.004) during high physiological insulin infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>rs361072 did not associate with insulin-stimulated peripheral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal despite a decreased muscle p85alpha:p110beta protein ratio (P(add) = 0.03) in G allele carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No association with HOMA-IR or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (odds ratio 1.07, P = 0.5) was identified, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> did not interact with rs361072 on these traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the minor G allele of PIK3CB rs361072 associates with decreased muscle p85alpha:p110beta ratio and lower hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production at high plasma insulin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, no impact on type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevalence was found </plain></SENT>
