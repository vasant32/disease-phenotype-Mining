<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The presence and biological significance of circulating glycated insulin has been evaluated by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), radioimmunoassay (RIA), receptor binding, and hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ESI-MS analysis of an HPLC-purified plasma pool from four male type 2 diabetic subjects (HbA(1c) 8.1 +/- 0.2%, plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> 8.7 +/- 1.3 mmol/l [means +/- SE]) revealed two major insulin-like peaks with retention times of 14-16 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After spectral averaging, the peak with retention time of 14.32 min exhibited a prominent triply charged (M+3H)(3+) species at 1,991.1 m/z, representing monoglycated insulin with an intact M(r) of 5,970.3 Da </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The second peak (retention time 15.70 min) corresponded to native insulin (M(r) 5,807.6 Da), with the difference between the two <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> (162.7 Da) representing a single <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30911">glucitol</z:chebi> adduct (theoretical 164 Da) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Measurement of glycated insulin in plasma of type 2 diabetic subjects by specific RIA gave circulating levels of 10.1 +/- 2.3 pmol/l, corresponding to approximately 9% total insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Biological activity of pure synthetic monoglycated insulin (insulin B-chain Phe(1)-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30911">glucitol</z:chebi> adduct) was evaluated in seven overnight-fasted healthy nonobese male volunteers using two-step euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamps (2 h at 16.6 micro g x kg(-1) x min(-1), followed by 2 h at 83.0 micro g x kg(-1) x min(-1); corresponding to 0.4 and 2.0 mU x kg(-1) x min(-1)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the lower dose, the exogenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion rates required to maintain euglycemia during steady state were significantly lower with glycated insulin (P &lt; 0.01) and approximately 70% more glycated insulin was required to induce a similar rate of insulin-mediated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Maximal responses at the higher rates of infusion were similar for glycated and control insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Inhibitory effects on endogenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production, insulin secretion, and lipolysis, as indicated by measurements of C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, nonesterified free fatty acids, and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi>, were also similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Receptor binding to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi>-T cells transfected with human insulin receptor and in vivo metabolic clearance revealed no differences between glycated and native insulin, suggesting that impaired biological activity is due to a postreceptor effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The present demonstration of glycated insulin in human plasma and related impairment of physiological insulin-mediated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake suggests a role for glycated insulin in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> toxicity and impaired insulin action in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
