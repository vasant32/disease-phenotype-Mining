<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine whether any of these activities were physiologically relevant in an intact animal, A(1)AR was overexpressed in adipose tissue of transgenic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lower plasma free fatty acid (FFA) levels were observed in the transgenic mice relative to the litter-matched controls, supporting a significant physiological role for adipocyte A(1)AR in the control of lipolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, no differences were observed in body weights or body composition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On a high fat diet, both the transgenic mice and the litter matched controls, male and female, became equally <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unlike the control mice, however, the transgenic mice did not develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, as demonstrated by serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin levels and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin tolerance tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate that adipocyte A(1)AR plays an important physiological role in the control of insulin sensitivity in an intact animal and therefore should be considered to be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
