<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To quantitate the different components of fatty acid metabolism, an isotope infusion of [U-13C]-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> was used in combination with indirect calorimetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In separate experiments, the <z:chebi fb="18" ids="36928">13C</z:chebi> label recovery in expired air was determined during infusion of [1,2-13C]-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> recovery factor) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in energy expenditure or carbohydrate and total fat oxidation between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rate of appearance (Ra) of free fatty acid (FFA) (P &lt; 0.05) and the exercise-induced increase in Ra of FFA were significantly lower (P &lt; 0.05) in type 2 diabetic subjects compared with control subjects (baseline vs. exercise [40-60 min]; type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> 11.9 +/- 0.9 vs. 19.6 +/- 2.2 micromol x kg(-1) fat-free mass [FFM] x min(-1) and control 15.8 +/- 1.8 vs. 28.6 +/- 2.1 micromol x kg(-1) FFM x min(-1)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The oxidation of plasma-derived fatty acids was significantly lower in type 2 diabetic subjects during both conditions (P &lt; 0.05, baseline vs. exercise [40-60 min]; type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> 4.2 +/- 0.5 vs. 14.1 +/- 1.9 micromol x kg(-1) FFM x min(-1) and control 6.2 +/- 0.6 vs. 20.4 +/- 1.9 micromol x kg(-1) FFM x min(-1)), whereas the oxidation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>-derived fatty acids was higher (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is hypothesized that these impairments in fatty acid utilization may play a role in the etiology of skeletal muscle and hepatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
