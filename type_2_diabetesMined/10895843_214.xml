<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to determine whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> is associated with poor glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Medline and PsycINFO databases and published reference lists were used to identify studies that measured the association of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> with glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Meta-analytic procedures were used to convert the findings to a common metric, calculate effect sizes (ESs), and statistically analyze the collective data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 24 studies satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> was significantly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> (Z = 5.4, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The standardized ES was in the small-to-moderate range (0.17) and was consistent, as the 95% CI was narrow (0.13-0.21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ES was similar in studies of either type 1 or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (ES 0.19 vs. 0.16) and larger when standardized interviews and diagnostic criteria rather than self-report questionnaires were used to assess <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (ES 0.28 vs. 0.15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> in patients with type 1 or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additional studies are needed to establish the directional nature of this relationship and to determine the effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> treatment on glycemic control and the long-term course of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
