<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The extensive clinical experience gained with insulin glargine, in particular, the low risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> and consistent improvements in HbA(1c), suggests that insulin glargine can be initiated aggressively to help patients reach such HbA(1c) targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, many clinicians may be unaware of how easy it is to initiate insulin glargine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the once-daily injection of insulin glargine plus once-daily measurement of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> should provide little difficulty for patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the current review, the options for the initiation of insulin glargine in T2DM and how the patient can become more involved in management of their <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The advantages of insulin glargine in randomized controlled trials and how these have translated into everyday clinical practice are also discussed </plain></SENT>
