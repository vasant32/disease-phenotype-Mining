<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of incremental doses of repaglinide on postprandial insulin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> profiles after a standard 500-kcal test meal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Sixteen diet-treated Caucasians with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (mean HbA(1c) 8.4%) were enrolled in this randomized, open-label, crossover trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects received 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 mg repaglinide or placebo in a random fashion, followed by a standard 500-kcal test meal on 5 separate study days, 1 week apart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The insulinogenic index (DeltaI30/DeltaG30) and insulin area under the curve (AUC) from 0 to 30 min (AUC(0-30)) were higher with the 4-mg drug dose compared with the two lower doses and with 2 mg compared with 0.5 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On subgroup analysis, the incremental insulin responses were apparent only in the fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) &lt; 9-mmol/l subgroup of subjects and not in the FPG &gt;9-mmol/l subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a significant dose-related increase in the late postprandial insulin secretion (insulin AUC(120-240)), which resulted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> in four subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Proinsulin-to-insulin ratios at 30 and 60 min improved with increasing doses of repaglinide; higher drug doses (2 and 4 mg) were more effective than the 0.5- and 1-mg doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Significant dose-related increases in early insulin secretion were found only in less advanced diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In advanced diabetic patients, only the maximum dose (4 mg) was significant compared with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Better proinsulin-to-insulin processing was noted with increasing drug doses </plain></SENT>
