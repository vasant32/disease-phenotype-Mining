<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among the many known actions of TZDs, increased circulating levels of the high molecular weight (HMW) multimer of adiponectin may be an important insulin-sensitizing mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the effects of only 21 days of 45 mg of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (P+) versus placebo (P-) in nine subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (HbA(1c), 10.9 +/- 0.6%; BMI, 31.9 +/- 1.5 kg/m(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Total adiponectin levels increased by approximately twofold in P+ in association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009126'>increased adipose tissue</z:hpo> gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, plasma free fatty acid and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were unchanged, and there were only minimal changes in other "adipokines." <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> fluxes ([3-(3)H]<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion) were measured during 6-h euglycemic (5 mmol/l) "pancreatic clamp" studies (somatostatin/glucagon/growth hormone) with stepped insulin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">Pioglitazone</z:chebi> induced marked decreases in endogenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production (P+ = 0.9 +/- 0.1 vs. P- = 1.7 +/- 0.3 mg </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Maximal insulin stimulation ( approximately 400 microU/ml) revealed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>-associated increases in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake (P+ = 10.5 +/- 0.9 vs. P- = 8.9 +/- 0.8 mg </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, only 21 days of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> therapy improved insulin action in humans with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Increased abundance of the HMW adiponectin multimer may contribute to the hepatic insulin-sensitizing effects of these agents </plain></SENT>
