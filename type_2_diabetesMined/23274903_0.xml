<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we studied the direct contribution of the suprachiasmatic nucleus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29425">(SCN)</z:chebi>, the central pacemaker in the circadian system, in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Exclusive bilateral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18022">SCN</z:chebi> lesions in male C57Bl/6J mice, as verified by immunochemistry, showed a small but significant increase in body weight (+17%), which was accounted for by an increase in fat mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, mice with collateral damage to the ventromedial hypothalamus and paraventricular nucleus showed severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mice with exclusive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18022">SCN</z:chebi> ablation revealed a loss of circadian rhythm in activity, oxygen consumption, and food intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp analysis 8 weeks after lesioning showed that the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion rate was significantly lower in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18022">SCN</z:chebi> lesioned mice compared with sham-operated mice (-63%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although insulin potently inhibited endogenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production (-84%), this was greatly reduced in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18022">SCN</z:chebi> lesioned mice (-7%), indicating severe hepatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data show that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18022">SCN</z:chebi> malfunctioning plays an important role in the disturbance of energy balance and suggest that an absence of central clock activity, in a genetically intact animal, may lead to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
