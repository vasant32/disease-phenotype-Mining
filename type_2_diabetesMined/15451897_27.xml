<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, median age 61.5 years (range 53.1-72.0), known duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> 5.9 years (range 2.8-11.2), BMI 29.8 kg/m2 (range 22.0-34.6), and HbA1c 7.5% (range 6.7-8.4) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment modalities varied from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> medications to insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A hyperinsulinemic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> clamp was used to maintain arterialized blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> at either 4.5 (euglycemia) or 16.5 mmol/l (<z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>) on two occasions in a randomized and counterbalanced fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tests of information processing, immediate and delayed memory, working memory, and attention were administered, along with a mood questionnaire, during each experimental condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Speed of information processing, working memory, and some aspects of attention were impaired during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subjects were significantly more dysphoric during <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, with reduced energetic arousal and increased sadness and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: During <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, cognitive function was impaired and mood state deteriorated in a group of people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings are of practical importance because intermittent or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> is common in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and may interfere with many daily activities through adverse effects on cognitive function and mood </plain></SENT>
