<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We measured subsets of T and natural killer cells with monoclonal antibodies in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and also assayed for anti-lymphocyte antibodies using dual colour immunofluorescence and flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found a significant decrease in numbers of Leu 3a (helper/inducer) cells in Type 1 diabetic patients of recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and intermediate levels in patients with longer duration of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Leu 4 (pan T cell) levels were reduced in Type 1 diabetic patients of more than 4 months duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Leu 7 (natural killer cells) were increased in Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Individual Type 1 diabetic patients of recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> showed low levels of Leu 7 and 11 a (natural killer cell) levels with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> 3a levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Autoantibodies against Leu 3a + cells were present in higher titres in the Type 1 diabetic patients of recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> than in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude: (1) Leu 3a cells may be decreased in Type 1 diabetic patients of recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and return to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> with time; (2) low numbers of Leu 7 and 11a cells with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> numbers of Leu 3a may be seen in some Type 1 diabetic patients of recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, which may help explain previous reports of decreased suppressor cells; (3) Leu 7 levels may be increased in Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; (4) autoantibodies against Leu 3a + peripheral lymphocytes may be seen in Type 1 diabetic patients of recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These appear to be a marker of autoimmune phenomena rather than immunological mediators </plain></SENT>
