<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The International Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> 1q Consortium showed that one of the nominal associations was located in the NOS1AP gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although this association was not replicated in additional samples of European descent, it remains unknown whether NOS1AP plays a role in Chinese individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In stage 1 analyses, 79 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the NOS1AP gene were successfully genotyped in a group of Shanghai Chinese individuals, comprising 1,691 type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients and 1,720 control participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In stage 2 analyses, the SNP showing the strongest association was genotyped in additional Chinese individuals, including 1,663 type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients and 1,408 control participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In stage 1 analyses, 20 SNPs were nominally associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (p &lt; 0.05), with SNP rs12742393 showing the strongest association (OR 1.24 [95% CI 1.11-1.38]; p = 0.0002, empirical p = 0.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Haplotype analysis also confirmed the association between rs12742393 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In stage 2 analyses, the difference in allele frequency distribution of rs12742393 did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.254) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the meta-analysis showed a significant association between rs12742393 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with an OR of 1.17 (95% CI 1.07-1.26; p = 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our data suggest that NOS1AP variants may not play a dominant role in susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but a minor effect cannot be excluded </plain></SENT>
