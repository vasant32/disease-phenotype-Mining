<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, blood pressure was evaluated by trough office blood pressure (OBP), which may underestimate reductions in 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we evaluated 24-h blood pressure patterns in a subpopulation of the IRMA2 trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Type 2 diabetic patients (n = 43) with persistent <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> (as determined by repeated overnight measurements of urinary albumin excretion [UAE]) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> who were included in the IRMA2 study at the Steno <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Center were subjected to 24-h ABP (Takeda, TM2420) measurements before and 2 years after randomization to placebo (n = 15), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5959">irbesartan</z:chebi> 150 mg daily (Irb150; n = 13), or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5959">irbesartan</z:chebi> 300 mg daily (Irb300; n = 15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, the placebo, Irb150, and Irb300 groups were comparable: OBP: 157 +/- 15/89 +/- 7, 156 +/-15/91 +/- 11, and 159 +/- 16/90 +/- 9 mmHg (NS); 24-h ABP: 148 +/- 13/83 +/- 11, 148 +/- 16/82 +/- 7 and 147 +/- 16/81 +/- 10 mmHg (NS); and UAE (geometric mean with 95% CI): 43 (32-57), 46 (30-70), and 59 (42-85) micro g/min (NS), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that 2 years after randomization, OBP was significantly reduced in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three groups (by 11/7, 13/8, and 13/8 mmHg in the placebo, Irb150, and Irb300 groups, respectively), but that there were no significant differences among groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reductions in 24-h ABP were similar in the three groups (11/10, 5/7, and 7/8 mmHg, respectively; NS), as were reductions in day ABP (11/9, 7/7, and 8/9 mmHg, respectively; NS) and night ABP (4/11, 7/7, and 3/3 mmHg, respectively; NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The reduction in UAE at the end of the study was 0% (-86 to 42), 38% (-14 to 66), and 73% (59 to 82), respectively (overall, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5959">Irbesartan</z:chebi> is renoprotective independently of its beneficial effect in lowering 24-h blood pressure in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and persistent <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
