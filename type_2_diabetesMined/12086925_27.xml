<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although these arrays were not specifically geared to represent tissues and pathways known to be affected by <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, they have been used in both type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To prepare a tool that is particularly useful in the study of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we have assembled a nonredundant set of 3,400 clones representing genes expressed in the mouse pancreas or pathways known to be affected by <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have demonstrated the usefulness of this clone set by preparing a cDNA glass microarray, the PancChip, and using it to analyze pancreatic gene expression from embryonic day 14.5 through adulthood in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The clone set and corresponding array are useful resources for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> research </plain></SENT>
