<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genetic polymorphism of apo E has been reported as an important <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> genetic marker associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> is a disease with a high incidence and prevalence in the world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The main cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in these patients is myocardial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and a high incidence of general cardiovascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this work was to characterize the genotype of apo E in diabetic patients from Talca, Chile, in order to describe the allelic frequency of the apo E gene and its correlation to the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Type 2 diabetic patients (200) were recruited from the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Program of Talca Hospital, Chile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Apo E genotype was determined by restriction fragment-length polymorphism analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A biochemical characterization was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Type 2 diabetic patients had elevated levels of glycemia, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile and BMI compared to the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The E3/3 genotype and epsilon3 allele had a higher frequency in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The E2/3 and E3/4 genotypes had higher levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> (TG) and cholesterol respectively; however, there was not any statistical relationship between them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, genotype of apo E in diabetic patients did not differ with healthy; E2/3 and E3/4 genotypes tend to have higher levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> and cholesterol respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We think that these results corroborate that in the etiology of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e>, there is more than one associate genetic marker </plain></SENT>
