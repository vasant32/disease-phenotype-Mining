<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: During the past decade, several researchers have demonstrated a higher risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in relation to lower birth weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This theory, referred to as the "thrifty phenotype" hypothesis, postulates that impaired fetal growth predisposes individuals to the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and other <z:mp ids='MP_0005266'>metabolic abnormalities</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This article examines the importance of fetal growth in the etiology of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by estimating the proportion of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> cases associated with this exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The importance of an exposure or its correlate as a potential cause of a disease can be assessed by estimating the proportion of cases that could be prevented if the exposure was eliminated from a defined population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This proportion is referred to as the population-attributable fraction (PAF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Published studies of the association between <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and birth weight were reviewed and selected for further analysis if data were presented that enabled PAF calculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, PAFs were calculated for higher birth weight cutoffs because researchers have postulated that the lowest birth weight category may not capture <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth retardation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Studies have shown that exposure classified in this broader manner can produce unbiased PAF estimates, even if many subjects are falsely classified as exposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PAFs for the lowest birth weight category ranged from 0.01 to 0.25 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this analysis, PAFs for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> did not exceed 0.35 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, &gt;50% of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> cases in the First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Epidemiologic Follow-Up Study were attributable to excess <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> as reflected by a BMI of &gt; or =26 kg/m2 (PAF &gt;0.50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Impaired fetal growth or its correlates account for a minority (&lt;0.50) of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> cases </plain></SENT>
