<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Regulators of G protein signaling (RGSs, or RGS proteins) are responsible for the subsecond turn off of G protein signaling and are inhibitors of signal transduction in vitro, but the physiological function of RGS proteins remains poorly defined in part because of functional redundancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We explore the role of RGS proteins and G alpha(i2) in the physiologic regulation of body weight and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis by studying genomic "knock-in" mice expressing RGS-insensitive G alpha(i2) with a G184S mutation that blocks RGS protein binding and GTPase acceleration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Homozygous G alpha(i2)(G184S) knock-in mice show slightly reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On a high-fat diet, male G alpha(i2)(G184S) mice are resistant to <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>, have decreased body fat, and are protected from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This appears to be a result of <z:mp ids='MP_0004889'>increased energy expenditure</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both male and female G alpha(i2)(G184S) mice on a high-fat diet also exhibit enhanced insulin sensitivity and <z:mp ids='MP_0005292'>increased glucose tolerance</z:mp> despite females having similar <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> female mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: RGS proteins and G alpha(i2) signaling play important roles in the control of insulin sensitivity and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Identification of the specific RGS proteins involved might permit their consideration as potential therapeutic targets for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
