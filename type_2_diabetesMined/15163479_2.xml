<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Prospective observational study of 344 insulin-treated subjects randomly selected from pharmacy records at three large medical centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At entry, subjects underwent an extensive psychological evaluation and then monitored their blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucoses</z:chebi> in their usual fashion for up to 52 weeks using a <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> meter capable of storing 1000 readings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucoses</z:chebi> &lt;or=3.33 mmol/l (60 mg/dl), subjects recorded the severity of symptoms in a log book </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Symptoms were scored '0' if they were asymptomatic, '1' for symptoms that were mild-to-moderate, and '2' if the subject had a diminished level of consciousness or required the assistance of others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A mean blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and mean symptom score were calculated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001988'>hypoglycemic episodes</z:hpo> detected by each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred seventy-six subjects (51.2%) had a median of 4.5 hypoglycemic events during 42.5+/-8.0 weeks of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean hypoglycemic blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucoses</z:chebi> and mean symptom scores were modestly correlated (r=0.153; P=0.043) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, symptom scores were lower in the elderly and higher in subjects with higher <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> knowledge scores, microvascular complications, and higher entry <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multiple linear regression showed that the latter three factors were independently predictive of higher symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Conventional clinical data may be useful in identifying patients with poor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> perception </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with better long- and short-term glycemic control are at higher risk and may benefit from instruction on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> aspects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
