<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanisms underlying the induction of ER stress are unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to establish whether <z:chebi fb="4" ids="26607">saturated fatty acids</z:chebi> cause defects in ER-to-Golgi protein trafficking, which may thereby contribute to ER stress via protein overload </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cells of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1522248" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">mouse insulinoma</z:e> cell line MIN6 were transfected with temperature-sensitive vesicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0010280'>stomatitis</z:hpo> virus G protein (VSVG) tagged with green fluorescent protein to quantify the rate of ER-to-Golgi protein trafficking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>I14 antibody, which detects only correctly folded VSVG, was employed to probe the folding environment of the ER </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ER stress markers were monitored by western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pretreatment with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi>, but not <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30823">oleate</z:chebi>, significantly reduced the rate of ER-to-Golgi protein trafficking assessed using VSVG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This was not secondary to ER stress, since thapsigargin, which compromises chaperone function by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of ER calcium, markedly inhibited VSVG folding and promoted strong ER stress but only slightly reduced protein trafficking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Blockade of ER-to-Golgi protein trafficking with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48080">brefeldin A</z:chebi> (BFA) was sufficient to trigger ER stress, but neither BFA nor <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> compromised VSVG folding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Reductions in ER-to-Golgi protein trafficking potentially contribute to ER stress during lipoapoptosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In this case ER stress would be triggered by protein overload, rather than a disruption of the protein-folding capacity of the ER </plain></SENT>
