<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The hemovascular abnormalities encountered in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> include platelet alterations, shifts in <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> metabolism and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521803" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">disorders of fibrinolysis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> is thus associated with increased platelet adhesiveness, <z:mp ids='MP_0009586'>increased platelet aggregation</z:mp> with hypersensitivity to proaggregants, increased plasma levels of beta-thromboglobulin and platelet factor 4 as an expression of platelet <z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo>, increased levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">thromboxane A2</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">TXA2</z:chebi>) and prostacyclin (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi>), and reduced levels of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is not clear which, if any, of these abnormalities are generated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> and can be corrected by adequate glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Studies with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi> have demonstrated that it exerts hemovascular effects which can be valuable to patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi> leads to a decrease in platelet adhesiveness and aggregability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This treatment also reduces <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26995">thromboxane</z:chebi> levels and increases <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms of action of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi> are not fully known but it has been demonstrated that its antiplatelet action is independent of its hypoglycemic activity and is not accompanied by clinical abnormalities of blood clotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of direct action on platelet activity may be mediated by inhibition of activated <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthetase, activation of adenylate cyclase, modulation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> release from platelet membranes, stimulation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi> production, and inhibition of the proaggregant action of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">TXA2</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi> not only has a hypoglycemic action but also improves hemovascular parameters in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> when used at <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> therapeutic doses </plain></SENT>
