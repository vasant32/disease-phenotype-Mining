<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Each received a single intramuscular injection of the 3 virus strains (A/Chile,A/Philippines,B/USSR) anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021400" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FLU">influenza</z:e> vaccine recommended by WHO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The antibody titre and the cell-mediated immune response to the 3 virus strains, as evaluated by the generation of activated lymphocytes and enumeration of B lymphocytes, were studied before and 18 h, 72 h and 1, 2, 3 and 6 weeks after vaccination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall, the humoral and cell-mediated immune responses were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in both groups of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, patients with Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> showed a statistically significant increase (p less than 0.01) of antibody titre of the A/Chile and an increased percentage of B lymphocytes one week after vaccination compared to age-matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four out of 21 patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had no antibody response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 virus strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant reduction (p less than 0.01) of the percentage of activated cells possessing receptors for interleukin-2 was observed 72 h after vaccination in patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared to age-matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the patients who received the vaccine developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021400" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FLU">influenza</z:e> in the course of the following year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that valid protection against the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021400" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FLU">influenza</z:e> virus can be obtained in patients with Type 1 and Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
