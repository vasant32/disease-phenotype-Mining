<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The adipokine hormone leptin triggers signals in the brain that ultimately lead to decreased feeding and <z:mp ids='MP_0004889'>increased energy expenditure</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> is most often associated with elevated plasma leptin levels and leptin resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)-3 and protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52242">PTP</z:chebi>-1B) are two endogenous inhibitors of tyrosine kinase signaling pathways and suppress both insulin and leptin signaling via different molecular mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brain-specific inactivation of these genes individually in the mouse partially protects against diet-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (DIO) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate possible genetic interactions between these two genes to determine whether combined reduction in these inhibitory activities results in synergistic, epistatic, or additive effects on energy balance control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We generated mice with combined inactivation of the genes coding for SOCS-3 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52242">PTP</z:chebi>-1B in brain cells, examined their sensitivity to hormone action, and analyzed the contribution of each gene to the resulting phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Surprisingly, the Nestin-Cre mice used to mediate gene inactivation displayed a phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, combined inactivation of SOCS-3 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52242">PTP</z:chebi>-1B in brain revealed additive effects on several parameters, including partial resistance to DIO and associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, synergistic effects were observed for body length and weight, suggesting possible compensatory mechanisms for the absence of either inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a SOCS-3-specific lean phenotype was revealed on the standard diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results show that the biological roles of SOCS-3 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52242">PTP</z:chebi>-1B do not fully overlap and that targeting both factors might improve therapeutic effects of their inhibition in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
