<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Fat metabolism is increasingly implicated in the pathogenesis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endurance training has been shown to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>hepatic steatosis</z:hpo> and to alter skeletal muscle fat metabolism, and regional free fatty acid (FFA) uptake adaptations were suggested as a mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, we tested whether endurance training modifies the uptake of plasma FFAs occurring in the liver and in skeletal muscle during anabolic, i.e., hyperinsulinemic, conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Trained and untrained healthy male subjects underwent <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography scanning of the liver and thigh regions, with the FFA analog 14(R,S)-[(18)F]fluoro-6-thia-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32365">heptadecanoic acid</z:chebi>, during euglycemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tracer influx rate constants in skeletal muscle (MK(i)) and liver (LK(i)) were multiplied by plasma FFA levels to obtain FFA uptake for skeletal muscle (MFU) and liver (LFU), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Athletes showed increased Vo(2max) (P &lt; 0.0001), insulin-mediated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal (M value, 61 +/- 4 vs. 46 +/- 3 micromol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>min(-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>kg(-1), P = 0.01), and plasma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> levels during the clamp and lower percentage of body fat mass (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MK(i) was 25% higher in athletes than in sedentary men (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects, MK(i) and MFU were positively correlated with the M value (r = 0.56, P = 0.02, and r = 0.51, P = 0.03, respectively) and with plasma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> levels (r = 0.63, P = 0.006, and r = 0.63, P = 0.005, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>LK(i) was significantly reduced by 20% in the athletes (P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>By multiple regression, LFU was inversely correlated with the two fitness categories (P = 0.008), and it was lower in athletes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Linear fitting of liver data showed time consistency, indicating no release of FFAs as a mechanism for the reduced liver retention in athletes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that endurance training promotes insulin-mediated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and FFA disposal in skeletal muscle, while lowering hepatic FFA uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Such changes may result in a divergent pattern of fat accumulation in the two organs </plain></SENT>
