<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we aimed to characterize quantitative metabolic risk phenotypes of the four variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The variants were genotyped in the population-based Inter99 cohort (n = 5,970), the ADDITION Study (n = 1,626), a population-based sample of young healthy subjects (n = 377), and in additional type 2 diabetic case (n = 2,111) and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-tolerant (n = 521) subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The case-control studies involved a total of 4,089 type 2 diabetic patients and 5,043 glucose-tolerant control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We validated association of variants near HHEX/KIF11/IDE, CDKN2A/B, and IGF2BP2 with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, in middle-aged people, the rs1111875 C-allele of HHEX/KIF11/IDE strongly associated with lower <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin response during an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (P = 6 x 10(-7)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, decreased insulin release following intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27999">tolbutamide</z:chebi> injection was observed in young healthy subjects (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also, a reduced insulin release was observed for the CDKN2A/B rs10811661 T-allele after both oral and intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> challenges (P = 0.001 and P = 0.009, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We validate that variants in the proximity of the HHEX/KIF11/IDE, CDKN2A/B, and IFG2BP2 loci associate with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Importantly, variations within the HHEX/KIF11/IDE and CDKN2A/B loci confer impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>- and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27999">tolbutamide</z:chebi>-induced insulin release in middle-aged and young healthy subjects, suggesting a role for these variants in the pathogenesis of pancreatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta-cell dysfunction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
