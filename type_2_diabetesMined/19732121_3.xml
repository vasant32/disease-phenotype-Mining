<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data from a published randomized controlled trial were used in combination with a published, validated computer simulation model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> to project clinical and cost outcomes over a time horizon of 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cost data were obtained from published literature and expert opinion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical and cost outcomes were discounted at 5% per annum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity analyses were performed to establish key drivers and parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treatment with exenatide compared with insulin glargine was projected to be associated with improvements in life expectancy of 0.016 years and quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.280 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), increased lifetime direct medical costs of euro 3854 (euro 22 095 vs. euro 18 242) and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of euro 13 746 per QALY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>If quality of life was not taken into account, exenatide was associated with an ICER of euro 238 201 per life year gained vs. insulin glargine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity analyses revealed that outcomes were most sensitive to changes in assumptions for (dis)utility values relating to weight change and the rate of self-monitored blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Exenatide was projected to be associated with similar clinical outcomes and increased costs compared with insulin glargine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Analysis of cost-effectiveness from a third-party perspective suggests that exenatide is likely to represent good value for money in the German setting </plain></SENT>
