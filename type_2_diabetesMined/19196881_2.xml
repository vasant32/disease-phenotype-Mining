<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> (LVH) and diastolic dysfunction, which may eventually lead to clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine the cardiovascular effects of adolescent-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We recruited diabetic girls (8 with type 2 and 11 with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) from a hospital <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> service and nondiabetic control subjects (9 lean and 11 overweight) from the schools of the diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography and measurements were performed by a single observer, blinded to subject group allocation, and included M-mode left ventricular dimensions, two-dimensional left ventricular mass, Doppler diastolic flows, estimation of left ventricular filling pressure, and systolic longitudinal motion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular mass was indexed to height and fat-free body mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ANOVA was used to compare the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The groups were similar in age and height, but significant differences in body composition were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had larger left ventricular dimensions and left ventricular mass, which persisted when indexed to height </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Diastolic filling was impaired in both diabetic groups, and systolic longitudinal function was lower in the type 2 diabetic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Half of the group with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> met the published criteria for LVH and left <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventricular dilatation</z:hpo>; 25% had evidence of elevated left ventricular filling pressure in association with structural abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study has demonstrated preclinical abnormalities of cardiac structure and function in adolescent girls with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, despite the short duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and highlights the potential high cardiovascular risk occurring in adolescent type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
