<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a phase II, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, 12-week dose-ranging evaluation of TAK-875 (6.25-200 mg once daily) with the primary end point of change in A1C at week 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A nonblinded group received 1 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> once daily as an active control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 396 patients were randomized to receive TAK-875 (n = 299), placebo (n = 48), or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> (n = 49) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The least square mean changes in A1C at week 12 from baseline were as follows: 0.09% in the placebo group; -0.54, -0.67, -0.88, -1.27, -1.29, and -1.40% in the 6.25-, 12.5-, 25-, 50-, 100-, and 200-mg TAK-875 groups, respectively; and -1.32% in the 1-mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> TAK-875 groups had statistically significant reductions in A1C compared with placebo (P &lt; 0.0001), and those receiving â‰¥50 mg TAK-875 achieved reductions in A1C equivalent to those with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results for other glycemic parameters, including improvements during a meal tolerance test, mirrored these positive findings with TAK-875 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in incidence of adverse events among the groups and no dose-dependent changes in tolerability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001988'>Hypoglycemic episodes</z:hpo> were reported in 0.7% of patients in the TAK-875 groups and in 4.1% of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TAK-875 produced clinically and statistically significant improvements in glycemic control in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> inadequately controlled by diet and exercise, and it was well tolerated with a lower propensity to cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
