<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These metabolic characteristics are related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> of skeletal muscle and are factors potentially related to muscle fiber type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The current study was undertaken to examine the interactions of muscle fiber type in relation to oxidative enzyme activity, glycolytic enzyme activity, and muscle <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> content in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and type 2 diabetic subjects compared with lean healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The method of single-fiber analysis was used on vastus lateralis muscle obtained by percutaneous biopsy from 22 lean, 20 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, and 20 type 2 diabetic subjects (ages 35+/-1, 42+/-2, and 52+/-2 years, respectively), with values for BMI that were similar in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and diabetic subjects (23.7+/-0.7, 33.2+/-0.8, and 31.8+/-0.8 kg/m2, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Oxidative enzyme activity followed the order of type I &gt; type IIa &gt; type IIb, but within each fiber type, skeletal muscle from <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and type 2 diabetic subjects had lower oxidative enzyme activity than muscle from lean subjects (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Muscle <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> content followed a similar pattern in relation to fiber type, and within each fiber type, muscle from <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and type 2 diabetic subjects had greater <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> content (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In summary, based on single-fiber analysis, skeletal muscle in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and type 2 diabetic subjects mani-fests disturbances of oxidative enzyme activity and increased <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> content that are independent of the effect of fiber type </plain></SENT>
