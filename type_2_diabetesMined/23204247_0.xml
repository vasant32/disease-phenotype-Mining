<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 410 patients, <z:mp ids='MP_0005163'>one eye</z:mp> per patient, fulfilled the inclusion/exclusion criteria and were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ophthalmologic examinations including best corrected visual acuity, fundus photography, and optical coherence tomography were performed at baseline, 6 months, and at the last study visit (24 months or before laser treatment).RESULTSA total of 348 eyes/patients performed the 24-month visit or developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CSME</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these 348 eyes/patients, 26 developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CSME</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HbA(1c) levels at baseline and MA turnover (i.e., the sum of the MA formation and disappearance rates) computed during the first 6 months of follow-up were found to be independently predictive factors for development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CSME</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MA turnover was 11.2 ± 11.2 in the 26 eyes/patients that developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CSME</z:e> and 5.0 ± 5.2 in the remaining 322 (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Higher MA turnover values correlated with earlier development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CSME</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MA turnover predictive values for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CSME</z:e> development were, for the positive predictive value, 20% and for the negative predictive value, 96%.CONCLUSIONSMA turnover calculated with the RetmarkerDR predicts development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CSME</z:e> in eyes with NPDR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Low MA turnover values identify well the eyes that are less likely to develop <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CSME</z:e> in a 2-year period </plain></SENT>
