<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Cross-sectional study of community-dwelling adults without known <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who had an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test and A1C measured on the same day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean age of the 2,107 participants was 69.4 +/- 11.1 years; 43% were men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on the American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association (<z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi>) criteria, 198 had previously undiagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity/specificity of A1C cut point of 6.5% was 44/79% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results were similar in age- and sex-stratified analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Given the A1C cut point of 6.5%, 85% of participants were classified as nondiabetic by <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The limited sensitivity of the A1C test may result in delayed diagnosis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, while the strict use of <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> criteria may fail to identify a high proportion of individuals with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by A1C &gt; or =6.5% or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
