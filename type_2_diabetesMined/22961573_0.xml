<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics, and safety of single-dose RM-131 in type 2 diabetic patients with gastrointestinal cardinal symptoms (GCSI) and previously documented <z:mp ids='MP_0009854'>delayed gastric emptying</z:mp> (DGE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a randomized crossover study, 10 female patients received RM-131 (100 μg s.c.) or placebo and underwent scintigraphic gastric emptying (GE) and colonic filling at 6 h (CF6) of a solid-liquid meal administered 30 min postdosing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adverse events, plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and hormonal levels were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>GCSI daily diary (GCSI-DD) was completed during treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PK was assessed in this cohort and healthy volunteers (HVs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At screening, HbA(1c) was 7.2 ± 0.4% (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) and total GCSI-DD score was 1.32 ± 0.21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RM-131 accelerated GE t(1/2) of solids (P = 0.011); mean difference (Δ) in solid GE t(1/2) was 68.3 min (95% CI 20-117) or 66.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were numerical differences in GE lag time, CF6 solids, and GE t(1/2) liquids (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With a significant (P &lt; 0.014) order effect, further analysis of the first treatment period (n = 5 per group) confirmed significant RM-131 effects on GE t(1/2) (solids, P = 0.016; liquids, P = 0.024; CF6, P = 0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PK was similar in DGE patients and HVs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were increases in 120-min blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (P = 0.07) as well as 30-90-min area under the curve (AUC) levels of growth hormone, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi>, and prolactin (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.02) with single-dose RM-131 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Only light-headedness was reported more on RM-131 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: RM-131 greatly accelerates the GE of solids in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and documented DGE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>PK is similar in diabetic patients and HVs </plain></SENT>
