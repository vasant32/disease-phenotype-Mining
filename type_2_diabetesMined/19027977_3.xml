<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to compare miglitol and miglitinide, on cystatin C levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were randomly assigned to receive 150 mg/day miglitol or 30 mg/day mitiglinide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The serum cystatin C level was measured in 36 patients (19 in the miglitol group and 17 in the mitiglinide group) undergoing meal tolerance testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>High sensitivity C reactive protein (hsCRP) was also assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 3 months of therapy, the cystatin C level did not change but the log-transformed hsCRP value decreased (3.03+/-0.32 to 2.83+/-0.34log[microg/L], P&lt;0.05) in the miglitol group, whereas in the mitiglinide group the cystatin C level increased (0.75+/-0.18 to 0.78+/-0.20mg/L, P&lt;0.05) but the hsCRP value did not change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 3 months, the levels of cystatin C and hsCRP were each correlated with the postprandial insulin level in the meal tolerance test in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that postprandial insulin secretion might increase cystatin C and that insulin-unstimulated miglitol therapy might suppress an increase in cystatin C accompanied by an anti-inflammatory effect in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
