<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Adiponectin, an adipocyte-secreted hormone, circulates in the serum in several multimeric forms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Compared with total adiponectin, high-molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin has been suggested to be a better predictor of metabolic parameters and insulin sensitivity in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to compare total adiponectin with HMW adiponectin as predictors of metabolic variables and insulin sensitivity at both baseline and after an exercise intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We obtained blood samples from 60 men and women with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (n = 20), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) (n = 20), or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 20) at baseline and after 4 weeks of training to measure metabolic variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using commercially available assays, we measured plasma total adiponectin using LINCO, Mediagnost, and ALPCO assays and HMW adiponectin using an ALPCO assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HMW adiponectin and total adiponectin (ALPCO) had similar ability to predict the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Total adiponectin, as measured by radioimmunoassay (LINCO) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Mediagnost), correlated most strongly with measures of insulin sensitivity (P &lt; 0.01) and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile (P &lt; 0.01) at baseline, showed greater improvements of adiponectin levels (P &lt; 0.001), was more closely associated with improvements of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> measures with exercise training (P &lt; 0.01), and more accurately predicted <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and IGT in comparison with total adiponectin or HMW measured with the ALPCO ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results do not support the superiority of HMW over total adiponectin (measured using currently available assays) in assessing metabolic variables at baseline or in response to physical training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, there are significant differences in the ability of commercially available assays for total adiponectin to predict metabolic variables </plain></SENT>
