<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the 3-month follow-up data of the Eat Well, Live Well Nutrition Program, a culturally specific, peer-led dietary change program designed to reduce the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in low-income African-American women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This peer-led program was delivered in the community and was tailored to the participants' stage of change for individual dietary patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report the results of the 3-month intervention and the extent to which dietary changes and other key outcomes were maintained at a 3-month follow-up assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using an experimental control group design, 294 overweight African-American women (ages 25-55 years), recruited in collaboration with a neighborhood organization, completed pre- and posttest and 3-month follow-up interviews of dietary behaviors, knowledge, attitudes, fat intake, and weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant reductions were found in fat intake among women in the treatment condition when compared with women in the control group; these reductions were maintained at 3-month follow-up assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Likewise, significant changes in dietary patterns were reported after the study and were maintained, except for one dietary pattern (replacement) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This model of health promotion, which individually tailors dietary patterns through staging and use of peer educators, has the potential for decreasing fat intake and increasing and maintaining specific low-fat dietary patterns among overweight African-American women at risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
