<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Vaspin (visceral adipose tissue-derived serpin) was first identified as an adipokine in a rat model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, in which it is predominantly secreted from visceral adipose tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Serum concentrations of vaspin show a food intake-related diurnal variation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore tested the hypothesis that vaspin plays a role in the regulation of food intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Vaspin levels in the hypothalamus and human stomach were determined by western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cerebrospinal fluid concentration of vaspin was measured in five healthy volunteers using an ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fed 11-week-old female db/db mice were given intraperitoneal injections of 1 mg/kg body weight of vaspin (n = 6) or saline (n = 6) on experimental days 1, 3 and 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Changes in food intake and fed plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations were determined after one intracerebroventricular administration of either 1 μg vaspin or artificial cerebrospinal fluid into 11-week-old female db/db (n = 8) and C57BL/6 mice (n = 8) up to 6 days after injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We detected vaspin in the hypothalamus of db/db and C57BL/6 mice and in the cerebrospinal fluid of healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both peripheral and central vaspin administration decrease food intake in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> db/db and lean C57BL/6 mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In db/db mice, vaspin treatment is associated with sustained <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering effects for at least 6 days after injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, we demonstrated expression of the gene encoding vaspin in the gastric mucosa in humans, and found that this was subject to regional variations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our data suggest a previously unrecognised role of vaspin in the regulation of food intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We postulate that vaspin inhibits a protease that degrades an anti-orexigenic factor </plain></SENT>
