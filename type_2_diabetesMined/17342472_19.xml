<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Extensive literature searching strategies were used to identify published and unpublished intervention studies that measured glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Primary study results were coded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fixed- and random-effects meta-analytic procedures included moderator analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Data were synthesised across 10,455 subjects from 103 research reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall mean weighted effect size for two-group comparisons was 0.29 (higher mean for treatment than control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This effect size is consistent with a difference in HbA1c means of 0.45% (e.g. 7.38% for treatment subjects vs 7.83% for control subjects) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For single-group studies, the overall mean weighted effect size was 0.32-0.34 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Control group subjects experienced no improvement in metabolic control during participation in the studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interventions that targeted multiple health behaviours resulted in smaller effect size estimates (0.22) than interventions that focused only on exercise behaviours (0.45) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Funded studies reported greater improvements in metabolic controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Studies with a greater proportion of female subjects reported lower effect sizes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Baseline HbA1c and BMI were unrelated to metabolic outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These findings suggest that self-management interventions that include exercise recommendations improve metabolic control, despite considerable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in the magnitude of the intervention effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Interventions that emphasise exercise may be especially effective in improving metabolic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Primary research testing interventions in randomised trials to confirm causal relationships would be constructive </plain></SENT>
