<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 57 overweight (BMI &gt;or=27 kg/m2) sedentary men and women aged 40-80 years with established (&gt;6 months) type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Initially, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants attended a twice-weekly 2-month supervised resistance training program conducted in the exercise laboratory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, participants undertook a resistance training maintenance program (2 times/week) for 12 months and were randomly assigned to carry this out either in a community fitness and recreation center (center) or in their domestic environment (home) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Glycemic control (HbA1c [A1C]) was assessed at 0, 2, and 14 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pooling data from the two groups for the 2-month supervised resistance training program showed that compared with baseline, mean A1C fell by -0.4% [95% CI -0.6 to -0.2] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Within-group comparisons showed that A1C remained lower than baseline values at 14 months in the center group (-0.4% [-0.7 to -0.03]) but not in the home group (-0.1% [-0.4 to 0.3]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, no between-group differences were observed at each time point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Changes in A1C during the maintenance period were positively associated with exercise adherence in the center group only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Center-based but not home-based resistance training was associated with the maintenance of modestly improved glycemic control from baseline, which was proportional to program adherence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our findings emphasize the need to develop and test behavioral methods to promote healthy lifestyles including increased physical activity in adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
