<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The SLC2A10 gene encodes the GLUT10 facilitative <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transporter, which is expressed in high amounts in liver and pancreas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The gene is mapped to chromosome 20q12-q13.1, a region that has been shown to be linked to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The gene was examined in 61 Danish type 2 diabetic patients, and a total of six variants (-27C--&gt;T, Ala206Thr, Ala272Ala, IVS2 + 10G--&gt;A, IVS4 + 18T--&gt;G, and IVS4 + 26G--&gt;A) were identified and investigated in an association study, which included 503 type 2 diabetic patients and 510 glucose-tolerant control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>None of the variants were associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, carriers of the codon 206 Thr allele had 18% lower fasting serum insulin levels (P = 0.002) and 20% lower insulinogenic index (P = 0.03) than homozygous carriers of the Ala allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that variation in the coding region of SLC2A10 does not contribute substantially to the pathogenesis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the examined study population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the codon 206 polymorphism may be related to the interindividual variation in fasting and oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced serum insulin levels </plain></SENT>
