<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Of 32,826 women from the Nurses' Health Study who provided blood at baseline, we followed 929 women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During 10 years of follow-up, we documented 124 incident cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> (CHD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After adjustment for age, smoking, BMI, and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, the relative risks (RRs) comparing extreme quartiles of soluble TNF-alpha receptor II (sTNF-RII) were 2.48 (95% CI 1.08-5.69; P = 0.034) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) and 2.02 (1.17-3.48; P = 0.003) for total CHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The probability of developing CHD over 10 years was higher among diabetic subjects with substantially higher levels of both sTNF-RII (&gt;75th percentile) and HbA(1c) (&gt;7%), compared with diabetic subjects with lower levels (25% vs. 7%, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diabetic subjects with only higher sTNF-RII or HbA(1c) had similar (16-17%) risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate model, diabetic subjects with higher levels of both sTNF-RII and HbA(1c) had an RR of 3.66 (1.85-7.22) for MI and 3.03 (1.82-5.05) for total CHD, compared with those with lower levels of both biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Increased levels of sTNF-RII were strongly associated with risk of CHD among diabetic women, independent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
