<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This may be relevant to race-specific differences in susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether alterations in <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzyme activity could account for this biochemical phenotype and examined the relationship with conventional markers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Two hundred seventeen individuals were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 75) of African and Caucasian origin were matched by sex and racial origin with healthy control subjects (n = 142) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma total <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase (GPx) activity were spectrophotometrically measured, and total cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> were measured by enzymatic methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SOD activity was higher and GPx activity lower in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than in healthy control subjects (573 +/- 515 vs. 267 +/- 70 units/l, P &lt; 0.001 and 150 +/- 93 vs. 178 +/- 90 units/l, P = 0.019, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients of African origin with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had lower GPx and higher SOD activity compared with Caucasian patients (126 +/- 82 vs. 172 +/- 97 units/l, P = 0.03 and 722 +/- 590 vs. 445 +/- 408 units/l, P = 0.002, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients of African origin with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> urinary albumin excretion had significantly higher plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> concentrations (100.7 +/- 14.2 vs. 88.1 +/- 14.9 micromol/l, P = 0.007) and lower GPx activity (99.0 +/- 72.4 vs. 173.7 +/- 107.4 units/l, P = 0.02) compared with those of Caucasian origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>African origin was an independent predictor of elevated SOD (P = 0.007) and reduced GPx activity (P = 0.02) in regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SOD and GPx enzyme activities vary according to race and could account for differences in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35923">hydroperoxide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In patients of African origin, susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal disease</z:e> may be associated with lowered GPx activity </plain></SENT>
