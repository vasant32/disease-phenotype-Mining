<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (DR) may be the most common of these and is a leading cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000505'>visual impairment</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo> among working age adults in developed nations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Many large-scale type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> clinical trials have demonstrated that early intensive glycemic control can reduce the incidence and progression of micro and macrovascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, epidemiological and prospective data have revealed that the stressors of diabetic vasculature persist beyond the point when glycemic control has been achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These kinds of persistent adverse effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> on the development and progression of complications has been defined as "metabolic memory", and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, advanced glycation end products and epigenetic changes have been implicated in the process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have indicated that such "hyperglycemic memory" may also influence DR, suggesting that manipulation of hyperglycemic memory may prove a beneficial approach to prevention and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This review summarizes the evidence from DR-related clinical trials and mechanistic studies to investigate the significance of metabolic memory in DR and understand its potential as a target of molecular therapeutics aimed at reversing hyperglycemic memory </plain></SENT>
