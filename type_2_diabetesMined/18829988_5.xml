<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this serial intracoronary ultrasound (IVUS) study, 237 coronary segments from 45 patients enrolled in the DIABETES I, II, and III trials were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Quantitative volumetric IVUS analyses (motorized pullbacks at 0.5 mm/s) were performed in the same coronary segment after the index procedure and at the 9-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nontreated mild lesions (angiographic stenosis &lt;25%) with &gt; or =0.5 mm plaque thickening and length of &gt; or =5 mm assessed by IVUS were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vessel shrinkage was defined as a Deltaexternal elastic membrane area/Deltaplaque area &lt; 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Statistical adjustment by multiple segments and multiple lesions per patient was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Vessel shrinkage was identified in 37.1% of segments and was associated with a significant decrease in lumen area at 9 months (vessel shrinkage, 10 +/- 4 mm(2) vs. non-vessel shrinkage, 11 +/- 4 mm(2); P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Independent predictors of vessel shrinkage were insulin requirements (odds ratio 4.6 [95% CI 1.40-15.10]; P = 0.01), glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (1.5 [1.05-2.10]; P = 0.02), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B (0.96 [0.94-0.98]; P &lt; 0.001), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (3.7 [1.40-10.30]; P = 0.009), number of diseased vessels (5.6 [2.50-12.50]; P &lt; 0.001), and prior revascularization (17.5 [6.50-46.90]; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This serial IVUS study suggests that progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may be mainly attributed to vessel shrinkage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Besides, vessel shrinkage is influenced by insulin requirements and metabolic control and is associated with more advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0004929'>coronary atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
