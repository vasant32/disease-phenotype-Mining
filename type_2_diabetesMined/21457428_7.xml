<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An ascending single oral-dose phase 1 study investigated safety, tolerability and pharmacodynamics of canagliflozin in healthy men (N = 63) randomized to receive canagliflozin (n = 48) or placebo (n = 15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Canagliflozin (10, 30, 100, 200, 400, 600 or 800 mg q.d. or 400 mg b.i.d.) was administered to eight cohorts (six subjects/cohort: canagliflozin; two subjects/cohort: placebo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dose dependently, canagliflozin decreased calculated 24-h mean RT(G) with maximal reduction to approximately 60 mg/dl, and increased mean 24-h UGE </plain></SENT>
