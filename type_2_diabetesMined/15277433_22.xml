<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether these genetic markers are determinants of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD) in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 376 consecutive type 2 diabetic patients were studied: 142 case subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242231" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary stenosis</z:e> &gt;50% or previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and 234 control subjects with no symptoms, no electrocardiogram (ECG) signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e>, and a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ECG stress test (n = 189) and/or (n = 45) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242231" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary stenosis</z:e> &lt;or=50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No association with CAD was observed for the +45 SNP (P = 0.48) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By contrast, a significant association was observed for the +276 SNP, with T/T homozygotes having a lower risk of CAD than carriers of other genotypes (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.13 [95% CI 0.037-0.46], P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A similarly protective effect of the +276 T/T genotype was observed in 110 case and 45 control subjects for whom the CAD status had been determined by angiography (0.04 [0.006-0.30], P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum adiponectin, although clearly related to several features of the proatherogenic/insulin-resistant phenotype, was not different between control subjects and CAD patients (26 +/- 17 vs. 25 +/- 13 microg/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the +276 G&gt;T polymorphism is a determinant of CAD risk in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This marker may assist in the identification of diabetic individuals at especially high risk of CAD, so that preventive programs can be targeted at these subjects </plain></SENT>
