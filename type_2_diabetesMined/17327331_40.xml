<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We reported strong relations between serum concentrations of persistent organic pollutants (POPs), especially organochlorine (OC) pesticides or nondioxin-like polychlorinated <z:chebi fb="21" ids="22888">biphenyls</z:chebi> (PCBs), and prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a U.S population with background exposure to POPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigated POPs and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, a frequent pathogenic precursor of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Serum POPs and homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-IR) were investigated cross-sectionally in 749 nondiabetic participants aged &gt; or = 20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nineteen POPs in five subclasses were selected, detectable in &gt; or = 60% of participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among subclasses, OC pesticides were most strongly associated with HOMA-IR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adjusted geometric means of HOMA were 3.27, 3.36, 3.48, and 3.85 (P for trend &lt;0.01) across quartiles of OC pesticides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relationship strengthened with increasing HOMA-IR percentile: adjusted odds ratios comparing the highest versus lowest POPs quartile were 1.8 for being &gt; or = 50th percentile of HOMA-IR, 4.4 for being &gt; or = 75th percentile, and 7.5 for being &gt; or = 90th percentile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Associations with elevated HOMA-IR appeared to be specific to oxychlordane and trans-nonachlor but also were found for two nondioxin-like PCBs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No HOMA-IR associations were seen in the other three POP subclasses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The association between OC pesticides and HOMA-IR tended to strengthen as waist circumference increased, with no apparent association in the lowest quartile of OC <z:chebi fb="239" ids="25944">pesticide</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings, coupled with those concerning <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevalence, suggest that OC pesticides and nondioxin-like PCBs may be associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk by increasing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, and POPs may interact with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> to increase the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
