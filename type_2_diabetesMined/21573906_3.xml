<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The abundance of connexin (Cx) 37, 40 and 43 was assessed by western blot and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Renal haemodynamics was characterised with GAP <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi>, which are Cx mimetics, to inhibit gap junctions as a probe in both strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ZDF rats exhibited higher plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, 8-epi-<z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> F2Î± excretion, renal plasma flow and GFR than ZL rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In ZDF rat kidney phosphorylation of Cx43 was enhanced compared with that in ZL rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical study revealed that the density of abundance of Cx37 in renin-secreting cells was significantly reduced in ZDF rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although renal autoregulation was markedly impaired in ZDF rats, it was preserved in ZL rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>GAP27 for Cx37,43 and for Cx40 impaired renal autoregulation in ZL rats, but failed to induce further alterations in renal autoregulation in ZDF rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our findings indicate that ZDF rats have glomerular hyperfiltration with impaired autoregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>They also demonstrate enhanced phosphorylation of Cxs and reduced production of Cxs in ZDF rat kidney, especially of Cx37 in renin-secreting cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Finally, our data suggest that an impairment of gap junctional communication in juxtaglomerular apparatus plays a role in altered renal autoregulation in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
