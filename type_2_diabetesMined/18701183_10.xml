<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The use of a real time continuous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring system (RT-CGM) was studied as a behavior modification tool and the effectiveness of a RT-CGM in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control for patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a prospective, open-label, randomized, controlled clinical trial in 65 patients with poorly controlled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (8.0&lt;/=HbA1c&lt;/=10%) over a 3-month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The intervention group was monitored monthly with a RT-CGM (three days at a time for 3 months) and the control group continued self-monitoring blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (SMBG) at least four times a week for 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The HbA1c of the RT-CGM group was significantly reduced after 12 weeks compared with the SMBG group (9.1+/-1.0% to 8.0+/-1.2% vs. 8.7+/-0.7% to 8.3+/-1.1%, respectively; P=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the RT-CGM group, there was a significant reduction in total daily calorie intake, weight, body mass index (BMI), and postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level, and a significant increase in total exercise time per week after 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that the RT-CGM was useful in modifying a patient's diet and exercise habits and could induce better glycemic control than SMBG for patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
