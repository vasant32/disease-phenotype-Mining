<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This 6-month intervention study included 21 patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM) requiring insulin therapy with <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA1c) &gt; 7% and with a body mass index (b.m.i.) &gt; 27 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects were enrolled in a 6-month lifestyle intervention programme and randomized to placebo or RSG 4 mg/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Participation in the lifestyle programme included meal replacements, increased intake of fruits and vegetables and increased daily physical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Measured end-points included body weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, HbA1c and serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, before entry into the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The baseline mean b.m.i. was 36.4 and the mean HbA1c was 9.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The greatest weight losses occurred during the first 12 weeks (19 lbs for RSG, 13.4 lbs for placebo) with a greater <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> at each point for the group receiving RSG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Waist circumference declined by 2.8 and 4.0 inches for the placebo and RSG groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Systolic BP declined 16.2 mmHg in the placebo group and 14.3 mmHg in the RSG group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Diastolic blood pressure decreased by 12.8 mmHg in the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>HbA1c was reduced significantly by 1.3% for the placebo group and 1.1% in the RSG group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: This study demonstrates the benefits of lifestyle intervention using meal replacements and increased physical activity with resultant modest <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> in long-standing, poorly controlled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RSG did not impede <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and, in fact, amplified some of the positive benefits of lifestyle intervention </plain></SENT>
