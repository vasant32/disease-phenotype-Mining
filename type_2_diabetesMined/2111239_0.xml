<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To clarify the problem we performed a randomized double-blind placebo controlled crossover study of insulin treatment for 4 weeks in diabetic patients (n = 18, age 52-74 years) who were unsatisfactorily controlled by oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients continued to use these agents during the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Special attention was given to informing the patients about the trial and, in particular, about self-monitoring the blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> by the use of a reflectance meter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Insulin treatment produced the following significant changes: decreases in blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (at 7.00, 10.00, 16.00), mean daily blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, HbA1, urinary <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>) cholesterol and increased postglucose immunoreactive insulin (IRI) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significant changes were also observed during the placebo periods: decreases in HbA1 urinary <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (but not in blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therapy with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020459" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">insulin increased</z:e> the body weight, whereas the placebo insulin had the opposite effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The finding emphasizes the importance of using not only a run-in period but also a placebo design when the metabolic effects of antidiabetes therapy are to be evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The study indicates that insulin therapy for patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> can be initiated at home </plain></SENT>
