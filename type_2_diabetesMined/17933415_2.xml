<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to investigate the association of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> with the pulsatility index (PI) of cerebral arteries in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared a group of 90 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-free, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and an age- and sex-matched control group of 45 healthy subjects without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We then evaluated the PI of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) by transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> was determined by a short insulin tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The PI was significantly higher in diabetic patients than in healthy controls (p&lt;0.05) and also higher in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> than that seen in insulin sensitive diabetic patients (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The PI of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was significantly correlated with age (R=0.465, p&lt;0.01), duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (R=0.264, p=0.025) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (R=0.285, p=0.015) and inversely correlated with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> index (Kitt: R=-0.359, p=0.030) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A multiple regression analysis was performed with PI as the dependent variable and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> as an independent variable along with known clinical risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Age (beta=0.393, p&lt;0.01) and duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (beta=0.274, p=0.043) exhibited a significant independent contribution to PI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PI could be a useful marker in the detection of diabetic cerebrovascular changes, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> showed correlations with PI, but age and the duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> contributed independently to the variability in the PI </plain></SENT>
