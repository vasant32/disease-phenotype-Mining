<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The drugs are primarily used in clinical practice in the treatment of patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, a disorder of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> that occurs when the pancreatic beta-cells are unable to produce adequate amounts of insulin to maintain euglycaemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Loss of pancreatic beta-cell function in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is progressive and often precedes overt <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by 10 years or more, as was shown by the United Kingdom Prospective <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Any therapeutic or preventive approach that would limit or reverse loss of beta-cell function in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> would have profound effects on the morbidity associated with this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0849867" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">widespread disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Evidence suggesting a potential role of TZDs in preserving beta-cell function in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> as well as the ability of these agents to exert anti-inflammatory and proapoptotic anticancer effects, and their ability to promote cellular proliferation in various organs is reviewed </plain></SENT>
