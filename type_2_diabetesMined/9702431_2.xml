<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence and the rate of reversion of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> to a nondiabetic status in the 7- to 8-year follow-up of the San Antonio Heart Study, and to determine the influence of the recent 1997 American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association (<z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi>) criteria for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on these rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Individuals who revert have been problematic for those developing criteria for the diagnosis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Few studies have addressed this issue using 1979 National <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Data Group/1980 World Health Organization (WHO) criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 3,682 Mexican-American and non-Hispanic white men and nonpregnant women who completed both the baseline and follow-up examination of the San Antonio Heart Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Incidence and reversion rates were calculated using both the 1980 WHO and the 1997 ADA criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for reversion were identified, and the best fitting model using multiple logistic regression was determined using both the 1980 WHO and the 1997 ADA criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Using the 1997 ADA criteria, the age-adjusted incidences of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for Mexican-American men and women were 10.8 and 12.2%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For non-Hispanic white men and women, the age-adjusted incidence rates were 5.5 and 5.1%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similar age-adjusted incidences were recorded using the 1980 WHO criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The reversion rate for individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 11.5% using the 1980 WHO criteria and 12.5% using the 1997 ADA criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These rates were not significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Numerous risk factors for reversion were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The best fitting model, after controlling for age, sex, and ethnicity, included baseline 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level, baseline <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, and previous diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The models were the same for both the 1980 WHO and the 1997 ADA criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant difference in the incidence or the reversion rates for diabetic subjects using either 1980 WHO or 1997 ADA criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In addition, the risk factors for reversion were very similar using either set of criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The revision of the <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> criteria did not have a significant influence on reversion in this study </plain></SENT>
