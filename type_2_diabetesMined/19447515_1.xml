<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighteen Arabian and 14 Swedish women participated in a supervised 6-month resistance training and aerobic program of moderate intensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity and VO(2max) were measured at entry to the study and after 3 and 6 months training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 6 months exercise, insulin sensitivity (M-value) increased (2.7+/-1.4 mg kg(-1) min(-1) vs. 3.4+/-2 mg kg(-1) min(-1), p&lt;0.05) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and accounted for by an increase in non-oxidative <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism (0.3+/-1.1 mg kg(-1) min(-1) vs. 1.5+/-1.5 mg kg(-1) min(-1), p&lt;0.005) with no significant difference between the ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Notably, significant improvement in HbA1c was only seen in the Swedish patients who achieved greater exercise intensity (73.3+/-4.8% vs. 63.3+/-5.2% of maximum heart rate, p&lt;0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No changes were observed regarding VO(2max) or <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although a 6-month exercise intervention of moderate intensity in Arabian and Swedish patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> can improve insulin sensitivity it is hampered by the metabolic inflexibility of switching between oxidation of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> or fat </plain></SENT>
