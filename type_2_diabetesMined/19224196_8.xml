<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The value of diagnostic categories of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> for predicting type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is much debated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore sought to estimate relative and population-attributable risk of different definitions based on fasting (impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> [IFG]) or 2 h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> [IGT]) and to describe the associated clinical phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively observed a population-based cohort of 1,963 non-diabetic participants (mean age 47 years), in whom an OGTT was performed at baseline and 7 years later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IGT was fivefold more prevalent (13.5%) than IFG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In both categories, participants were older, heavier, hyperinsulinaemic, hyperproinsulinaemic and dyslipidaemic compared with participants with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Relative risk of incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was similar for IFG and IGT categories (3.73 [95% CI: 2.18-6.39] and 4.01 [95% CI: 3.12-5.14], respectively), but the population-attributable risk was fivefold higher for IGT (29% [95% CI: 26-32]) than for IFG (6% [95% CI: 5-7]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Isolated IFG carried no increase in risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lowering the threshold to 5.6 mmol/l raised the population-attributable risk of IFG to 23% (95% CI: 20-25); its contribution to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> progression, however, was largely due to co-existent IGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis adjusting for sex, age, familial <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and BMI, fasting and 2 h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> were independent predictors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Fasting and 2 h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> values are independent predictors of incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Isolated IFG is not a high-risk condition; lowering the diagnostic threshold increases the population-attributable risk of IFG fourfold, but performing an OGTT captures additional <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> progressors compared with the number identified by IFG </plain></SENT>
