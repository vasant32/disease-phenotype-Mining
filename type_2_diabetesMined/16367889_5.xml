<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe the outcome of 35 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prospectively followed for 6 years after the addition of a thiazolidinedione (TZD) to a failing regimen of a sulphonylurea and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> -- triple oral therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Study patients were assessed for the need for the addition of insulin to their regimen, and follow-up clinical and laboratory findings were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At a mean follow-up of 72 +/- 1.5 months (range 53-80), 18 (51%) of patients remained well controlled on triple oral therapy with a mean glycosylated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA1c) value of 6.9 +/- 0.2% (upper limit of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> 6.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 17 other patients, triple oral therapy failed and the use of insulin was necessary after a mean duration of 38 (range 18-68) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean HbA1c in these patients was 8.0 +/- 0.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The group that was maintained on triple oral therapy gained 15.2 +/- 1.9 lbs over the 6-year study which was significantly higher than the baseline weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, the group that failed and had insulin added to their therapy gained 20.2 +/- 4.5 lbs over the same period which was also significantly different from baseline but not from the triple oral therapy group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although after 3 years a trend towards <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> occurred in the triple oral therapy group, the insulin-added group continued to gain weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Stimulated C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels increased significantly in the triple therapy group from 3.6 +/- 0.9 to 4.3 +/- 1.2 ng/ml and had not increased or decreased non-significantly from 3.7 +/- 0.8 to 3.2 +/- 0.6 ng/ml at the time of insulin initiation in the insulin-requiring group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: When used late in the course of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, TZDs result in improved and prolonged glycaemic control which persisted for a median time of 6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>Weight gain</z:mp> with TZDs peaks and then plateaus (and even trends downwards) at 3 years, although the addition of insulin to a failing oral therapy regimen results in a further and continuing <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> in spite of inferior glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Continuing glycaemic control with triple oral therapy is dependent on preservation or augmentation of endogenous insulin production </plain></SENT>
