<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of LY2189265 (LY), a novel, long-acting glucagen-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 analogue, administered once weekly to subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a placebo-controlled, parallel-group, subject- and investigator-blind study of LY in subjects (N = 43) with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> controlled with diet and exercise alone or with a single oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects taking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> continued on their therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi>, repaglinide or nateglinide were switched to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> prior to enrollment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects received five once-weekly doses of 0.05, 0.3, 1, 3, 5 or 8 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Effects on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> concentrations were determined during fasting and following standard test meals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pharmacokinetics of LY and its effects on HBA1c, glucagon, body weight, gastric emptying and safety parameters were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Once-weekly administration of LY significantly reduced (p &lt; 0.01) fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, 2-h post-test meal postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and area under the curve (AUC) of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> after test meals at doses â‰¥1 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These effects were seen after the first dose and were sustained through the weekly dosing cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most doses produced statistically significant increases in insulin and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> AUC when normalized for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> AUC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Statistically significant reductions in HBA1c were observed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> dose groups except 0.3 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The most commonly reported adverse effects (AEs) were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> (35 events), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (20 events), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> (18 events) and diarrhoea (8 events) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LY showed improvement in fasting and postprandial glycaemic parameters when administered once weekly in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The pharmacokinetics and safety profiles also support further investigation of this novel agent </plain></SENT>
