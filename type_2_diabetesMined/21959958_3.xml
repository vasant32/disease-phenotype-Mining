<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Linear regression was used to estimate and compare the relationship between age and BMI at diagnosis among 51,920 men and 43,137 women included in a population-based <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> register in Scotland for whom an index BMI measurement was taken within 1 year of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also examined HbA(1c) values by sex within the same timescale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean BMI closest to date of diagnosis of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> was 31.83 kg/m(2) (SD 5.13) in men and 33.69 kg/m(2) (SD 6.43) in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The inverse relationship between age and BMI at diagnosis of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> was significantly steeper in women than in men (slope estimate in men -0.12 kg/m(2) per year [95% CI -0.13, -0.12] women -0.18 kg/m(2) per year [95% CI -0.18, -0.17], p &lt; 0.0001 for formal test of interaction) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean BMI difference was most marked at younger ages and narrowed with advancing age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, HbA(1c) levels within 1 year of diagnoses were broadly similar in men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Men are diagnosed with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at lower BMI than women across the age range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This observation may help explain why type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is more common among middle-aged men in populations of European extraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Whether the same pattern is also observed in other ethnic groups requires confirmation </plain></SENT>
