<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the effect of 100,000 and 200,000 IU doses of <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi>(3) on endothelial function, blood pressure and markers of glycaemic control in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a randomised, parallel group, placebo-controlled trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels &lt;100 nmol/l were enrolled from community and hospital-based <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> clinics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Participants were assessed in a university department of clinical pharmacology and received a single oral dose of placebo or <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi>(3) (100,000 IU or 200,000 IU) at baseline, randomly allocated via numbered bottles prepared offsite; participants and investigators were both blinded to treatment allocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endothelial function, office blood pressure, B-type natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and glycosylated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> were measured at baseline, and at 8 and 16 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We randomised 61 participants to the three groups (placebo 22, 100,000 IU <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi>(3) 19, 200,000 IU <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi>(3) 20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the primary outcome of endothelial function at 8 weeks (placebo 5.2%, n = 22; 100,000 IU 4.3%, n = 19; 200,000 IU 4.9%, n = 17) or at 16 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo> and glycosylated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> did not improve with either dose of <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi>(3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On covariate analysis, systolic blood pressure was significantly lower in both treatment arms than in the placebo group at 8 weeks (placebo 146.4 mmHg, 100,000 IU 141.4 mmHg [p = 0.04 vs placebo], 200,000 IU 136.8 mmHg [p = 0.03 vs placebo]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>B-type natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels were significantly lower in the 200,000 IU group by 16 weeks (placebo 34 pg/ml, 200,000 IU 21 pg/ml, p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No significant excess of adverse effects was noted in the treatment arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: High-dose <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi>(3) improved systolic blood pressure and B-type natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels, but not endothelial function, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> or glycosylated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
