<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: We examined whether age of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> is related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> DNA content in peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: PBMCs were isolated from 65 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To minimise age as a confounder, only patients aged &gt;or=50 years were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sample <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> DNA (mtDNA) content was determined by amplification of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> gene CYT-B (also known as MT-CYB) and adjusted for single-copy nuclear control genes (36B4 [also known as RPLPO] and GAPDH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Age of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> ranged from 25 to 69 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a significant positive relationship between age of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in quartiles and mtDNA content for the whole group (p = 0.02 for trend) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When stratified by the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> complications, a strong positive relationship was observed between age of diagnosis and mtDNA content for participants without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> (r = 0.7; p = 0.0002), but not for those with complications (r = -0.04; p = 0.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis confirmed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> and complication status as independent determinants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was co-linearity between <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> and disease duration, with similar relationships also seen between duration and mtDNA content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: An earlier age of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> is associated with a lower PBMC mtDNA content, but only in patients without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This may reflect a differing biology of PBMC mtDNA in those with early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and those who are prone to complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>PBMC mtDNA <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> may accelerate <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>; however the independent effect of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration remains to be evaluated </plain></SENT>
