<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aim to investigate Turkish type 2 diabetic patients with/without diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> and healthy group and examined the contribution of the G/C exon 2 and T/C exon 6 of the PPAR gamma gene polymorphism to the development of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The PPAR gamma genotypes were determined retrospectively in 43 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> and 48 without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> and a control group of 50 healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genotyping of the G/C exon 2 and T/C exon 6 of the PPAR-gamma gene polymorphism for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> individuals was performed by melting curve analysis of the generated amplicons after real-time online PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: This genotype (exon 2 and exon 6) distribution did not differ between control subjects and type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The genotype frequencies and allele exon 2 were CC, 100%; GC, 0%; GG, 0% and C, 100%; G, 0% in diabetic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> versus CC, 97.9%; GC, 2.1%; GG, 0% and C 98.9%, G 1.1% in those without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Genotype exon 6 frequencies in diabetic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> were (T/T) 0%, (T/C) 14%; (C/C) 86% versus (G/G) 0%; (G/C) 2.1%; (C/C) 97.9% in those without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The PPAR gamma exon 2 and exon 6 genotype and allele frequencies were not different between diabetic patients with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PPAR gamma exon 2 and exon 6 gene polymorphism is not associated with the development of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in Turkish type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
