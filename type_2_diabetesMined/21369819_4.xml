<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We genotyped 14 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 13 candidate loci that had previously been identified by genome-wide association meta-analyses for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> measures in Europeans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genotyping was done in 18,264 participants from two general Japanese populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For SNPs showing an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> association in Japanese individuals, we further examined <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> associations in up to 6,781 cases and 7,307 controls from a subset of the original, as well as from additional populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> associations (p &lt; 0.1 two-tailed, concordant direction with previous reports) were replicated for 11 SNPs from the following ten loci in Japanese participants: SEC16B, TMEM18, GNPDA2, BDNF, MTCH2, BCDIN3D-FAIM2, SH2B1-ATP2A1, FTO, MC4R and KCTD15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The strongest effect was observed at TMEM18 rs4854344 (p = 7.1 × 10(-7) for BMI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the 11 SNPs showing significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> association, six were also associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (OR 1.05-1.17; p = 0.04-2.4 × 10(-7)) after adjustment for BMI in the Japanese </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When meta-analysed with data from the previous reports, the BMI-adjusted <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> association was found to be highly significant for the FTO locus in East Asians (OR 1.13; 95% CI 1.09-1.18; p = 7.8 × 10(-10)) with substantial inter-ethnic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> (p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We confirmed that ten candidate loci are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> measures in the general Japanese populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Six (of ten) loci exert diabetogenic effects in the Japanese, although relatively modest in size, and independently of <z:mp ids='MP_0010024'>increased adiposity</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
