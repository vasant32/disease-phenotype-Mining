<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Many patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> require insulin therapy for improved glycemic control after beta-cell failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, many physicians are reluctant to institute insulin therapy in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for fear of accelerating <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The epidemiological evidence is reasonably sound that <z:mp ids='MP_0002079'>hyperinsulinism</z:mp> correlates with increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> in nondiabetic people and those with early type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is much less clear, however, that insulin concentration plays a negative role when less well controlled <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The data are more consistent, in fact, with the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> hypothesis, i.e., that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> is a risk factor, although the magnitude of the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> effect is not well defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Certainly, the dysmetabolism associated with poor glycemic control could increase the risk of macrovascular events through well-known mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There is direct evidence that insulin therapy can reduce the risk of macrovascular events by improving glycemic control and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemias</z:e>, although the beneficial effects may be significantly compromised by excessive <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Insulin therapy does not appear to induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> independent of changes in body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that optimal glycemic control confers a known benefit and can only be achieved with insulin therapy in some people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In these circumstances, the use of insulin has a net benefit on cardiovascular risk, mediated primarily through improvement in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> and glycemia itself </plain></SENT>
