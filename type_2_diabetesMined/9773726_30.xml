<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To provide a context for the interpretation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003128'>lactic acidosis</z:hpo> risk among patients using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, we measured rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003128'>lactic acidosis</z:hpo> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> before <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> was approved for use in the U.S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using electronic databases of hospital discharge diagnoses and laboratory results maintained by a large, nonprofit health maintenance organization (HMO). we identified possible <z:hpo ids='HP_0003128'>lactic acidosis</z:hpo> events in three geographically and racially diverse populations with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We then reviewed hard-copy clinical records to confirm and describe each event and determine its likely cause(s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From &gt;41.000 person-years of experience, we found four confirmed, three possible, and three borderline cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003128'>lactic acidosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In each case, we identified at least one severe medical condition that could have caused the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The annual confirmed event rate is similar to published rates of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0003128'>lactic acidosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0003128'>Lactic acidosis</z:hpo> occurs regularly, although infrequently, among persons with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, at rates similar to its occurrence among <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> users </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The medical conditions with which both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>-associated and naturally occurring <z:hpo ids='HP_0003128'>lactic acidosis</z:hpo> co-occur are also its potential causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The observed association between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003128'>lactic acidosis</z:hpo> may be coincidental rather than causal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This possibility merits further study </plain></SENT>
