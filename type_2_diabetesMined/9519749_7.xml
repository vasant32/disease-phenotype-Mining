<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the long-term effect of picotamide on urinary albumin excretion (UAE) at rest and induced by exercise in 30 type 2 diabetic patients who were normotensive and had <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> while at rest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The subjects of our study had a mean age of 52.5 +/- 1.6 years, BMI of 28.5 +/- 0.7 kg/m2, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration of 9.1 +/- 1.8 years, and HbA1c of 7.0 +/- 0.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study was a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were randomly allocated to receive for 1 year either picotamide, 300 mg, 3 tablets/day, or placebo, 3 tablets/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients were asked to visit our outpatient clinic after 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> times, blood pressure, <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> at rest, blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, serum picotamide, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance were measured; at baseline and after 6 and 12 months, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients underwent submaximal physical exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 6 months of picotamide, baseline and exercise-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> were significantly decreased (up to one-third) as compared with the baseline and placebo level, with no further drops at month 12 of picotamide treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On placebo treatment, UAE at rest and after exercise was slightly increased compared with baseline values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The effects of picotamide occurred without significant side effects or changes in either blood pressure levels or glycometabolic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our study is the first long-term intervention trial in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> showing that an antithromboxane agent is able to decrease <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp>, which in this disease is a dual marker of macro- and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microangiopathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest an important role for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26995">thromboxane</z:chebi> in the pathophysiology of <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; moreover, we hypothesize that antithromboxane agents may have a place in the treatment/prevention of both macro- and microvascular complications in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
