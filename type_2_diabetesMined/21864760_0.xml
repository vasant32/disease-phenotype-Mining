<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goals of self-management education are to optimize metabolic control, prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> complications, and optimize quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The keystone to successful management is to involve the patient in his treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clearly, factors other than knowledge and effective therapies affect the behaviors of patients and health care professionals and influence their ability to make optimal use of available treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The DAWN study has shown that both health care providers and patients may have a negative attitude toward starting insulin therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are very often reluctant to accept insulin therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The reasons most commonly encountered, for this negative attitude are: Patients blame themselves, for they consider that starting insulin therapy would indicate they had "failed" proper <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For some patients taking insulin means life will be more restricted or it means they have reached their last resort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fear of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> is a very common barrier for insulin therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Physicians may, unconsciously, negatively influence their patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For some physicians putting his patient on insulin, means that he has failed to control his patient's <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on oral agents and now has to force him in a troublesome therapeutic regime </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In order to overcome these barriers, health care professionals, rather than trying to "convince" their patients of the necessity of the treatment, should assess, by active listening, the precise reason for which his/her patient denies it </plain></SENT>
