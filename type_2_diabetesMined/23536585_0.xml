<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intermittent <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> (IH), a technique improving the adaptation to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>, might improve cardiorespiratory reflexes and, ultimately, blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We tested whether a single bout of IH could initiate a long-lasting response potentially leading to better adaptation to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSIn 14 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> without autonomic complications, we measured blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, chemoreflex (hypoxic and hypercapnic ventilatory responses, ventilatory recruitment threshold), and baroreflex sensitivity before, immediately after, and 3 and 6 h after a 1-h single bout of IH (6-min breathing of 13% oxygen mixture 5 times each separated by 6-min recovery) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The measurements were repeated on a placebo day (at least 1 week apart, in random sequence) when subjects were only breathing room air (single-blind protocol).RESULTSIH significantly increased hypercapnic ventilatory responses and reduced ventilatory recruitment threshold, and increased oxygen saturation and blood pressures, whereas increases in heart rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity were not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> significantly decreased after IH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No such changes were observed during the placebo day, except an increase in oxygen saturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Some of the effects lasted 3 h after IH, and some even persisted until 6 h after IH.CONCLUSIONSA single bout of IH induced an initial adaptation to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>, with improvement in cardiorespiratory reflexes and reduction in blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> could potentially benefit from the application of a full (&gt;2 weeks) IH intervention </plain></SENT>
