<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the mid-1990s, researchers began to re-examine type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from a more 'lipocentric' perspective; giving strong consideration to the idea that systemic <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> imbalances give rise to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> dysregulation, rather than vice versa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At the forefront of this paradigm shift was a report by Krssak and colleagues (Diabetologia 1999; 42:113-116) showing that intramyocellular <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> content, measured via the (then) novel application of proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, served as a robust indicator of muscle insulin sensitivity in healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A subsequent wave of investigations produced compelling correlative evidence linking ectopic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_42'>lipid deposition</z:mpath> within skeletal myocytes to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>But this relationship has proven much more complex than originally imagined, and scientists today are still left wondering if and how the intramyocellular accumulation of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> droplets has a direct bearing on insulin action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Originally viewed as a simple storage depot, the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> droplet is now recognised as an essential and sophisticated organelle that actively participates in numerous cellular processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This edition of 'Then and now' revisits the connection between intramuscular <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and looks to future research aimed at understanding the dynamic interplay between <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> droplet biology and metabolic health </plain></SENT>
