<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The current study sought to determine whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> infusion of the NO donor, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi> (SNP), increases leg <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake at rest in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifteen male patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (aged 54+/-4 years, mean+/-SD) were entered into a randomised, cross-over design study, examining the effect of a 30-min intra-femoral infusion of SNP on leg <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Comparison was made with a 30-min infusion of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi>, titrated to elicit similar leg blood flow responses to SNP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Leg blood flow was measured by thermodilution in the femoral vein, and leg <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake was calculated as the product of leg blood flow and the femoral arterio-venous (A-V) <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration gradient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The two drugs increased leg blood flow to a similar extent (p=0.50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both leg A-V <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration gradient (SNP 0.12+/-0.05, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> -0.06+/-0.04 mmol/l; mean+/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>, p=0.03) and leg <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake (SNP 0.17+/-0.09, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> -0.09+/-0.06 mmol/min; p=0.03) were higher with the SNP treatment than with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results occurred independently of any significant difference in plasma insulin concentration between drugs (p=0.56) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> infusion of SNP resulted in greater <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake relative to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>NO may therefore be an important mediator of peripheral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal and a potential therapeutic target in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
