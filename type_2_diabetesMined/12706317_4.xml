<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo> was estimated using HOMA(IR), basal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> and I(0)/G(0) ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Insulin secretion was estimated by means of HOMA(beta-cell), DeltaI(30-0)/DeltaG(30-0) ratio and the insulin concentration at 30 min post-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> load (I(30)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Disposition index (DI) was calculated to verify if insulin secretion compensate IR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> in males produced an increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the parameters indicative of IR in both groups of individuals, with (FH(+)) or without (FH(-)) family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, increase that was more pronounced in those FH(-) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This effect was not observed in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The parameters indicative of insulin secretion showed that only in males the presence of FH(+) was responsible for a significant decrease in insulin secretion, mainly expressed as lower values of HOMA(beta-cell) in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> as well as in non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The I(30) and the ratio DeltaI(30-0)/DeltaG(30-0), although lower, did not reach statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The DI showed that only when <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and FH were associated the decrease in insulin secretion was not a compensatory response to the IR present in those individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, normoglycemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> male subjects of Hispanic (Latinos) origin with a family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> present not only IR but <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948379" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">impaired insulin secretion</z:e>, having the <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> FH(+) and additional risk like low DI </plain></SENT>
