<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In animals, the adipocyte-derived hormone adiponectin has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity, a key factor in the pathogenesis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In Pima Indians, high plasma adiponectin levels are associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002891'>increased insulin sensitivity</z:mp> and reduced risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is unclear whether this is also the case in white individuals and whether an additional beneficial effect on <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism exists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We therefore analyzed in nondiabetic individuals the associations between plasma adiponectin concentrations and insulin sensitivity measured by a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp (n = 262) and estimated by an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT; n = 636) and serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> parameters using correlational analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma adiponectin concentrations were positively correlated with insulin sensitivity, both measured with the clamp (r = 0.28, P = 0.0015 in women; r = 0.42, P &lt; 0.0001 in men) and estimated from the OGTT (r = 0.37, P &lt; 0.0001 in women; r = 0.41, P &lt; 0.0001 in men) before and after adjusting for sex and percentage of body fat (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fasting <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> and the free fatty acid (FFA) concentrations during the OGTT (area under the curve) and at 120 min were negatively correlated in both women and men, whereas <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> was positively correlated with plasma adiponectin concentrations (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most notable, these relationships remained significant after adjusting for insulin sensitivity of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal in addition to sex and percentage of body fat (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, high adiponectin predicts <z:mp ids='MP_0002891'>increased insulin sensitivity</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This relationship is independent of low body fat mass and affects not only insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal but also <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> metabolism and insulin-mediated suppression of postprandial FFA release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This suggests pleiotropic insulin sensitizing effects of adiponectin in humans </plain></SENT>
