<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are known to have an increased risk for fracture compared with non-type 2 diabetic control subjects, despite having higher bone mineral density (BMD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously showed that serum pentosidine, one of the advanced glycation end products (AGEs), was associated with prevalent vertebral fractures (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VFs</z:e>) in those with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The involvement of the endogenous secretory receptor for AGEs (esRAGE) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VFs</z:e> in those with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, however, is still unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We compared parameters including esRAGE, pentosidine, and BMD in Japanese type 2 diabetic patients (137 men &gt;50 years old and 140 postmenopausal women) with and without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VFs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The esRAGE-to-pentosidine ratio in type 2 diabetic patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VFs</z:e> was significantly lower than in those without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VFs</z:e> (men: 7.1 +/- 2.8 vs. 9.4 +/- 6.2, P = 0.013, respectively; women: 4.7 +/- 2.7 vs. 8.2 +/- 5.4, P &lt; 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, BMI, A1C, serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, therapeutic agents, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> complications, osteoporotic risk factors, and lumbar BMD identified the serum esRAGE level and esRAGE-to-pentosidine ratio as factors associated with the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VFs</z:e>, independent of BMD in men (odds ratio [OR] 0.46 [95% CI 0.25-0.84], P = 0.012; and OR 0.34 [0.15-0.76], P = 0.009, respectively) and in women (OR 0.32 [0.16-0.67], P = 0.002; and OR 0.14 [0.04-0.43], P = 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results show that serum esRAGE level and esRAGE-to-pentosidine ratio are more useful than BMD for assessing the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VFs</z:e> in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
