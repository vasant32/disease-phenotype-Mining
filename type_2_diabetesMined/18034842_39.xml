<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This 24-week, multicentre, double-blind, randomized, active-controlled study compared vildagliptin (100 mg daily, given as equally divided doses, n = 295) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (30 mg daily, given as a single q.d. dose, n = 281) in patients with inadequate glycaemic control (A1C 7.5-11%) while receiving a stable <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> dose (&gt; or =1500 mg daily) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The adjusted mean changes from baseline to study endpoint (AMDelta) in A1C, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG), fasting <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and body weight were compared by analysis of covariance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: When added to a stable dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (mean dose at baseline &gt;2000 mg/day), both vildagliptin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> decreased A1C (AMDelta = -0.9 +/- 0.1% and -1.0 +/- 0.1%, respectively) from identical baseline values (8.4 +/- 0.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The between-group difference in AMDelta A1C was 0.1 +/- 0.1%, and non-inferiority of vildagliptin to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> was established at both 0.4 and 0.3% margins for upper limit of the 95% confidence intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">Pioglitazone</z:chebi> decreased FPG (AMDelta = -2.1 +/- 0.1 mmol/l) to a greater extent than vildagliptin (AMDelta = -1.4 +/- 0.1 mmol/l), but only <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0004324'>increased body weight</z:hpo> (AMDelta = +1.9 +/- 0.2 kg: between-group difference = -1.6 +/- 0.3 kg, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adverse events (AEs) were reported by 60% of vildagliptin-treated patients and by 56.4% of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>-treated patients; serious AEs were reported by 2.0 and 4.6% of patients receiving vildagliptin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> was reported by one patient (0.3%) in the vildagliptin group and by no patients receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: When added to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, the efficacy of vildagliptin is non-inferior to that of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The treatments were similarly well tolerated, but only <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0004324'>increased body weight</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
