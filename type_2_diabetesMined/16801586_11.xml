<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A pseudo-experimental cohort design was used to compare changes in risk factors from an intervention and a control district with similar socioeconomic status in Oslo, Norway, using a baseline investigation of 2,950 30- to 67-year-old participants and a follow-up investigation of 1,776 (67% of those eligible, 56% women, 18% non-Western immigrants) participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A set of theory-based activities to promote physical activity were implemented and tailored toward groups with different psychosocial readiness for change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> results reported are net changes (the difference between changes in the intervention and control districts) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At both surveys, the nonfasting serum levels of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> were adjusted for time since last meal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The increase in physical activity measured by two self-reported questionnaires was 9.5% (P = 0.008) and 8.1% (P = 0.02), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proportion who increased their body mass was 14.2% lower in the intervention district (P &lt; 0.001), implying a 50% relative reduction compared with the control district, and was lower across subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Beneficial effects were seen for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels (0.16 mmol/l [95% CI 0.06-0.25], P = 0.002), cholesterol-to-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> ratio (0.12 [0.03-0.20], P = 0.007), systolic blood pressure (3.6 mmHg [2.2-4.8], P &lt; 0.001), and for men also in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels (0.35 mmol/l [0.03-0.67], P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The net proportion who were quitting smoking was 2.9% (0.1-5.7, P = 0.043) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Through a theory-driven, low-cost, population-based intervention program, we observed an increase in physical activity levels, <z:mp ids='MP_0001262'>reduced weight</z:mp> gain, and beneficial changes in other risk factors for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
