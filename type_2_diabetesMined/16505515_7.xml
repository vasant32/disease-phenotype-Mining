<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: An observational cohort study of 526 Hispanic women with prior <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> who were not diabetic in their postpartum visit during January 1987 to October 1997 and who elected DMPA (n = 96) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28887">COCs</z:chebi> (n = 430) as initial contraception were followed for a maximum of 9.2 years with a median follow-up of approximately 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests were performed and choice of contraception method was recorded at each visit as part of routine clinical care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Annual <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence rates were 19% in the DMPA group and 12% in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28887">COC</z:chebi> group, with an unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.58 (95% CI 1.00-2.50; P = 0.05) for DMPA compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28887">COCs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adjustment for baseline imbalances reduced the HR to 1.18 (0.67-2.28; P = 0.57) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additional adjustment for <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> during follow-up, which was on average 1.8 kg higher in the DMPA group (P &lt; 0.0001), reduced the HR to 1.07 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DMPA interacted with baseline serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels and, separately, with breast-feeding to increase the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: DMPA use was associated with an increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> that appeared to be explained by three factors: 1) use in women with increased baseline <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk, 2) <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> during use, and 3) use with high baseline <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> and/or during breast-feeding </plain></SENT>
