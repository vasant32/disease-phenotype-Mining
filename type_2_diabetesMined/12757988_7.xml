<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare glycaemic control and cardiovascular risk profile in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> following 12 months' treatment with either repaglinide or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This was an open uncontrolled randomised study in n=112 patients with inadequately controlled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> not previously treated with oral hypoglycaemic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients beginning treatment with either repaglinide or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> entered an 8-week titration period (to optimise dosage: repaglinide, 2-4 mg/day; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, 1500-2500 mg/day) followed by a 12-month treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Glycaemic control and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> were determined at baseline and at the end of the treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean (S.D.) final drug doses were 3 (+/-1) mg/day in the repaglinide group and 2000 (+/-500) mg/day in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significant improvements in glycaemic control [glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi>, fasting and 2-h postprandial plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi>)] were demonstrated in both treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The decrease in <z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi> was significantly greater in the repaglinide group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During the treatment period, fasting plasma insulin (FPI) decreased significantly in both groups, more so with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two-hour postprandial plasma insulin (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi>) levels decreased only in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significant improvements between baseline and final visit were demonstrated in one or both groups in the following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>: total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, plasminogen activator inhibitor, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>(a) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No changes were observed in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> A-I, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B, fibrinogen, body mass index (BMI) or blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The use of repaglinide or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> in drug therapy-nai;ve patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> over a 12-month period is associated with improvements in both glycaemic control and cardiovascular risk profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The latter cannot necessarily be attributed to the pharmacotherapy per se, but provides reassurance in the context of initiating oral hypoglycaemic drug therapy with these agents </plain></SENT>
