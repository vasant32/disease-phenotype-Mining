<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Genetic studies have shown that mutations in the gene encoding hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-4alpha, a member of the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor superfamily, give rise to early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (MODY1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The functional properties of mutant HNF-4alpha proteins and the molecular mechanisms by which they impair insulin secretion are largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we have investigated transcriptional activation, DNA binding properties, and protein dimerization activity of three HNF-4alpha missense mutations--HNF4(R127W), HNF4(V255M), and HNF4(E276Q)--that have been associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that HNF4(E276Q) has lost its ability to bind to HNF-4 consensus binding sites and activate transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HNF4(E276Q) had no effect on the functional activity of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> HNF-4alpha in the pancreatic beta-cell line HIT-T15, but it exhibited weak dominant-negative activity in other cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of HNF4(E276Q) protein showed that it exists in two forms: a full length 54-kDa protein and a 40-kDa COOH-terminal protein lacking the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29318,29339">NH2</z:chebi>-terminal transactivation domain and the DNA binding domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that this truncated protein can bind to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> HNF-4alpha and may be responsible for the weak dominant-negative effects seen in these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, we show that the transcriptional transactivation of HNF4(R127W) and HNF4(V255M) is indistinguishable from that of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> HNF-4alpha, suggesting that they are sequence polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that HNF4(E276Q) is a loss-of-function mutation and that it identifies glutamic acid 276 in alpha-helix 8 of the ligand-binding domain of HNF-4alpha protein as a critical residue for DNA binding, transcriptional activation, and protein stability in vivo </plain></SENT>
