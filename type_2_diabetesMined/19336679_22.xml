<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 12 normoglycemic individuals, reduced-function variants in SLC22A1 were shown to decrease the ability of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> to reduce <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excursion in response to oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed the effect of two common loss-of-function polymorphisms in SLC22A1 on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> response in a large cohort of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Audit and Research in Tayside Scotland (DARTS) database includes prescribing and biochemistry information and clinical phenotypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> within Tayside, Scotland, from 1992 onwards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>R61C and 420del variants of SLC22A1 were genotyped in 3,450 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were incident users of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We assessed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> response by modeling the maximum A1C reduction in 18 months after starting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and investigated whether a treatment target of A1C &lt;7% was achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sustained <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> effect on A1C between 6 and 42 months was also assessed, as was the time to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Covariates were SLC22A1 genotype, BMI, average drug dose, adherence, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 1,531 patients were identified with a definable <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>R61C and 420del variants did not affect the initial A1C reduction (P = 0.47 and P = 0.92, respectively), the chance of achieving a treatment target (P = 0.83 and P = 0.36), the average A1C on monotherapy up to 42 months (P = 0.44 and P = 0.75), or the hazard of monotherapy failure (P = 0.85 and P = 0.56) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The SLC22A1 loss-of-function variants, R61C and 420del, do not attenuate the A1C reduction achieved by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
