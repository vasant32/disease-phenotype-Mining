<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study compared association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in FABP1-5 with T2DM in different ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Associations with T2DM of SNPs in these proteins were assessed in African American (AA), non-Hispanic White (NHW), and Hispanic American (HA) individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 650 DNA samples were genotyped; control samples were obtained from Coriell's North American Human Variation Panel Repository (NAHVP) of apparently healthy individuals and T2DM cases were taken from the American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association GENNID Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rs454550 SNP of FABP5 showed a significant association with T2DM in NHW (OR: 9.03, 95% CI: 1.13-71.73, p=0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our analysis also identified a new FABP5 SNP (nSNP) that showed a significant association with T2DM in NHW (OR: 0.44, 95% CI: 0.19-0.99, p=0.045) and AA (OR: 0.17, 95% CI: 0.03-0.80, p=0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Ala54Thr FABP2 polymorphism was significantly associated with T2DM in HA individuals only (OR: 1.85, 95% CI: 1.05-3.27, p=0.032) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest a potential distinct role(s) of SNPs in FABP5 and FABP2 genes in T2DM in different populations </plain></SENT>
