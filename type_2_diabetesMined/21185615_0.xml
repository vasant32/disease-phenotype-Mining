<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: This study recruited 896 patients undergoing elective CA for the evaluation of suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests (OGTTs) performed in patients without previously known <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> revealed that 173 (19.2%) had newly diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 281 (31.5%) had impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of abnormal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism (AGM) was significant difference among three groups of CA diagnosis, including <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> coronary, nonsignificant stenosis and CAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall, the proportion of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> increased from 22.0% at baseline to 41.2% post-OGTT analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In total, 270 (59.5%) patients with AGM would have remained undetected if OGTTs had not been performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with CAD, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and high C-reactive protein levels were at high risk of AGM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: AGM is common and underestimated by FPG testing alone in patients undergoing elective CA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>OGTTs should be routinely performed to assess the glucometabolic state of patients undergoing elective CA, especially in patients with high risks of AGM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Detecting the state of AGM in CA individuals may provide strategies to reduce the progression of AGM and associated complications </plain></SENT>
