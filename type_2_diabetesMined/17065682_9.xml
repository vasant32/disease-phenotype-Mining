<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the synergistic effects of SNPs have not been evaluated in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We measured the average <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> of the common and internal carotid artery in Japanese type 2 diabetic patients (n = 690) (&gt;50 years old) using ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also determined their genotypes regarding 106 SNPs in candidate genes responsible for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the 106 SNPs, we selected 40 common (frequency of minor allele &gt;/=10%) SNPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We compared the average <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> of subjects with and without any pairs of four genotypes selected from the 40 common SNPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The combination of methylen-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="20506,26907">tetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase 677 TT genotype and lymphotoxin-alpha (LTA) 252 GG genotype and that of ACE DD genotype and LTA 252 GG genotype were evaluated as responsible for a statistically significant (P = 2.7 x 10(-9) and 3.5 x 10(-6), respectively) increase in average <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> (mean [+/-SD] 1.54 +/- 0.60 and 1.43 +/- 0.58 mm, respectively) compared with those of the subjects without these combinations (1.04 +/- 0.34 and 1.04 +/- 0.34 mm, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No single genotype was shown to be responsible for the statistically significant difference in average <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> after Bonferroni's multiple comparison procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present analysis demonstrates an approach to evaluate combinations of multiple genetic risk factors that are synergistically associated with carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
