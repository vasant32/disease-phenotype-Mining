<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine whether the association between symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> varies across <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance status and between men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional data from a population-based cohort study in Hoorn, a medium-sized town in the Netherlands, were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study sample consisted of 541 men and women aged 55-75 years, of whom 260 had NGT, 164 had IGT and 117 had established type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Main outcome measures were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> defined by the homeostasis model assessment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-IR) and symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> using the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Scale (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e>-D) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the total sample, we found a weak positive correlation between the depressive symptoms <z:chebi fb="50" ids="3547">CED</z:chebi>-D scores and HOMA-IR scores (r (s) = 0.156, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Even weaker associations were found in subjects with NGT (r (s) = 0.041, p=0.509), in subjects with IGT (r (s) = 0.112, p = 0.160) and in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (r (s) = 0.007, p = 0.942) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The association between depressive symptoms and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> was similar for men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We found only weak associations between depressive symptoms and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, which did not differ among different <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism subgroups or between men and women </plain></SENT>
