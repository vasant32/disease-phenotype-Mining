<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a group of 443 unrelated Japanese patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we studied the B1B2 polymorphism at the CETP locus, which is detectable with the restriction enzyme TaqI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were separated into three groups according to genotype and compared based on their clinical characteristics, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> parameters, and macrovascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The B2 allele was associated in a dose-dependent fashion with higher <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> AI levels, together with lower CETP concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the prevalence of macrovascular complications, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> obliterans, and cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e>, was significantly higher in subjects with the B1B1 genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analysis also showed that the B1 allele of CETP genotype was associated with the incidence of these three complications independently of other risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, in type 2 diabetic patients, the B1B2 polymorphism of CETP gene is likely to be a strong genetic predictor of macrovascular complications </plain></SENT>
