<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The factors associated with incretin levels were also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A meal tolerance test (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>) was performed in eighteen poorly controlled (pDM) and fifteen well controlled (wDM) diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients in the pDM group underwent follow-up <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> after strict glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The secretions of intact glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (iGLP-1) and total <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent insulinotropic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (tGIP) during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> were calculated by total and incremental area under the curve (TAUC and IAUC) values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Posttreatment HbA1c level was significantly improved in the pDM group (11.2±0.9 to 7.9±0.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the secretion of incretin hormones was not increased in the posttreatment pDM group (TAUCiGLP-1, 3612±587 to 2916±405 pmol/L min; TAUCtGIP, 9417±1099 to 8338±903 pmol/L min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IAUCiGLP-1 was negatively correlated (r=-0.446, P=0.011) and independently associated (β=-137.2, P=0.027) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> assessed by homeostasis model assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Incretin secretion is not restored by short-term strict glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Decreased incretin secretion seems to develop early in the course of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with increasing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, but not to be influenced by glycaemic status </plain></SENT>
