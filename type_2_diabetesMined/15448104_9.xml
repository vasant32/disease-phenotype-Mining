<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the current pandemic is largely caused by societal environmental changes in diet, variation in response to these changes have, in part, a genetic basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we address the genetic basis for both <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>- and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related traits themselves and dietary fat responses for these traits in a set of recombinant inbred mouse strains formed from the cross of LG/J with SM/J (LGXSM lines) fed a standard low-fat (15% calories from fat) or high-fat (42% calories from fat) diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found substantial genetic variation for most of the traits studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Weight at time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, liver weight, and weight of the reproductive fat pad had especially high heritabilities, whereas heart weight and serum levels of free fatty acids and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> had low heritabilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genetic correlations were very high among fat pad weights and serum leptin, indicating shared genetic variation between fat levels and hormonal appetite control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> traits were moderately correlated with adult growth, liver weight, and serum insulin and cholesterol levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A majority of traits also displayed genetic variation in response to a high-fat diet, especially the weight of the reproductive and renal fat pads as well as the liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Genetic correlations in dietary response followed a pattern similar to that found for the traits themselves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Several strains manifested discordant responses for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and insulin, consistent with the presence of genotypes protective for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These recombinant inbred strains represent potentially valuable new models for dissecting the complex physiological relationships among <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
