<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Genome scans in families with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> identified a putative locus on chromosome 20q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For this study, linkage disequilibrium mapping was used in an effort to narrow a 7.3-Mb region in an Ashkenazi type 2 diabetic population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The region encompassed a 1-logarithm of odds (LOD) interval around the microsatellite marker D20S107, which gave a LOD score of &gt;3 in linkage analysis of a combined Caucasian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This 7.3-Mb region contained 25 known and 99 predicted genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Predicted single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were chosen from public databases and validated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two SNPs were unique to the Ashkenazi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Here, 91 SNPs with a minor allele frequency of &gt;or=10% were genotyped in pooled DNA from 150 case subjects and 150 control subjects of Ashkenazi Jewish descent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The SNP association study showed that SNP rs2664537 in the TIX1 gene had a significant P value of 0.035, but the finding did not replicate in an additional case pool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, HNF4a and Mybl2 were screened for mutations and new polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No mutations were identified, and a new nonsynonymous SNP (R687C in exon 14 of Mybl2) was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The limits to this type of association study are discussed </plain></SENT>
