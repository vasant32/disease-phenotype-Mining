<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion after blood letting in patients who had high-ferritin type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and were randomized to blood letting (three phlebotomies [500 ml of blood] at 2-week intervals, group 1) or to observation (group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Insulin secretion and sensitivity were tested at baseline and 4 and 12 months thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The two groups were matched for age, BMI, pharmacologic treatment, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Baseline glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (6.27 +/- 0.9% vs. 6.39 +/- 1.2%), insulin sensitivity (2.75 +/- 1.8 vs. 3.2 +/- 2.1 mg.dl(-1).min(-1)), and area under the curve for C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (AUC(C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>); 38.7 +/- 11.6 vs. 37.6 +/- 14.1 ng.ml(-1).min(-1)) were not significantly different between the two groups of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Body weight, blood pressure, blood hematocrit levels, and drug treatment remained essentially unchanged during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As expected, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation index, and blood <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> decreased significantly at 4 months only in patients who received blood letting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In parallel to this changes, blood HbA(1c) decreased significantly only in group 1 subjects (mean differences, -0.61; 95% CI, -0.17 to -1.048; P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>AUC(C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>) decreased by -10.2 +/- 6.3% after blood letting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, a 10.4 +/- 6.4% increase in AUC(C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>) was noted in group 2 subjects at 4 months (P = 0.032) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At 12 months, AUC(C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>) returned to values not significantly different from baseline in the two groups of subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>At 4 months, the change in insulin sensitivity from baseline was significantly different between the two groups (80.6 +/- 43.2% vs. -8.6 +/- 9.9% in groups 1 and 2, respectively, P = 0.049) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>At 12 months, the differences between the two groups were even more marked (55.5 +/- 24.8% vs. -26.8 +/- 9.9%; P = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>When the analysis was restricted to those subjects who completed the follow-up until 12 months, results did not show differences compared with the changes observed at 4 months, except for insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A statistically significant increase in insulin sensitivity was observed in the blood-letting group (from 2.30 +/- 1.81 to 3.08 +/- 2.55 mg.dl(-1).min(-1) at 4 months, to 3.16 +/- 1.85 mg.dl(-1).min(-1) at 12 months; P = 0,045) in contrast with group 2 subjects (from 3.24 +/- 1.9 to 3.26 +/- 2.05 mg.dl(-1).min(-1) at 4 months, to 2.31 +/- 1.35 mg.dl(-1).min(-1) at 12 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In summary, blood letting led simultaneously to decreased blood HbA(1c) levels and to changes in insulin secretion and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> that were significantly different from those observed in a matched observational group of subjects with high-ferritin type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms for improvement in peripheral insulin sensitivity after blood letting should be investigated further </plain></SENT>
