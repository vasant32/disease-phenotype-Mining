<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether traits of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> personality are associated with variations in glycemic control in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A longitudinal cohort study was conducted using data from 105 type 2 diabetic patients in a clinical trial of a stress management intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Before treatment assignment, patients completed the NEO Personality Inventory, Revised, which is a questionnaire inventory measuring 5 major domains of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> personality and 30 important traits that define these domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Glycemic control was assessed by measures of HbA1c and average blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels based on 7 days of self-monitoring at baseline and at 6 and 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Relationships between personality traits and measures of glycemic control were examined by correlation and linear regression models that were adjusted for age, sex, race, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, medication status, and experimental treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Lower average blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> values at baseline were associated with higher scores for the personality domain of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027932" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">neuroticism</z:e> and several specific traits including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, angry hostility <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, self-consciousness, and vulnerability but were associated with lower scores for the trait of altruism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results were similar for HbA1c but were not as strong </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Follow-up results were similar but were less consistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Personality traits may offer new insights into variations in glycemic control in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> undergoing standard management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The relative tendency to experience fewer negative emotions and to focus on the needs of others instead of oneself could prove to be a risk factor for poor glycemic control </plain></SENT>
