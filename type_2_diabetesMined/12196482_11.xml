<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Isoforms that are expressed in the red cell, liver, pancreatic beta-cells, small intestine, and proximal renal tubule are encoded by the 12 exons of the PKLR gene, which maps to chromosome 1q23 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that common variants of the PKLR gene could account for the linkage of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> to this region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We screened the promoter regions, exons and surrounding introns, and the 3' untranslated region for mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We identified five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and only one (V506I, exon 11) altered the coding sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We tested the five SNPs, a poly-T insertion-deletion polymorphism, and an ATT triplet repeat in 131 unrelated diabetic patients and 118 nondiabetic control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The V506I variant was rare and not associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The four SNPs and the insertion-deletion polymorphism were associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, with a 10% difference between individuals with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and nondiabetic individuals (P = 0.001-0.011, relative risk for minor allele 1.85) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The same trend was found for the ATT repeat (P = 0.029) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Common variants in the PKLR are associated with increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but because of strong linkage disequilibrium between variants, the actual susceptibility allele may be in a different gene </plain></SENT>
