<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, recent evidence implicates a role for p38 MAPK in the regulation of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transport; a site of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus we determined p38 MAPK protein expression and phosphorylation in skeletal muscle from Type 2 diabetic patients and non-diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In vitro effects of insulin (120 nmol/l) or AICAR (1 mmol/l) on p38 MAPK expression and phosphorylation were determined in skeletal muscle from non-diabetic (n=6) and Type 2 diabetic (n=9) subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: p38 MAPK protein expression was similar between Type 2 diabetic patients and non-diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Insulin exposure increased p38 MAPK phosphorylation in non-diabetic, but not in Type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, basal phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was increased in skeletal muscle from Type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: Insulin increases p38 MAPK phosphorylation in skeletal muscle from non-diabetic subjects, but not in Type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, basal p38 MAPK phosphorylation is increased in skeletal muscle from Type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, aberrant p38 MAPK signalling might contribute to the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
