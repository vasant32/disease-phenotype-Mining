<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to reveal a significant association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pre-diabetic</z:e> phenotypes in nondiabetic individuals based on a systematic meta-analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> available published evidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed a classical meta-analysis of data from approximately 32,000 nondiabetic subjects in 57 studies to assess the effect of the Pro12Ala polymorphism on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pre-diabetic</z:e> traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the global comparison, there were no differences in BMI, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, or homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> between the Pro/Pro and X/Ala genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, in the Caucasian subgroup, the X/Ala genotype was associated with significantly <z:mp ids='MP_0006087'>increased BMI</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subgroup (BMI &gt;30 kg/m(2)), fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (P = 0.041) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (by homeostasis model analysis) (P = 0.020) were significantly greater in the Pro/Pro group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In subjects with the homozygous Ala/Ala genotype, fasting insulin was significantly lower compared with the Pro/Pro genotype (P = 0.040, N(Ala/Ala) = 154) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studies, the Pro12Ala polymorphism had no significant effect on <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only in selected subgroups, such as Caucasians and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects, did we see an association of the Ala allele with greater BMI and greater insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This demonstrates the importance for appropriate stratification of analyses by environmental or other genetic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Meta-analysis of Ala/Ala homozygotes more clearly demonstrated the association with greater insulin sensitivity of carriers of the Ala allele </plain></SENT>
