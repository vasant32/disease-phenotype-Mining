<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to identify food intake patterns influencing this pathway and evaluate their association with incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin Resistance</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Study cohort included 880 middle-aged adults initially free of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the 5-year follow-up, 144 individuals had developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Usual dietary intake was ascertained with a 114-item food frequency questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using reduced rank regression, we identified a food pattern maximizing the explained variation in PAI-1 and fibrinogen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, the food pattern-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> association was evaluated using logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: High intake of the food groups red meat, low-fiber bread and cereal, dried beans, fried potatoes, tomato vegetables, eggs, cheese, and cottage cheese and low intake of wine characterized the pattern, which was positively associated with both biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With increasing pattern score, the odds of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> increased significantly (Ptrend &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After multivariate adjustment, the odds ratio comparing extreme quartiles was 4.3 (95% CI 1.7-10.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Adjustment for insulin sensitivity and secretion and other metabolic factors had little impact (4.9, 1.8-13.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide support for potential behavioral prevention strategies, as we identified a food intake pattern that was strongly related to PAI-1 and fibrinogen and independently predicted type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
