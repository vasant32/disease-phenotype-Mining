<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Study of Once Daily Levemir was a 24-week international observational study involving 10 countries which evaluated the safety and effectiveness of initiating once-daily insulin detemir in people with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) being treated with one or more OADs (clinical trial number NCT00825643 and NCT00740519) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 17 374 participants were enrolled in the study: aged 62 ± 12 years, 53% male, T2DM duration 10 ± 7 years, body mass index 29.3 ± 5.4 kg/m(2)  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pre-insulin HbA1c was 8.9 ± 1.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proportion of patients with HbA1c ≥9.0% ranged from 64% (UK) to 23% (Poland) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pre-insulin OAD treatment included <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (81%), sulphonylureas (59%), glinides (16%), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> (TZD) (12%), α-glucosidase inhibitors (12%) and dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-IV inhibitors (7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean starting dose of insulin detemir for the total cohort was 0.16 ± 0.09 U/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Differences in OAD use and insulin doses at initiation were evident among participating countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The largest proportional changes in OAD prescribing at insulin initiation were seen with glinides (+15%), sulphonylureas (-19%), TZD (-31%) and DPP-IV inhibitors (-28%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite well-documented benefits of timely glycaemic control and consensus guidelines encouraging earlier use of insulin, considerable clinical inertia exists with respect to initiating appropriate insulin therapy in people with T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Considerable regional differences exist in the timing of insulin initiation and in the use of OADs </plain></SENT>
