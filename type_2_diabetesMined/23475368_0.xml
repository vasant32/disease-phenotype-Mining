<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since erythropoietin-producing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019204" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatoma</z:e> (Eph)-ephrin bidirectional signalling fine-tunes GSIS from pancreatic beta cells, we investigated Eph receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) as potential drug targets for selectively increasing GSIS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Insulin secretion assays were carried out using mouse and human pancreatic islets as well as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1522248" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">mouse insulinoma</z:e> (MIN6) cells in the presence or absence of two Eph RTK inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the most potent inhibitor was injected into mice to evaluate its effects on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance and plasma insulin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We showed that the Eph RTK inhibitors selectively increased GSIS from MIN6 cells as well as mouse and human islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results also showed that the insulin secretory effects of these compounds required Eph-ephrin signalling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, pharmacological inhibition of Eph receptor signalling <z:mp ids='MP_0005292'>improved glucose tolerance</z:mp> in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We showed for the first time that Eph RTKs represent targets for small molecules to selectively increase GSIS and improve <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
