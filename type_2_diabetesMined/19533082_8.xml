<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the context of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal disease</z:e>, PPARgamma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> reduce <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> in diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>; however, the mechanisms underlying this effect are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Glomerular podocytes are newly characterised insulin-sensitive cells and there is good evidence that they are targeted in diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study we investigated the functional and molecular effects of the PPARgamma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> on human podocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Conditionally immortalised human podocytes were cultured with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> and functional effects were measured with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-uptake assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake was also measured in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, nephrin-deficient podocytes, human glomerular endothelial cells, proximal tubular cells and podocytes treated with the NEFA <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The role of the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transporter GLUT1 was investigated with immunofluorescence and small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> knockdown and the plasma membrane expression of GLUT1 was determined with bis-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi> photolabelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">Rosiglitazone</z:chebi> significantly increased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> podocytes and this was associated with translocation of GLUT1 to the plasma membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This effect was blocked with GLUT1 small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nephrin-deficient podocytes, glomerular endothelial cells and proximal tubular cells did not increase <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake in response to either insulin or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> significantly increased basal and insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake when podocytes were treated with the NEFA <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In conclusion, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> has a direct and protective effect on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> human podocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This represents a novel mechanism by which PPARgamma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> may improve podocyte function in diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
