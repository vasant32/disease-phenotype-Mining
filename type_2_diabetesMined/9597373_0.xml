<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study has investigated the effect of metabolic intervention on the progression in UAER in relation to initial UAER levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 20 patients with type-2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and secondary failure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> were observed during 1 year (age, 60 +/- 8 years; HbA1c, 10.8 +/- 1.4%; and duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 17 +/- 10 years) and divided into two groups: group 1 (n = 10; UAER: 51 +/- 35 mg/24 h); and group 2 (n = 10; UAER: 191 +/- 175 mg/24 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite a significant improvement of metabolic control by insulin treatment in both groups (HbA1c: group 1: 11 +/- 1.5 vs. 7.9 +/- 1.2%; group 2: 10.6 +/- 0.9 vs. 9.1 +/- 1.3%, P &lt; 0.001), a progression of UAER was observed in group 2 (191 +/- 175 vs. 331 +/- 237 mg/24 h, P &lt; 0.02), but not in group 1 (51 +/- 35 vs. 41 +/- 24 mg/24 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Still serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> levels remained <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients during the observation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 24 h blood pressure (RR) values in the two groups remained <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> under <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> therapy throughout the study (group 1: RR syst: 130 vs. 136 mmHg; RR diast: 80 vs. 81 mmHg, mean arterial pressure (MAD): 89 vs. 93 mmHg; group 2: RR syst: 139 vs. 134 mmHg; RR diast: 78 vs. 75 mmHg, MAD: 97 vs. 90 mmHg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The data shows that in type-2 diabetic patients with normotensive blood pressure values the initial urinary albumin excretion levels determine the progression of UAER </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When metabolic control is improved incipient UAER remains constant, but advanced UAER shows progression </plain></SENT>
