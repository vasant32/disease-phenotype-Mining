<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Toxic oligomers of IAPP form intracellularly in β-cells in humans with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, suggesting impaired clearance of misfolded proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated whether human-IAPP (h-IAPP) disrupts the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation/ubiquitin/proteasome system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used pancreatic tissue from humans with and without type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, isolated islets from h-IAPP transgenic rats, isolated human islets, and INS 832/13 cells transduced with adenoviruses expressing either h-IAPP or a comparable expression of rodent-IAPP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence and Western blotting were used to detect polyubiquitinated proteins and ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1) protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Proteasome activity was measured in isolated rat and human islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>UCH-L1 was knocked down by small-interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> in INS 832/13 cells and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We report accumulation of polyubiquinated proteins and UCH-L1 deficiency in β-cells of humans with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings were reproduced by expression of oligomeric h-IAPP but not soluble rat-IAPP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Downregulation of UCH-L1 expression and activity to reproduce that caused by h-IAPP in β-cells induced endoplasmic reticulum stress leading to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that defective protein degradation in β-cells in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> can, at least in part, be attributed to misfolded h-IAPP leading to UCH-L1 deficiency, which in turn further compromises β-cell viability </plain></SENT>
