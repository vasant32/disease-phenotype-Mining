<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To develop efficient novel biomarkers associated with the pathogenesis of DN, we investigated urinary megalin excretion in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay systems were established with monoclonal antibodies against the NH(2) (amino [A]-megalin assay) and COOH (C-megalin assay) termini of megalin to analyze urinary forms of megalin in 68 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The A-megalin assay mainly detected a megalin ectodomain form in the soluble urinary fraction, whereas the C-megalin assay identified a full-length form in both soluble and insoluble fractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Urinary C-megalin levels were significantly high in patients with normoalbuminuria, were elevated in line with increased <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp>, and showed a better association with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (&lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) than did urinary albumin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, urinary A-megalin levels were increased in patients with normo- and <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> but not in those with macroalbuminuria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Urinary C-megalin levels were also positively associated with plasma inorganic phosphate and negatively with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels in those showing no features of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and not taking <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> analogs, phosphate binders, or erythropoiesis-stimulating agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Urinary full-length megalin excretion as measured by the C-megalin assay is well associated with reduced eGFR and linked to the severity of DN, phosphate dysregulation, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, whereas urinary excretion of megalin ectodomain as measured by the A-megalin assay may be associated with distinctive mechanisms of earlier DN in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
