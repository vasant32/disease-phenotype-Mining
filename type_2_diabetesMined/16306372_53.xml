<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To understand the complex series of events that occur during the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we examined the temporal pattern of changes in insulin action and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in individual organs during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> high-fat feeding in C57BL/6 mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Insulin-stimulated cardiac <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism was significantly reduced after 1.5 weeks of high-fat feeding, and cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> was associated with blunted Akt-mediated insulin signaling and GLUT4 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo> in skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, and liver developed in parallel after 3 weeks of high-fat feeding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diet-induced whole-body <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> was associated with increased circulating levels of resistin and leptin but unaltered adiponectin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High-fat feeding caused <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in skeletal muscle that was associated with significantly elevated intramuscular fat content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, diet-induced hepatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> developed before a marked increase in intrahepatic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cardiac function gradually declined over the course of high-fat feeding, and after 20 weeks of high-fat diet, cardiac dysfunction was associated with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, hyperleptinemia, and reduced circulating adiponectin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings demonstrate that cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> is an early adaptive event in response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and develops before changes in whole-body <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This suggests that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-associated defects in cardiac function may not be due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> per se but may be attributable to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> alteration in cardiac <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism and circulating adipokines </plain></SENT>
