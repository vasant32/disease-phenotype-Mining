<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This multicenter study was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of this drug with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi> in a 1-year randomized double-blind study of outpatients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 424 subjects (154 women, 270 men) participated and had the following characteristics: age, 61 +/- 9 years; duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>8 years (range 0.5-35); BMI, 28.3 +/- 3.5 kg/m2; HbA1c, 7.1 +/- 1.4%; and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, 10.8 +/- 3.1 mmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The majority of the subjects (91%) were previously treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi>, alone or in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients were randomized to a 2:1 ratio of repaglinide (0.5-4 mg t.i.d.) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi> (1.75-10.5 mg daily) treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The study protocol included a screening visit to assess patient eligibility; a titration period of 6-8 weeks, during which the dosages of repaglinide and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi> were optimized; and a subsequent 12-month treatment period on fixed, optimal dosages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The trial was completed by 320 subjects, 211 (74%) in the repaglinide and 109 (78%) in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HbA1c initially decreased in both groups and then increased during the second half-year of the maintenance period to a similar extent in the repaglinide and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi> subjects (0.58 and 0.45% vs. at screening, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the small group of subjects who previously controlled their condition with diet only (n = 37), a sustained improvement of metabolic control could be observed with both drugs, which was slightly better with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi> than with repaglinide (theta HbA1c -2.4 vs. -1.0%; P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The same trends were seen with fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no changes in serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Over the course of the study, 15% of the repaglinide-treated and 13% of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi>-treated subjects withdrew due to adverse events, mostly <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No differences in adverse events between both drugs were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in incidences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Repaglinide is a safe and efficacious oral blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering agent, with a potency similar to that of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Its rapid <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of action and hepatic clearance allows meal-related administration, including in subjects with impaired kidney function </plain></SENT>
