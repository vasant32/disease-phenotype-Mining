<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of a lifestyle intervention program that can be readily translated into clinical practice for <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study consisted of a 12-month randomized controlled trial of 147 health plan members with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (BMI &gt;or=27 kg/m(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants were randomized to lifestyle case management or usual care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Case management entailed individual and group education, support, and referral by registered dietitians; intervention cost was US dollars 350 per person </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Individuals treated with usual care received educational material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both groups received ongoing primary care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Outcomes were difference between groups for change in weight (kilograms), waist circumference (centimeters), HbA(1c), fasting <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels, use of prescription medications, and health-related quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Case management resulted in greater <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.001), reduced waist circumference (P &lt; 0.001), reduced HbA(1c) level (P = 0.02), less use of prescription medications (P = 0.03), and improved health-related quality of life (P &lt; 0.001) compared with usual care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 12-month group difference in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and waist circumference was 3.0 kg (95% CI -5.4 to -0.6) and -4.2 cm (-6.8 to -1.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>HbA(1c) differences were greatest at 4 months (-0.59%, P = 0.006) but not significant by 12 months (-0.19%, P = 0.45) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Participants in the case management group lowered their use of medications, primarily <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> medications, by 0.8 medications per day more than participants treated with usual care (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In seven of nine quality-of-life domains, the case management group improved compared with usual care (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Moderate-cost dietitian-led lifestyle case management may improve diverse health indicators among <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
