<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Increasing the circulating levels of incretins through administration of DPP-IV inhibitors has therefore been introduced as a therapeutic approach for the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DPP-IV inhibitor treatment has also been shown to preserve islet mass in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519106" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">rodent models</z:e> of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The current study was initiated to define the effects of the DPP-IV inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">MK0431</z:chebi>) on transplanted islet survival in nonobese diabetic (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOD</z:e>) mice, an autoimmune type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">MK0431</z:chebi> on islet graft survival in diabetic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOD</z:e> mice were determined with metabolic studies and micropositron emission tomography imaging, and its underlying molecular mechanisms were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOD</z:e> mice with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">MK0431</z:chebi> before and after islet transplantation resulted in prolongation of islet graft survival, whereas treatment after transplantation alone resulted in small beneficial effects compared with nontreated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subsequent studies demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">MK0431</z:chebi> pretreatment resulted in decreased <z:mp ids='MP_0004031'>insulitis</z:mp> in diabetic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOD</z:e> mice and reduced in vitro migration of isolated splenic CD4+ T-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in vitro treatment of splenic CD4+ T-cells with DPP-IV resulted in increased migration and activation of protein kinase A (PKA) and Rac1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">MK0431</z:chebi> therefore reduced the effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> on graft survival partially by decreasing the homing of CD4+ T-cells into pancreatic beta-cells through a pathway involving cAMP/PKA/Rac1 activation </plain></SENT>
