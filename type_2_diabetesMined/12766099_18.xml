<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 20 free-living subjects who had type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and took hyperglycemic drugs as prescribed were enrolled in the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects consumed oolong tea (1,500 ml) or water for 30 days each in a randomized crossover design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tea was not consumed for 14 days prior to treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Relative to initial concentrations, oolong tea markedly lowered concentrations of plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (from 229 +/- 53.9 to 162.2 +/- 29.7 mg/dl, P &lt; 0.001) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24103">fructosamine</z:chebi> (from 409.9 +/- 96.1 to 323.3 +/- 56.4 micromol/l, P &lt; 0.01), whereas the water control group had not changed (208.7 +/- 61.0 vs. 232.3 +/- 63.1 mg/dl for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and from 368.4 +/- 85.0 to 340.0 +/- 76.1 micromol/l for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24103">fructosamine</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Oolong tea may be an effective adjunct to oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi> in the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
