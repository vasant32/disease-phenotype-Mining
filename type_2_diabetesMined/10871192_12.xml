<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The SOX (sex-determining region [SRY]-type high mobility group [HMG] box) family of transcription factors play key roles in determining cell fate during organ development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have identified a new human SOX gene, SOX13, as encoding the type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> autoantigen, islet cell antigen 12 (ICA12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis showed that SOX13 belongs to the class D subgroup of SOX transcription factors, which contain a leucine zipper motif and a region rich in glutamine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SOX13 autoantibodies occurred at a significantly higher frequency among 188 people with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (18%) than among 88 with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (6%) or 175 healthy control subjects (4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Deletion mapping of the antibody <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> showed that the autoantibodies were primarily directed against an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> requiring the majority of the protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SOX13 <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was detected in most human tissues, with the highest levels in the pancreas, placenta, and kidney </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry on sections of human pancreas identified SOX13 in the islets of Langerhans, where staining was mostly cytoplasmic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In mouse pancreas, Sox13 was present in the nucleus and cytoplasm of beta-cells as well as other islet cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recombinant SOX13 protein bound to the SOX consensus DNA motif AACAAT, and binding was inhibited by homodimer formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These observations-along with the known molecular interactions of the closely related protein, rainbow trout Sox23-suggest that SOX13 may be activated for nuclear import and DNA binding through heterodimer formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we have identified ICA12 as the putative transcription factor SOX13 and demonstrated an increased frequency of autoantibody reactivity in sera from type 1 diabetic subjects compared with type 2 diabetic and healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
