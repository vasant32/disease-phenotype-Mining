<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Because of increasing evidence that white blood cells (WBCs) play a role in the development and progression of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> complications, this study aimed to investigate the relation of circulating total and differential leukocyte counts to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Plasma leptin levels were also measured to investigate their role in peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001974'>leukocytosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: For this study, 1,480 subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were enrolled in a disease management program were stratified according to urinary microalbumin and serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The total and differential leukocyte profiles of peripheral blood were measured and plasma leptin was examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Demographic and potential metabolic confounding factors were analyzed with linear and logistic regression to calculate the effects of leukocyte count on diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The peripheral total WBC, monocyte, and neutrophil counts increased in parallel with the advancement of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the lymphocyte count decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When WBC counts were analyzed per quartile and as continuous variables after adjusting for age, sex, and other known risk factors with multiple regression analysis, peripheral total WBC, monocyte, neutrophil, and lymphocyte counts were independently and significantly associated with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Plasma leptin levels increased in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> and correlated significantly with total WBC count (r = 0.194, P = 0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Because leukocytes are activated and secrete cytokines in the diabetic state and leptin stimulates leukocyte proliferation and differentiation, our results suggest that circulating leukocytes contribute to the development and progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, partially through the effects of leptin, in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
