<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we determined whether SNPs in PTPN1 also have a role in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility in Pima Indians, a population with the world's highest reported prevalence and incidence rates of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-one SNPs across a 161-kb region encompassing PTPN1 were genotyped in 1,037 Pima Indians for association studies with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-five of the SNPs had allele frequencies &gt;0.05, and these SNPs fell into two linkage disequilibrium blocks (D' &gt; 0.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Block 1 contains six SNPs that span a 61-kb region upstream of PTPN1, while block 2 contains 19 SNPs that cover the entire PTPN1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of the SNPs, analysed individually or as haplotypes, was associated with either type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, three SNPs located in block 1 were nominally associated (p values ranging from 0.01 to 0.05) with insulin sensitivity as measured by the hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Based on our association results, we conclude that SNPs within PTPN1 are unlikely to have a major role in the aetiology of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in Pima Indians </plain></SENT>
