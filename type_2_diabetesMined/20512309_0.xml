<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore aimed to investigate the regulation of proximal insulin signalling in skeletal muscle and its effect on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in a large non-diabetic population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined 184 non-diabetic twins with gold-standard techniques including the euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Insulin signalling was evaluated at three key levels, i.e. the insulin receptor, IRS-1 and V-akt murine <z:hpo ids='HP_0100522'>thymoma</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> oncogene (Akt) levels, employing kinase assays and phospho-specific western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Proximal insulin signalling was not associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, age or sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, birthweight was positively associated with IRS-1-associated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16749">phosphoinositide</z:chebi> 3-kinase (PI3K; IRS-1-PI3K) activity (p = 0.04); maximal aerobic capacity (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="30047">VO2</z:chebi>(max)), paradoxically, was negatively associated with IRS-1-PI3K (p = 0.02) and Akt2 activity (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we found low heritability estimates for most measures of insulin signalling activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> disposal was positively associated with Akt-308 phosphorylation (p &lt; 0.001) and Akt2 activity (p = 0.05), but not with insulin receptor tyrosine kinase or IRS-1-PI3K activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: With the exception of birthweight, 'classical' modifiers of insulin action, including genetics, age, sex, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30047">VO2</z:chebi>(max) do not seem to mediate their most central effects on whole-body insulin sensitivity through modulation of proximal insulin signalling in skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We also demonstrated an association between Akt activity and in vivo insulin sensitivity, suggesting a role of Akt in control of in vivo <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and potentially in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
