<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Telephone survey of 1530 insulin-treated adults with self-reported <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (110 type 1 and 1420 type 2) in China, France, Japan, Germany, Spain, Turkey, UK or USA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants had a mean age of ∼60 years, ∼15 years duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and ∼9 years duration of insulin treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Regression analysis assessed the independent associations (p &lt; 0.05) of country, participant characteristics and treatment-related beliefs/perceptions with number of days in the past month that an insulin injection was missed or not taken as prescribed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One third (35%) of respondents reported one or more days (mean: ∼3 days) of insulin omission/non-adherence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Insulin omission/non-adherence differed widely across countries (range = 20-44%); differences in days of insulin omission/non-adherence were maintained after adjustment for other risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most risk factors had similar relationships with insulin omission/non-adherence across countries (few interactions with country) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Insulin omission/non-adherence was more frequent among respondents who were male, younger, had type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or more frequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e>, were less successful with other treatment tasks, regarded insulin adherence as less important, had more practical/logistical barriers and difficulties with insulin adherence, were concerned that insulin treatment required lifestyle changes or were dissatisfied with the flexibility of injection timing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of this large-scale study suggest that insulin omission/non-adherence is common and associated with several modifiable risk factors (including practical barriers, injection difficulties, lifestyle burden and regimen inflexibility) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additional efforts to address these risk factors might reduce the frequency of insulin omission/non-adherence and lead to improved clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
