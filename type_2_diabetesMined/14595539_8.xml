<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">Rosiglitazone</z:chebi> is used to treat Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> because it improves insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the specific molecular mechanism by which this compound acts has not yet been explained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used fetal rat primary brown adipocytes cultured for 24 h with or without 10 micro mol/l <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> and further stimulated for 5 min with 10 nmol/l insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Next we measured <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake and GLUT4 translocation and submitted the cells to lysis, immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting in order to measure the insulin signalling cascade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">Rosiglitazone</z:chebi> noticeably activated basal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake in a manner dependent on p38-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">Rosiglitazone</z:chebi> also produced a 40% increase in insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake as a result of increased GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This happened without changes in the expression of GLUT4 at the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> or protein level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This effect correlated with the potentiation by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> of insulin-stimulated Tyr phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 and to a greater extent of insulin receptor substrate-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It also correlated with the subsequent activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Akt, without changes in protein kinase Czeta activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">Rosiglitazone</z:chebi> treatment increased insulin receptor expression and insulin-stimulated Tyr phosphorylation of insulin receptor beta-chain, but decreased insulin-stimulated Ser phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It also potentiated insulin-induced Tyr phosphorylation of insulin receptor beta-chain and protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B in co-immunoprecipitates and impaired insulin activation of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: At the insulin receptor level, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>-induced improvements of insulin sensitivity result from two convergent mechanisms: increased insulin receptor expression and insulin receptor activation </plain></SENT>
