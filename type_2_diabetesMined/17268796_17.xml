<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we report on the development of prevalence and incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from 1972 to 2001 in Laxå, a rural community in central Sweden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> register was established at the primary healthcare centre (PHCC) in Laxå, beginning in 1972 and based on data from clinical records at the PHCC, nearby hospitals and private practitioners in the area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, case-finding procedures involving 85% of the residents aged 35 to 79 years old was performed from 1983 onwards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the study period a total of 776 new <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> cases was found, 36 type 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and 740 type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The age-standardised incidence rates for type 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> were 0.15 and 3.03 cases per 1,000 population, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No increase in incidence over time was detected for either forms of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> in Laxå is high, but has not increased during the last 13 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence rate was relatively stable over the whole 30-year period </plain></SENT>
