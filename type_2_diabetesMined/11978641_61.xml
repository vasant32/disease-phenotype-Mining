<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rat, a genetic model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the neonatal beta-cell mass deficit is considered to be the primary defect leading to basal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, which is detectable for the first time 3 weeks after birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated in GK females the short- and the long-term effects of a treatment with glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) or its long-acting analog exendin-4 (Ex-4) during the first postnatal week (during the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetic</z:e> period) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>GK rats were treated with daily injections of glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (400 microg x kg(-1) x day(-1)) or Ex-4 (3 microg x kg(-1) x day(-1)) from day 2 to day 6 after birth and were evaluated against Wistar and untreated GK rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Under these conditions, on day 7 both treatments enhanced pancreatic insulin content and total beta-cell mass by stimulating beta-cell neogenesis and regeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follow-up of biological characteristics from day 7 to adult age (2 months) showed that such a GLP-1 or Ex-4 treatment exerted long-term favorable influences on beta-cell mass and glycemic control at adult age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As compared to untreated GK rats, 2-month-old treated rats exhibited significantly decreased basal plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Their <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion, in vivo after intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> load or in vitro using isolated perfused pancreas, was slightly improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This contributed at least partly to improve the in vivo plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disappearance rate, which was found to be increased in both treated GK groups compared to the untreated GK group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings in the GK model indicated, for the first time, that GLP-1 or Ex-4 treatment limited to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetic</z:e> period delays the installation and limits the severity of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Under these conditions, GLP-1 represents a unique tool because of its beta-cell replenishing effect in spontaneously diabetic rodents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It may prove to be an invaluable agent for the prevention of human type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
