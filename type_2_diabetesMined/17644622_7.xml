<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we sought to determine the factors associated with exaggerated glucagon secretion in response to an arginine challenge in patients with type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Changes in circulating C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> immunoreactivity (CPR) and immunoreactive glucagon (IRG) after an arginine challenge were investigated in 35 patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 130 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and 35 nondiabetic control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No significant differences were found in the basal level and the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of IRG (AUC(IRG)) among type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients and nondiabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, there was an inverse correlation between the AUC(IRG) and the AUC of CPR (AUC(CPR)) for type 1 (r = -0.388, P = 0.023) and type 2 (r = 0.396, P &lt; 0.0001) diabetic patients, whereas AUC(IRG) was not correlated with AUC(CPR) in nondiabetic subjects (r = -0.079, P = 0.655) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In type 1 diabetic patients, the AUC(CPR) decreased and the AUC(IRG) increased with increasing disease duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In type 2 diabetic patients, both AUC(IRG) and AUC(CPR) increased with increasing BMI, basal CPR level, and homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the pathophysiology of the exaggerated glucagon response differs between type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intraislet insulin deficiency and alpha-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> may be the primary contributors to this condition in type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, respectively </plain></SENT>
