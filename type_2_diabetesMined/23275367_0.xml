<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The sample included 13,609 adults.RESULTSOn average, there was little change in BMI (-0.12, SD 3.07); 17.0 and 16.1% had clinically substantive BMI loss or gain, respectively, at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was a positive association between neighborhood deprivation and BMI change for adults in the most versus least-deprived quartile of neighborhood deprivation (β = 0.22, P = 0.02) in adjusted models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, relative to the least-deprived quartile (Q1), adults in more-deprived quartiles of neighborhood deprivation were more likely to experience either substantive BMI loss (Q2 relative risk ratio 1.19, 95% CI 1.00-1.41; Q3 1.20, 1.02-1.42; Q4 1.30, 1.08-1.55) or gain (Q2 1.25, 1.04-1.49; Q3 1.24, 1.04-1.49; Q4 1.45, 1.20-1.75).CONCLUSIONSGreater neighborhood deprivation was positively associated with BMI change among adults with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> as well as with clinically substantive BMI loss or gain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Findings stress the importance of allowing for simultaneous associations with both gain and loss in future longitudinal studies of neighborhood deprivation and weight change, which may be particularly true for studies of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for whom both <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and gain have health implications </plain></SENT>
