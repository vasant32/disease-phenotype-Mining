<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to investigate amino acid metabolism in endotoxaemic type 2 diabetic <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A metabolic study was performed over 4 days using male <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats (fa/fa) and lean littermates (fa/+) divided into three groups: ad libitum-fed groups which underwent no treatment, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS)-treated groups receiving E. coli LPS by i.p. injection, and pair-fed groups to the respective LPS groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the effect of endotoxaemia on body weight, food intake and tissue weights </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nitrogen loss and muscular proteolysis were measured daily by determination of urinary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27596">3-methylhistidine</z:chebi> (3-MH) excretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma, intestine and muscle amino acid levels were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The data showed that ad libitum-fed ZDF rats had lower plasma arginine and glutamine levels than ad libitum-fed control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with control rats, the LPS-treated ZDF rats presented lower thymic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_624'>involution</z:mpath>, a lower 3-MH:<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio and higher cumulative nitrogen balance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Against our working hypothesis, ZDF rats did not show an impaired metabolic response, and even appeared to be less sensitive to the stress </plain></SENT>
