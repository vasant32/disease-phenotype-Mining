<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined clinically 2,003 subjects born in Helsinki between 1934 and 1944 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They had on average 11 measurements of height and weight between birth and 2 years of age, and seven measurements between 2 and 11 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> tolerance in adult life was assessed by a 75-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 311 subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 496 with IGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both IGT and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birthweight</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.0001 adjusting for current BMI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The risk of these conditions was increased by <z:hpo ids='HP_0004325'>low weight</z:hpo> gain between birth and 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A 1 SD increase in weight at 2 years was associated with an odds ratio for either type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or IGT of 0.76 (95% CI 0.69-0.84) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This effect was greatest in people who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birthweight</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Low growth in the first 6 months after birth was a critical period for the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in later life; other critical periods were associated with slow fetal growth and rapid increase in BMI between age 2 and 11 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0004325'>Low weight</z:hpo> gain during infancy increases the risk of IGT and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The effect is greater in people who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birthweight</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The first 6 months after birth may be the most critical period for growth, in relation to development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
