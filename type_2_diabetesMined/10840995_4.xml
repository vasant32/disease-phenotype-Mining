<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the diagnostic performance characteristics of HNF1A genotyping for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) in Canadian Oji-Cree Indians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Oji-Cree subjects &gt; or = 50 years of age (96 subjects) who had participated in a community-wide prevalence survey for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects were classified either as having "disease," which included type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and IGT, or not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects were genotyped for the HNF1A G319S mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of disease in this group was 65.7%, of whom 71.4% had type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For a carrier of HNF1A S319, the specificity, sensitivity, and positive and negative predictive values were 97.0, 30.1, 95.0, and 42.1%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When the pretest disease prevalence was accounted for, the probability of disease after a positive test was 97.2%, and the probability of disease after a negative test was 42.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The values were very similar for the subgroup of subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The HNF1A genotype appears to be the most specific genetic test yet reported for the prediction of a common multifactorial disease by applying present-day standards of clinical epidemiology in molecular genetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A positive test result had particular diagnostic value in the Oji-Cree: a subject with HNF1A S319 was virtually certain of having <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or IGT by 50 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, a subject without HNF1A S319 had a reduced risk compared with the age-specific prevalence but was not totally risk-free </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Because HNF1A S319 was not the only predisposing factor for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the Oji-Cree, subjects without HNF1A S319 were still at some risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or IGT </plain></SENT>
