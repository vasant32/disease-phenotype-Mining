<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: We previously identified the transcription factor activating enhancer-binding protein-2beta (AP-2beta) gene as a new candidate for conferring susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To ascertain the possible involvement of AP-2beta in the pathogenesis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> we examined the effects of AP-2beta on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We measured the insulin secretion stimulated by <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27999">tolbutamide</z:chebi>, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi> in the HIT-T15 cells infected with adenovirus vectors encoding AP-2beta or LacZ (control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified clear expression of AP-2beta in isolated rat pancreatic islets and in HIT-T15 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi>-induced increase in insulin secretion was significantly inhibited in AP-2beta-overexpressing cells (LacZ, 5.0+/-0.8 ng h(-1)mg(-1) protein; AP-2beta, 1.7+/-0.2 ng h(-1)mg(-1) protein; P=0.0015), whereas insulin expression was the same in both types of cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="27999">Tolbutamide</z:chebi>-induced insulin secretion was also suppressed in the AP-2beta-overexpressing cells, but <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi>-induced insulin secretion was not affected by AP-2beta overexpression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, Kir6.2 and glucokinase expression was significantly decreased in the AP-2beta-overexpressing cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We identified for the first time that AP-2beta expressed and functioned in insulin-secreting cell-line HIT-T15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that AP-2beta contributes to susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by inhibiting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells </plain></SENT>
