<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effects of a novel, long-acting human GLP-1 analogue, taspoglutide, in the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> diabetic fatty (ZDF) rat, an animal model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and plasma levels of insulin, <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> YY (PYY), <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent insulinotropic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (GIP) and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> were measured during oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests (oGTT) conducted in ZDF rats treated acutely or chronically with a single long-acting dose of taspoglutide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">Pioglitazone</z:chebi> was used as a positive control in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, body weight, glycaemic control and insulin sensitivity were assessed over 21 days in chronically treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> treatment with taspoglutide reduced <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excursion and increased insulin response during oGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In chronically treated rats, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excursion and levels of GIP, PYY and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> during oGTT on day 21 were significantly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were significantly lower than vehicle controls by day 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A significant reduction in body <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> was noticed by day 8, and continued until the end of the study when body weight was approximately 7% lower in rats treated with taspoglutide compared to vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Glycaemic control (increased levels of 1,5-anhydroglucitol) and insulin sensitivity (Matsuda index) were improved by taspoglutide treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Taspoglutide showed typical effects of native GLP-1, with improvement in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, body weight, glycaemic control and insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
