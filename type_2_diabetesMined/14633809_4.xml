<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the effects of menopausal status on postprandial clearance of dietary fat in healthy and diabetic women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Fasting subjects (premenopausal and postmenopausal control subjects, premenopausal and postmenopausal diabetic women, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> n = 8) were given a meal containing the stable isotope 1,1,1-(13)C-tripalmitin, with blood and breath sampled for 6 and 24 h, respectively, in the postprandial period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lower levels of (13)C-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15756">palmitic acid</z:chebi> ((13)C-PA) in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> fraction implies more efficient chylomicron clearance, lower levels of (13)C-PA in the nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) fraction implies improved dietary NEFA entrapment, and higher levels of (13)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> in the breath denote more efficient of oxidation of dietary-derived <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In diabetic women, there were no differences between the pre- and postmenopausal groups for any of these parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, premenopausal control subjects, compared with postmenopausal control subjects, had lower (13)C-PA in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> fraction area under the curve (AUC) (premenopausal median [range] 25.2 [12.1-49.4 mmol/l] per 6 h, postmenopausal 48.5 [15.5-77.2 mmol/l] per 6 h; P &lt; 0.01) and higher (13)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> levels in the breath AUC (premenopausal 22.5 [18.0-31.5%] of administered dose, postmenopausal 17.2 [11.2-31.5%] of administered dose; P &lt; 0.01) with no difference between groups in levels of (13)C-PA in the NEFA fraction AUC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The premenopausal advantage in clearance of dietary <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> is not seen in premenopausal diabetic women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is likely to promote an atherogenic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> profile and may contribute to the loss of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> protection seen in diabetic women </plain></SENT>
