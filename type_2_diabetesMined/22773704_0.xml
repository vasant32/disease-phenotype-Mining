<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe the prevalence and determinants of hyperfiltration (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] ≥120 mL/min/1.73 m(2)), GFR decline, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> or progression in type 2 diabetic patients with normo- or <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We longitudinally studied 600 hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> &lt;200 μg/min and who were retrieved from two randomized trials testing the renal effect of trandolapril and delapril </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Target blood pressure (BP) was &lt;120/80 mmHg, and HbA(1c) was &lt;7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>GFR, <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp>, and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal rate (GDR) were centrally measured by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31709">iohexol</z:chebi> plasma clearance, nephelometry in three consecutive overnight urine collections, and hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over a median (range) follow-up of 4.0 (1.7-8.1) years, GFR declined by 3.37 (5.71-1.31) mL/min/1.73 m(2) per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>GFR change was bimodal over time: a larger reduction at 6 months significantly predicted slower subsequent decline (coefficient: -0.0054; SE: 0.0009), particularly among hyperfiltering patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 90 subjects (15%) were hyperfiltering at inclusion, and 11 of 47 (23.4%) patients with persistent hyperfiltration progressed to micro- or macroalbuminuria versus 53 (10.6%) of the 502 who had their hyperfiltration ameliorated at 6 months or were nonhyperfiltering since inclusion (hazard ratio 2.16 [95% CI 1.13-4.14]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Amelioration of hyperfiltration was independent of baseline characteristics or ACE inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It was significantly associated with improved BP and metabolic control, amelioration of GDR, and slower long-term GFR decline on follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite intensified treatment, patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have a fast GFR decline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Hyperfiltration affects a subgroup of patients and may contribute to renal function loss and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> or progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Whether amelioration of hyperfiltration is renoprotective is worth investigating </plain></SENT>
