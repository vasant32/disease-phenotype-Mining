<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> is widely used as a hypoglycaemic reagent for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While the reduction of hepatic gluconeogenesis is thought to be a key effect, the detailed molecular mechanism of action of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> remains to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To gain insight into this, we performed a global gene expression profiling study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed DNA microarray analysis to study global gene expression in the livers of <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> diabetic db/db mice 2 h after a single administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (400 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: This analysis identified 14 genes that showed at least a 1.5-fold difference in expression following <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> treatment, including a reduction of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-6-phosphatase gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-6-phosphatase showed one of the best correlations with blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels among 12,000 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Enzymatic activity of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-6-phosphatase was also reduced in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>-treated liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, intensive analysis of the expression profile revealed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> effected significant alterations in gene expression across at least ten metabolic pathways, including those involved in glycolysis-gluconeogenesis, fatty acid metabolism and amino acid metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These results suggest that reduction of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-6-phosphatase activity, as well as suppression of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression levels of this gene, in liver is of prime importance for controlling blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels in vivo, at least at early time points after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results also suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> not only affects expression of specific genes, but also alters the expression level of multiple genes linked to the metabolic pathways involved in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism in the liver </plain></SENT>
