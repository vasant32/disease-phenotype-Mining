<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Men from the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, who were initially free of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (n = 41,615), were followed for â‰¤ 20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Healthy Eating Index (HEI) 2005, the alternative HEI (aHEI) the Recommended Food Score, the alternative Mediterranean Diet (aMED) Score, and the Dietary Approaches to Stop <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> (DASH) Score were calculated from food-frequency questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazard models with time-varying covariates were used to assess risk by quintiles and continuous intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 2,795 incident cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After multivariate adjustment, the aHEI, aMED, and DASH scores were significantly associated with reduced risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A 1-SD increase was associated with 9-13% reduced risk (P &lt; 0.01), and the DASH score was associated with lower risk independent of other scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These scores were associated with lower absolute risk among those who were overweight or <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> weight (P for interaction &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Several diet-quality scores were associated with a lower risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and reflect a common dietary pattern characterized by high intakes of plant-based foods such as whole grains; moderate alcohol; and low intakes of red and processed meat, <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>, sugar-sweetened beverages, and trans fat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>High-quality diets may yield the greatest reduction in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> cases when followed by those with a high BMI </plain></SENT>
