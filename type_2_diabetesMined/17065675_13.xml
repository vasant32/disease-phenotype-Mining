<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To analyze trends in health care costs in the decade after identification of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, contrasting type 1 and 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The Canadian National <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Surveillance System criteria were applied to administrative databases to identify incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> cases in 1992 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cases were categorized as type 1 or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> based on patterns of drug use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Per capita health care costs (in 2001 Canadian dollars) for five resource categories were estimated according to the type of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, for the year before identification (1991) and 10 years after (1992-2001) identification of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 156 type 1 and 3,469 type 2 incident cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, from a population base of approximately 950,000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean (+/-SD) age of case subjects at index was 61.2 +/- 16.7 years, and 54% of subjects were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall annual per capita health expenditures rose considerably in the year after identification of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> but then stabilized at a lower level for the next 9 years, ranging from $3,800 to $4,400 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>From 1992 to 2001, diabetic individuals used $137.1 million in health care resources, most of which (96%) was attributable to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The average 10-year cost per individual with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was $37,820 ($33,684 per type 1 and $38,006 per type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> case; adjusted P = 0.45) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Total health expenditures for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are driven by the much larger prevalence of type 2 compared with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Policymakers need to acknowledge and allocate resources for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention and management accordingly </plain></SENT>
