<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe a unique multidisciplinary outpatient intervention for patients at high risk for lower-extremity <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients with foot <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> and considered to be high risk for lower-extremity <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath> were referred to the High Risk Foot Clinic of Operation Desert Foot at the Carl T </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hayden Veterans Affairs' Medical Center in Phoenix, Arizona, where patients received simultaneous vascular surgery and podiatric triage and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Some 124 patients, consisting of 90 diabetic patients and 34 nondiabetic patients, were initially seen between 1 October 1991 and 30 September 1992 and followed for subsequent rate of lower-extremity <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In a mean follow-up period of 55 months (range 3-77), only 18 of 124 patients (15%) required <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath> at the level of the thigh or leg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 18 amputees, 17 (94%) had type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rate of avoiding limb loss was 86.5% after 3 years and 83% after 5 years or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, of the 15 amputees surviving longer than 2 months, only one (7%) had to undergo <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath> of the contralateral limb over the following 12-65 months (mean 35 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with nondiabetic patients, patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had a 7.68 odds ratio for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath> (95% CI 5.63-9.74) (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A specialized clinic for prevention of lower-extremity <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath> is described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Initial and contralateral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath> rates appear to be far lower in this population than in previously published reports for similar populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Relative to patients without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were more than seven times as likely to have a lower-extremity <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that aggressive collaboration of vascular surgery and podiatry can be effective in preventing lower-extremity <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath> in the high-risk population </plain></SENT>
