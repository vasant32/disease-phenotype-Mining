<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using population estimates from National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys, we compared distribution of FPG, HbA(1c) and FI in non-diabetic US persons who were &gt;or=20 years old in 1999 to 2006 with that in persons of the same age in 1988 to 1994 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Age-, sex- and race-adjusted mean FPG levels between the two study periods did not change, but mean HbA(1c) and FI levels increased (0.10% and 4.8 pmol/l, respectively; p &lt; 0.001 for both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The increased HbA(1c) level was driven largely by an upward shift in the lower end of the HbA(1c) distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the increased FI level was driven primarily by an upward shift in the middle and higher end of FI distribution, especially among persons aged 20 to 44 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After adjustments for BMI or waist circumference, the increase in the mean HbA(1c) level was attenuated (0.06%; p &lt; 0.001), whereas the mean FPG level decreased by 0.1 mmol/l (p &lt; 0.001) and the mean FI level no longer demonstrated significant change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Despite little change in the distribution of FPG levels, HbA(1c) and FI levels increased in the non-diabetic population in the past decade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The increase in FI levels suggests that levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> were greater among US adults, especially young adults, than in the previous decade </plain></SENT>
