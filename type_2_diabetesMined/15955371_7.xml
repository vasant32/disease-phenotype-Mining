<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and beta-cell failure are genetically determined to some extent; however, environmental factors contribute to exacerbate both abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Type 2 diabetic individuals are also characterised by reduced beta-cell mass likely due to increased cellular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The early use of insulin therapy in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may prove beneficial to prevent further beta-cell loss and need for exogenous insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment options with oral agents are quite diverse, including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">insulin sensitizers</z:chebi>, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, and beta-cell secretagogues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although in recent years the emphasis on initial therapy has been shifting from insulin secretagogues to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">insulin sensitizers</z:chebi> such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi>, questions remain as to genetic and/or phenotypic factors may dictate a different choice of the first <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drug to be used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is not totally clear whether monotherapy should be pursued until the maximally effective dose of a given drug or combination therapy should be used to target distinct pathogenic defects in a single patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Individual phenotypic and genetic characterisation of the patients may help to solve this conundrum, eventually providing tailored treatment algorithms </plain></SENT>
