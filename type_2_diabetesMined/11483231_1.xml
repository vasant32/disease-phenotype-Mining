<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the relations between serum leptin levels and clinical efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-five type 2 diabetic patients (23 men and 22 women) from our outpatient clinic were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> 400 mg daily for 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG), HbA1c, body weight, serum insulin and leptin concentrations were measured before and after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 12 weeks of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> treatment, FPG (before versus after, 179+/-33 vs. 138+/-26 mg/dl, mean+/-SD), HbA1c (7.8+/-1.3 vs. 6.9+/-1.0%), IRI (8.3+/-4.3 vs. 6.3+/-3.4 microU/ml) and HOMA-R index (homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>) (3.8+/-2.4 vs. 2.2+/-1.3) decreased significantly, while body mass index (BMI) slightly increased (26.3+/-3.5 vs. 26.6+/- 3.6 kg/m(2)), and serum leptin remained unchanged (8.5+/-7.2 vs. 9.1+/-8.7 ng/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reduction in FPG (DeltaFPG) after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> treatment were correlated with reduction in HOMA-R (DeltaHOMA-R) (r=0.721, P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DeltaFPG was correlated with serum leptin (r=0.441, P&lt;0.01), HOMA-R (r=0.460, P&lt;0.01) and FPG (r=-0.781, P&lt;0.0001) at baseline, but not with BMI and serum IRI at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, serum leptin at baseline was significantly correlated with DeltaHOMA-R (r=0.634, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Leptin concentration before treatment therefore, can be used as an predictor for clinical efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
