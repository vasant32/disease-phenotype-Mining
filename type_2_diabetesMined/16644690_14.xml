<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its use as a risk marker in children is less clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 839 children aged 8 years from a representative birth cohort, circulating adiponectin levels were associated with body weight, BMI, waist circumference, and fasting and 30-min insulin levels, but the associations were opposite in boys, with positive associations, and girls, with inverse associations (P = 0.008-0.00001 for interaction with sex) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Girls had overall higher adiponectin, higher total cholesterol, lower <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, and higher <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels than boys, even after adjustment for BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With increasing BMI, girls showed steeper declines in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (P = 0.01 for interaction) and adiponectin levels (P = 0.0005 for interaction) and a steeper increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels (P = 0.009 for interaction) compared with boys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, plasma adiponectin is not a simple marker of central fat and insulin sensitivity in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With increasing BMI, decreasing adiponectin levels in girls could contribute to their faster deterioration in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profiles in comparison with boys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest a complex age- and sex-related regulation of adiponectin secretion or clearance </plain></SENT>
