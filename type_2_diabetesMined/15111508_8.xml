<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Multipoint linkage analyses for insulin sensitivity phenotypes were conducted in 1,280 Mexican Americans from 41 families who participated in the San Antonio Family Heart Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A significant linkage signal (logarithm of odds [LOD] = 2.98) affecting corrected insulin response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was detected on chromosome 13q between D13787 and D13S252, in the region where the MODY-4 gene has previously been mapped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Another signal on chromosome 13 was observed at D13S285 (LOD = 1.86), where the insulin receptor substrate 2 gene resides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant linkage (LOD = 3.09) for insulin response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was found on chromosome 8 between D8S1130 and D8S1106, near the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> lipase and macrophage scavenger receptor genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multipoint analysis of abdominal skinfold with an LOD of 2.68 showed signals in the same region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was also suggestive evidence for linkage of quantitative insulin sensitivity check index and fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> to a previously reported location at D9S301 (LOD = 2.19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that chromosomal locations on 8p and 13q might harbor genes that affect a variety of insulin- and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-related phenotypes that contribute to the observed variations in these important risk factors for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Mexican Americans </plain></SENT>
