<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Different components of MetS were assessed in 1099 healthy Finnish male military conscripts of about 19 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of MetS and its components, according to criteria given by the International <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Federation (IDF) and the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (ATPIII), were calculated for different BMI categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on the complete sample, prevalence of MetS, according to IDF and ATPIII criteria, was 6.8 and 3.5%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MetS prevalence increased in parallel with an increase in BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> persons it occurred in 55.4 and 27.2% according to IDF and ATPIII criteria, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our observations on MetS prevalences (which were especially high in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> service men) were in line with those few studies carried out earlier in the USA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We recommend that health education focus on those individuals that show an elevated risk of developing, already in young adulthood, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
