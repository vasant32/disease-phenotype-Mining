<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, identification of patients is based commonly on autoantibody (Ab) detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine whether measuring T-cell reactivity to islet proteins compared with measuring Abs improves detection of autoimmune <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and how beta-cell function correlates with T-cell reactivity compared with Ab positivity, we assessed the T-cell proliferative responses and Ab responses (islet cell autoantibodies, insulin autoantibodies, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021670" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">insulinoma</z:e>-associated protein-2 autoantibodies, and GAD Abs) to islet proteins of 36 phenotypic type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To be considered Ab(+) or T-cell(+), patients were required to be positive for a minimum of two consecutive time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>beta-Cell function was measured with fasting and glucagon-stimulated C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Independent of T-cell reactivity, Ab(+) and Ab(-) patients had comparable fasting and glucagon-stimulated C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Independent of Ab status, T-cell(+) patients demonstrated significantly lower glucagon-stimulated (P &lt; 0.003) C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> compared with T-cell(-) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that measuring T-cell responses to multiple islet proteins in phenotypic type 2 diabetic patients improves identification of patients with autoimmune <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and delineates those who have a more severe beta-cell lesion compared with Ab assessment alone </plain></SENT>
