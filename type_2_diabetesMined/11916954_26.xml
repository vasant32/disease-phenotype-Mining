<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have indicated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta-cell dysfunction</z:hpo> predicts the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, although it is unknown whether the use of combinations of insulin secretory measures further improves prediction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin Resistance</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Study is a prospective, multicenter, epidemiological study of the relationship between insulin sensitivity and the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At baseline, fasting concentrations of insulin, intact proinsulin (PI), and split PI were measured, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin response (AIR) was determined during a frequently sampled intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (FSIGTT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects who were nondiabetic at baseline (n = 903) were reexamined after 5 years of follow-up; 148 had developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In separate logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, clinic, and ethnicity, 1 SD differences in measures of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta-cell dysfunction</z:hpo> were associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence (AIR: odds ratio [OR] 0.37, 95% CI 0.27-0.52; intact PI: OR 1.90, 95% CI 1.57-2.30; split PI: OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.63-2.31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After additional adjustment for BMI, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo>, and insulin sensitivity, these measures continued to be significantly associated with risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in models that included both PI and AIR, each was an independent predictor, and individuals who had combined low AIR and high PI experienced the highest <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, both low AIR and high PI independently predicted <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a well-characterized multiethnic population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although fasting PI is simpler to assess, determining AIR from an FSIGTT may further improve prediction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>If pharmacological agents to prevent <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are proved to be efficacious in ongoing clinical trials, then it may be beneficial to perform FSIGTTs to identify better (for intensive intervention) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetic</z:e> subjects who would ultimately require lifelong pharmacological therapy </plain></SENT>
