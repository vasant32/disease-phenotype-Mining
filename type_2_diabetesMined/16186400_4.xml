<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In healthy humans, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> increases methionine transmethylation, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> transsulfuration, and clearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No such data exist in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> either in the fasting state or in response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To this purpose, seven male type 2 diabetic patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> (1.2 +/- 0.4 g/day, three with mild to moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal insufficiency</z:hpo>) and seven matched control subjects were infused for 6 h with L-[<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-(2)H(3), 1-(13)C]methionine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Methionine flux, transmethylation, and disposal into proteins as well as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> remethylation, transsulfuration, and clearance were determined before and after euglycemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> (approximately 1,000 pmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In type 2 diabetic subjects, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> concentration was twofold greater (P &lt; 0.01) and methionine transmethylation and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> clearance lower (from approximately 15 to &gt;50% and from approximately 40 to &gt;100%, respectively; P &lt; 0.05) than in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The insulin-induced increments of methionine transmethylation, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> transsulfuration, and clearance were markedly reduced in type 2 diabetic subjects (by more than threefold, P &lt; 0.05 or less vs. control subjects) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, methionine <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> and carbon flux were not increased in the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, pathways of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> disposal are impaired in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, both in postabsorptive and insulin-stimulated states, possibly accounting for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperhomocysteinemia</z:e> of this condition </plain></SENT>
