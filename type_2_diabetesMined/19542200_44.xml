<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27365">Zinc ions</z:chebi> are essential for the formation of hexameric insulin and hormone crystallization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism rs13266634 in the SLC30A8 gene, encoding the secretory granule zinc transporter ZnT8, is associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe the effects of deleting the ZnT8 gene in mice and explore the action of the at-risk allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Slc30a8 null mice were generated and backcrossed at least twice onto a C57BL/6J background </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> and insulin tolerance were measured by intraperitoneal injection or euglycemic clamp, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Insulin secretion, electrophysiology, imaging, and the generation of adenoviruses encoding the low- (W325) or elevated- (R325) risk ZnT8 alleles were undertaken using standard protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ZnT8(-/-) mice displayed age-, sex-, and diet-dependent abnormalities in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, insulin secretion, and body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Islets isolated from null mice had reduced granule zinc content and showed age-dependent changes in granule <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, with markedly fewer dense cores but more rod-like crystals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion, granule fusion, and insulin crystal dissolution, assessed by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, were unchanged or enhanced in ZnT8(-/-) islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Insulin processing was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Molecular modeling revealed that residue-325 was located at the interface between ZnT8 monomers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Correspondingly, the R325 variant displayed lower apparent Zn(2+) transport activity than W325 ZnT8 by fluorescence-based assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ZnT8 is required for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> insulin crystallization and insulin release in vivo but not, remarkably, in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Defects in the former processes in carriers of the R allele may increase type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risks </plain></SENT>
