<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Now that reduction in beta-cell mass has been clearly established in humans with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2D), the debate focuses on the possible mechanisms responsible for decreased beta-cell number </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Appropriate inbred <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519106" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">rodent models</z:e> are essential tools for this purpose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The information available from the Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rat, one of the best characterized animal models of spontaneous T2D, is reviewed in such a perspective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We propose that the defective beta-cell mass in the GK model reflects mostly a persistently decreased beta-cell neogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The data discussed in this review are consistent with the notion that poor proliferation and/or survival of the <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> precursor cells during GK foetal life will result in a decreased pool of <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> precursors in the pancreas, and hence an impaired capacity of beta-cell neogenesis (either primary in the foetus or compensatory in the newborn and the adult) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As we also demonstrated that beta-cell neogenesis can be pharmacologically reactivated in the GK model, our work supports, on a more prospective basis, the concept that facilitation of T2D treatment may be obtained through beta-cell mass expansion after stimulation of beta-cell regeneration/neogenesis in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
