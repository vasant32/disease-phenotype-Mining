<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether endogenous insulin secretion in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> has different effects on GA and A1C levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A1C, GA, and GA-to-A1C ratio were compared in 202 type 2 diabetic patients by type of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Effect of beta-cell function determined by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-%beta) on GA-to-A1C ratio was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, GA-to-A1C ratio was compared between type 2 diabetic patients and 16 patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In type 2 diabetic patients, GA-to-A1C ratio was significantly higher in those treated with insulin than in those treated with diet or oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HOMA-%beta showed a significant inverse correlation with GA-to-A1C ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This ratio was higher in type 1 diabetic patients than in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In diabetic patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0003059'>decreased insulin secretion</z:mp>, serum GA levels are higher relative to A1C </plain></SENT>
