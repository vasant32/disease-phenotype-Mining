<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To characterize the insulin sensitivity of overweight and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> 5- to 10-year-old (Tanner stage 1-3) African-American children screened for participation in a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention study and to identify the association of insulin sensitivity with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Measures of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (homeostasis model assessment) and insulin sensitivity (Matsuda and DeFronzo's whole-body insulin sensitivity) were calculated from a 2-h oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test in 137 African-American children recruited into a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Measures of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>, total cholesterol, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>), blood pressure, and body composition were obtained for a subset of the children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In response to a <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> challenge, girls and older and heavier children produced significantly more insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As BMI increased, there was a statistically significant decrease in insulin sensitivity, particularly in girls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity was inversely correlated with increases in blood pressure, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, subcutaneous fat, the percentage of total body fat, and Tanner stage, but it was not correlated with <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Reduced insulin sensitivity and the cluster of risk factors known as the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> syndrome (IRS) are already apparent in these overweight African-American children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Young African-American girls, in particular, already show evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> in response to a <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> load, suggesting that the early stages of metabolic decompensation that lead to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are already occurring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Monitoring of those risk factors known to be part of IRS should become part of routine medical care for overweight or <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> African-American children </plain></SENT>
