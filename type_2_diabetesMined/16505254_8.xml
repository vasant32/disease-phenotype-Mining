<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has therefore been proposed both as a putative agent in the pathophysiology of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and as a valid target for therapeutic intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, the genes that encode the various AMPK subunits are intriguing candidates for the inherited basis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We therefore set out to test for the association of common variants in the genes that encode three selected AMPK subunits with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and related phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the seven genes that encode AMPK isoforms, we initially chose PRKAA2, PRKAB1, and PRKAB2 because of their higher prior probability of association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, based on previous reports of genetic linkage, functional molecular studies, expression patterns, and pharmacological evidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We determined their haplotype structure, selected a subset of tag single nucleotide polymorphisms that comprehensively capture the extent of common genetic variation in these genes, and genotyped them in family-based and case/control samples comprising 4,206 individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of single-marker and multi-marker tests revealed no association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, or insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Several nominal associations of variants in PRKAA2 and PRKAB1 with BMI appear to be consistent with statistical noise </plain></SENT>
