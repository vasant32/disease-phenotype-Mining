<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> can be detected in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pre-diabetic</z:e> (borderline fasting <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>) state is not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the association of impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (IFG) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001717'>coronary artery calcification</z:hpo> (CAC), a marker of subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, among participants without a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> or manifest <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Study participants (aged 45-75 years) of the population-based Heinz Nixdorf Recall Study were categorised into those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &lt;6.1 mmol/l) and those with IFG (<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &gt;or=6.1 to &lt;7.0 mmol/l), excluding participants with a history of CHD or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CAC was assessed by electron-beam computed tomography, and risk factors were assessed by extended interviews, anthropometric measurements and laboratory tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Various CAC cut-off points were used in multiple logistic and ordinal logistic regression models to estimate ORs and 95% CIs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 2,184 participants, more men had IFG than did women (37% vs 22%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Participants with IFG showed a higher prevalence of CAC &gt; 0 (men OR 1.90, 95% CI 1.33-2.70; women 1.63, 1.23-2.15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Risk factor adjustment weakened this association in both sexes (men 1.63, 1.12-1.36; women 1.26, 0.93-1.70) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When the age- and sex-specific 75th percentile was used as the cut-off point for CAC, the association further decreased in men (1.10, 0.81-1.50), but became stronger in women (1.41, 1.02-1.94) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These data support the hypothesis that CAC is already present in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pre-diabetic</z:e> state and that IFG has a modest and independent impact on the atherosclerotic process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Biological sex appears to modify the association between IFG and CAC </plain></SENT>
