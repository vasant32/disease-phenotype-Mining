<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether the joint risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> tracked within families, we assessed the correlation between a family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and intimal-medial thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) of the common carotid artery (CCA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Study subjects included 620 nondiabetic individuals from 24 families enrolled in the San Antonio Family Heart Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The thickness of the far walls of the CCA was measured by B-mode ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Statistical analyses included familial correlations to account for the nonindependence of family data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After adjusting for sex, age, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> reader effects, the heritability of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> in this population was 16% (P = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using a more comprehensive family history score that accounted for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> status of the individual's parents and older siblings, we observed a significant correlation between family history score and increased CCA <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> (0.006 mm increase in CCA <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> for every point increase of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> family history score, P = 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This association remained even after further adjustment for BMI, smoking, and fasting insulin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, the mean CCA <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> in those with high family history scores for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was still 0.037 mm thicker than those with low family history scores for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P = 0.040) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the genetic contribution to CCA <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> variability is modest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Also, the small increase in subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> observed even among nondiabetic Mexican Americans with a positive family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is probably transmitted along with the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> through shared etiologic risk factors between <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
