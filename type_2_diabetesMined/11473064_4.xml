<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Whereas increased urinary excretion of type IV collagen, which is believed to reflect renal overproduction of this extracellular matrix protein in early diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, has been confirmed in several studies, examination of serum concentrations of this analyte has yielded conflicting results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to clarify the relationship between early <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo> in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and circulating type IV collagen concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We measured serum (human) collagen IV concentrations by immunoassay in 109 patients with type 1 or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and various amounts of <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> extending from the normo- to the macroalbuminuric range, and we examined its relationship to albumin excretion and to serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum collagen IV concentrations (mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) were not significantly different in normoalbuminuric (219 +/- 10 ng/ml), microalbuminuric (209 +/- 6 ng/ml), or macroalbuminuric (206 +/- 7 ng/ml) diabetic subjects or in nondiabetic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers (206 +/- 10 ng/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Collagen IV concentrations showed no significant correlation (P &gt; 0.25) with albumin excretion (r = -0.001), HbA(1c) (r = 0.030), or serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> (r = -0.161) and were unrelated to urinary excretion of collagen IV in the subset of subjects in whom these data were available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of this cross-sectional analysis discount the utility of measurement of the serum concentration of collagen IV as an indicator of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo> in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increased urine excretion of collagen IV without a significant change in the serum concentration is consistent with a renal origin of this analyte in early diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
