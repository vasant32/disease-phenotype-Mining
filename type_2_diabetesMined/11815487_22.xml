<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Insulin concentrations oscillate at a periodicity of 5-15 min per oscillation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These oscillations are due to coordinate insulin secretory bursts, from millions of islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The generation of common secretory bursts requires strong within-islet and within-pancreas coordination to synchronize the secretory activity from the beta-cell population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The overall contribution of this pulsatile mechanism dominates and accounts for the majority of insulin release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This review discusses the methods involved in the detection and quantification of periodicities and individual secretory bursts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mechanism by which overall insulin secretion is regulated through changes in the pulsatile component is discussed for nerves, metabolites, hormones, and drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The impaired pulsatile secretion of insulin in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> has resulted in much focus on the impact of the insulin delivery pattern on insulin action, and improved action from oscillatory insulin exposure is demonstrated on liver, muscle, and adipose tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, not only is the dominant regulation of insulin through changes in secretory burst mass and amplitude, but the changes may affect insulin action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, the role of impaired pulsatile release in early type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> suggests a predictive value of studies on insulin pulsatility in the development of this disease </plain></SENT>
