<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight percent of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects were fast acetylators compared with 74% of the Type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetic and 54% of the Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This result for Type 1 diabetic patients was significantly different from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, while that for Type 2 patients was intermediate between the two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast to a previous report, there was no significant association of acetylator status with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> in subjects with either Type 1 or Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Acetylator status could be a genetic marker for Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but the increased proportion of fast acetylators in both groups suggested the possibility of an artefact due to high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rate of acetylation of sulphadimidine was significantly greater in both fast and slow acetylators with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects and there was a significant association between high plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and acetylator status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prospective studies will be necessary to confirm whether acetylator status is a true genetic marker for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
