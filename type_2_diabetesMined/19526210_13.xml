<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An open-label, 5 year, randomised (1:1), multicentre, stratified, parallel-group study conducted in the USA and Canada enrolled individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and either no or non-proliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (less than severe; Early Treatment Diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>Retinopathy</z:hpo> Study [ETDRS] level less than 53 in both eyes) who were treated with oral hypoglycaemic agents (OHAs) alone, insulin alone or OHAs with insulin for &gt;/=3 months prior to study entry and a baseline HbA(1c) level of 6.0-12.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomised by the investigator according to the centralised interactive voice response system to receive twice-daily <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin (n = 509) or once-daily basal insulin glargine (n = 515) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The investigator was not blinded to the treatment group to which each participant had been assigned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The main objective of this study was to compare the progression of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> between treatment groups by analysing the percentage of patients with three or more step progression in the ETDRS <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> patient-level severity scale after treatment with either basal insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Masked, centralised grading of seven-field stereoscopic fundus photographs was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Similarly sustained glycaemic control was observed in both the insulin glargine and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite a slightly greater severity of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> for the insulin glargine group at baseline, three or more step progression in ETDRS score from baseline to end-of-study was similar between treatment groups (14.2% [53/374] of insulin glargine-treated patients vs 15.7% [57/363] of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e>-treated patients); the difference in the incidence of progression was -1.98% (95% CI -7.02, 3.06%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Other measures of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>-the development of proliferative diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> and progression to clinically significant macular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo>-occurred to a similar degree in both treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No other safety issues, such as unexpected adverse events for either insulin emerged during the 5 year study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin treatment was associated with a higher incidence of severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> compared with insulin glargine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: This study shows no evidence of a greater risk of the development or progression of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> with insulin glargine vs <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin treatment in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
