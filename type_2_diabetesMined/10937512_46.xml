<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: To construct new EGs for type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients, a total of 100 experts of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were asked to assign any error in BG measurement to 1 of 5 risk categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used these EGs to evaluate the accuracy of self-monitoring of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (SMBG) levels in 152 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The SMBG data were used to compare the new type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> EG with a traditional EG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both the type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> EGs divide the risk plane into 8 concentric zones with no discontinuities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The new EGs are similar to each other, but they differ from the traditional EG in several significant ways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When used to evaluate a data set of measurements made by a sample of patients experienced in SMBG, the new type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> EG rated 98.6% of their measurements as clinically acceptable, compared with 95% for the traditional EG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The consensus EGs furnish a new tool for evaluating errors in the measurement of BG for patients with type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
