<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 741 patients (baseline HbA(1c) [A1C] 8.0%) were randomized to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> 100 or 200 mg or placebo for 24 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">Sitagliptin</z:chebi> 100 and 200 mg produced significant (P &lt; 0.001) placebo-subtracted reductions in A1C (-0.79 and -0.94%, respectively) and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (-1.0 mmol/l [-17.1 mg/dl] and -1.2 mmol/l [-21.3 mg/dl], respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with baseline A1C &gt;or=9% had greater reductions in placebo-subtracted A1C with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> 100 and 200 mg (-1.52 and -1.50%, respectively) than those with baseline A1C &lt;8% (-0.57 and -0.65%) or &gt;or=8 to &lt;9.0% (-0.80 and -1.13%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a meal tolerance test, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> 100 and 200 mg significantly decreased 2-h postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi>) (placebo-subtracted <z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi> -2.6 mmol/l [-46.7 mg/dl] and -3.0 mmol/l [-54.1 mg/dl], respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results for the above key efficacy parameters were not significantly different between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Homeostasis model assessment of beta-cell function and proinsulin-to-insulin ratio improved with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> was similar, and overall gastrointestinal adverse experiences were slightly higher with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No meaningful body weight changes from baseline were observed with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> 100 (-0.2 kg) or 200 mg (-0.1 kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The body weight change with placebo (-1.1 kg) was significantly (P &lt; 0.01) different from that observed with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this 24-week study, once-daily <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> monotherapy improved glycemic control in the fasting and postprandial states, improved measures of beta-cell function, and was well tolerated in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
