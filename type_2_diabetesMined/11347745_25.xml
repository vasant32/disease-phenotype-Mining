<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the peripheral blood mtDNA (pb-mtDNA) content is decreased and linked to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in the offspring of type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 82 offspring of type 2 diabetic patients and 52 age-, sex-, and BMI-matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects from the Mokdong, Korea, population were selected for this study by stratified, randomized sampling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the offspring of diabetic patients, 52 had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (NGT), 21 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT), and 9 had newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pb-mtDNA content was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction with a mitochondria-specific <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39442">fluorescent probe</z:chebi>, normalized by a nuclear DNA, 285 rRNA gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The associations between pb-mtDNA content and several parameters of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The pb-mtDNA contents tended to be lower in the 82 offspring of type 2 diabetic patients (1,084.7 +/- 62.6 vs. 1,304.0 +/- 99.2 in the offspring and control subjects, respectively, P = 0.051) and was significantly lower in the combined NGT and IGT offspring group (NGT+IGT, 1,068.0 +/- 67.8, P &lt; 0.05) than in the control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In NGT+IGT offspring, the pb-mtDNA content was significantly correlated with logarithmically transformed insulin sensitivity (r = 0.253, P &lt; 0.05) and was the main predictor of insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative mtDNA status might be a hereditary factor associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and could serve as an indicator for insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
