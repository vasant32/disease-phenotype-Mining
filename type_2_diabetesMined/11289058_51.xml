<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The allele frequencies for a Pro12--&gt;Ala substitution in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma differ among ethnic groups, and its relationship with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and associated diseases is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of this polymorphism and its effects on clinical characteristics have now been evaluated with a large number of Japanese individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 2,201) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects (n = 1,212) recruited by 10 institutions located in seven different cities in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The allele frequency for the Ala12 variant was significantly lower in the type 2 diabetic group than in the control group (2.39 vs. 4.13%, P = 0.000054) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, compared with subjects without the Ala12 variant, the diabetic subjects with this variant exhibited a significantly higher serum concentration of total cholesterol (P = 0.001), manifested a reduced capacity for insulin secretion as evaluated by homeostasis model assessment (P = 0.007), and tended to possess a higher level of HbA1c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the Ala12 variant is associated with a reduced risk for the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the general population, but that it may be also a risk factor for insulin deficiency and disease severity in individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
