<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, few have assessed risk factors for AP specifically in T2DM patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients in the General Practice Research Database (2 984 755, 5.0% with T2DM) were used to estimate incidence of AP for T2DM relative to non-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, adjusting for prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001733'>pancreatitis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016977" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gallbladder disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, smoking and alcohol use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariate Cox regression analysis adjusting for risk factors and Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between 2003 and 2007, 301 of 148 903 patients with T2DM and 2434 of almost 3 million patients without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> developed AP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with T2DM had higher risk for AP compared with patients without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (crude HR: 2.89, 95% CI: 2.56-3.27) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with T2DM had significantly higher rates of prior alcohol and tobacco exposure (44.2 and 61.9% vs. 34.1 and 35.9%, p &lt; 0.001) and of comorbid conditions (14.7% with CCI &gt; or =1 vs. 4.3%, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histories of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001733'>pancreatitis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016977" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gallbladder disease</z:e>, smoking or alcohol use were significant predictors of AP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for these factors, age, gender and comorbidities, the risk of developing AP remained elevated in patients with T2DM (adjusted HR: 1.49, 95% CI: 1.31-1.70) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: After adjusting for risk factors, patients with T2DM had an elevated risk of AP compared with patients without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Physicians should be aware of the increased risk in patients with T2DM, particularly in those with prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001733'>pancreatitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
