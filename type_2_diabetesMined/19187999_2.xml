<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DM2</z:e> patients (48.5+/-8.6 years) without evident <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> and 50 age- and sex-matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (47.6+/-8.8 years) were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Conventional echocardiography, tissue Doppler imaging and acoustic densitometry of both groups were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HbA1c of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DM2</z:e> patients were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no significant differences in systolic indexes between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean LV myocardial early diastolic velocity Em and Em/Am were lower in DM group than control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean LV myocardial late diastolic velocity Am and E/Em were higher in DM group than control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IVS-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e>% and LVPW-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e>% were higher in DM group than control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IVS-CVIB and LVPW-CVIB were lower in DM group than control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>HbA1c was negatively correlated with E/A (gamma=-0.310, P&lt;0.05), Em (gamma=-0.409, P&lt;0.01), Em/Am (gamma=-0.380, P&lt;0.01) and positively correlated with E/Em (gamma=0.488, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Significant positive correlation was present between HbA1c and IVS-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e>% (gamma=0.679, P&lt;0.01), LVPW-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e>% (gamma=0.666, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The diastolic dysfunction and abnormal myocardial acoustic densitometry exist before the systolic function damage in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DM2</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Tissue Doppler imaging and ultrasonic integrated backscatter can be used as sensitive means for early assessing myocardial histological changes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DM2</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>HbA1c is related with both diastolic dysfunction and acoustic densitometry </plain></SENT>
