<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This 1-year double-blind study (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00740051) enrolled T2DM patients with inadequate glycaemic control, treatment-naïve [glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA1c) 7.0-10.0%] or previously treated with one oral antidiabetes drug (HbA1c 6.5-9.0% before washout), ineligible for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> because of contraindications (e.g. <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal impairment</z:e>) or previous intolerable side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomized to monotherapy with linagliptin 5 mg once daily (n = 151) or placebo (n = 76) for 18 weeks, after which placebo patients switched to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> 1-4 mg once daily and treatments continued for another 34 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was change from baseline in HbA1c after 18 weeks (full-analysis set, last observation carried forward) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At week 18, adjusted mean difference in change from baseline HbA1c (8.1%) was -0.60% (95% confidence interval -0.88, -0.32; p &lt; 0.0001) (-0.39% with linagliptin, +0.21% with placebo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At week 52, mean HbA1c was decreased from baseline in both groups [linagliptin: -0.44%; placebo/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi>: -0.72% (observed cases)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adverse events occurred in 40.4 and 48.7% of linagliptin and placebo patients, respectively, during the initial 18 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During the 34-week extension, patients receiving linagliptin experienced less <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> (2.2% vs. 7.8%) and no <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> (mean change from baseline of -0.2 and +1.3 kg, respectively) compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In T2DM patients for whom <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> was inappropriate, linagliptin improved glycaemic control and was well tolerated, with less <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> and relative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
