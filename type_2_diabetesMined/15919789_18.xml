<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>GLUT2 is mainly expressed in the liver, beta-cells of the pancreas, and the basolateral membrane of kidney proximal tubules and plays an important role in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis in living organisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The transcription of the GLUT2 gene is known to be upregulated in the liver during postprandial hyperglycemic states or in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, a molecular mechanism by which <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> activates GLUT2 gene expression is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we report evidence that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15889">sterol</z:chebi> response element-binding protein (SREBP)-1c plays a key role in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated GLUT2 gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The GLUT2 promoter reporter is activated by SREBP-1c, and the activation is inhibited by a dominant-negative form of SREBP-1c (SREBP-1c DN) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adenoviral expression of SREBP-1c DN suppressed <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated GLUT2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level in primary hepatocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An electrophoretic mobility shift assay and mutational analysis of the GLUT2 promoter revealed that SREBP-1c binds to the -84/-76 region of the GLUT2 promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that the binding of SREBP-1c to the -84/-76 region was increased by <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that SREBP-1c mediates <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated GLUT2 gene expression in hepatocytes </plain></SENT>
