<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The efficacy, safety, and tolerability of a novel transdermal 2% <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> gel was evaluated over 12 months in 220 hypogonadal men with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and/or MetS in a multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was mean change from baseline in homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-IR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Secondary outcomes were measures of body composition, glycemic control, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, and sexual function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Efficacy results focused primarily on months 0-6 (phase 1; no changes in medication allowed) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Medication changes were allowed in phase 2 (months 6-12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TRT reduced HOMA-IR in the overall population by 15.2% at 6 months (P = 0.018) and 16.4% at 12 months (P = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In type 2 diabetic patients, glycemic control was significantly better in the TRT group than the placebo group at month 9 (HbA(1c): treatment difference, -0.446%; P = 0.035) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Improvements in total and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> a (Lpa), body composition, libido, and sexual function occurred in selected patient groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between groups in the frequencies of adverse events (AEs) or serious AEs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The majority of AEs (&gt;95%) were mild or moderate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Over a 6-month period, transdermal TRT was associated with beneficial effects on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, total and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL-cholesterol</z:chebi>, Lpa, and sexual health in hypogonadal men with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and/or MetS </plain></SENT>
