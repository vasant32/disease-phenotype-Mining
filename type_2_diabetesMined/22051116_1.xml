<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed an electronic literature search of published articles to identify relevant evidence since inception to June 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Primary outcome measures were metabolic improvement and resolution <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after bariatric surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The weighted mean difference (WMD) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated from the raw data extracted from the original literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The software Review Manager (version 4.3.1) was applied for meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirteen trials involving 357 patients were included in the meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The follow-up interval ranged from 6 months to 18 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>According to WMD calculation, bariatric surgery led to 5.18 kg/m(2) of BMI lowering (95% CI, 3.79-6.57, p &lt; 0.00001), 4.8 mmol/l of fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) decrement (95% CI, 3.88-5.71 mmol/l, p &lt; 0.00001), 2.59% of HbA1c decreasing (95% CI, 2.12-3.07%, p &lt; 0.00001), 56.67 mg/dl of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> decrement (95% CI 11.53-101.82, p = 0.01) and 48.38 mg/dl of total cholesterol reduction (95% CI 21.08-75.68, p = 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the procedures produced an increased <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> by 5.37 mg/dl (95% CI -11.37-0.63, p = 0.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, this effect was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall, 80.0% of the patients achieved adequate glycaemic control (HbA1c &lt; 7%) without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The surgeries produced a low incidence of major complications (3.2%) with no mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Bariatric surgery is effectual and safe in the treatment of non-severely <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (BMI &lt; 35 kg/m(2) ) T2DM patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the metabolic benefits acquired from the procedures can be long sustained after the surgery </plain></SENT>
