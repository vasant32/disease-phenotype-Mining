<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277558" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">familial disorder</z:e>, we tested this hypothesis by investigating the prevalence of GAD65 and IA-2 autoantibodies (Ab) in Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> multiplex families of Sardinian ancestry enrolled in the Study Group for the Genetics of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> in Sardinia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 684 individuals were ascertained from 252 Sardinian Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> multiplex families with 2.4 affected siblings per family comprising 190 families with two affected, 37 with three, 15 with four, 7 with five, and 3 with six, in addition to 80 unaffected siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Controls were household contacts representing 204 healthy spouses of affected siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis was at 35-69 years of age and insulin was not given in the first 4 years after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>GAD65Ab and IA-2Ab were determined in standard radioligand binding assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among affected siblings GAD65Ab were positive in 8.8% of insulin-treated (n = 137; P = 0.0006), in 2.5% of non-insulin-treated (n = 467), and in 1.2% of non-diabetic siblings (n = 80) compared with 0.5% of controls (n = 204) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IA-2Ab was positive in 6.6% insulin-treated (P = 0.04), 2.1% non-insulin-treated, and 2.5% non-diabetic siblings compared with 1.5% of controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A high frequency of GAD65Ab and IA-2Ab as markers of Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was found among Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> siblings from Sardinian multiplex families despite excluding those who had been treated with insulin during the first 4 years of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data support the hypothesis that LADA may be common in Sardinian Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and stress the importance of investigating markers of Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in studies of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
