<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to identify genetic polymorphisms in potential candidate genes for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by sequencing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> exons in the PCK genes (PCK1 and PCK2), and examining the association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and diabetic phenotypes in a Korean population (775 type 2 diabetic patients and 316 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-two polymorphisms in PCK1 and PCK2 were identified in a Korean population (n=24) by direct DNA sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The TaqMan genotyping method was applied for genotyping the remainder of the study population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Associations of PCK polymorphisms with the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and diabetic phenotypes were analysed using logistic and multiple regressions, adjusting for age, sex and BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although no significant associations between the genetic polymorphisms in PCK genes and the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were detected, in further haplotype analysis, one of the common haplotypes, PCK1 ht3, revealed susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (p=0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One 3' untranslated region (UTR) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) also showed an association with <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> levels among non-diabetic control subjects: individuals homozygous for the major allele (T/T) had the lowest <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> level (1.11+/-0.32 mmol/l), heterozygotes (T/C) had an intermediate level (1.27+/-0.37 mmol/l), and those homozygous for the minor allele (C/C) had the highest level (1.39+/-0.28 mmol/l) (p=0.000003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This 3' UTR SNP was also associated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels, with a lower <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> level observed among individuals who were homozygous for the minor allele (C/C) than among those who were not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The strong genetic association of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels with variation/haplotype information identified in this study would be useful for further genetic epidemiological studies of this important gene </plain></SENT>
