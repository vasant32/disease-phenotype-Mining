<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">High-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>) was separated from serum by the addition of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> phosphotungstate and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="6636">magnesium chloride</z:chebi>, and the precipitated fraction was prepared as non-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">Phospholipids</z:chebi> were extracted from whole serum, non-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> to estimate PCOOH level with chemiluminescence high performance liquid chromatography (CL-HPLC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PCOOH level (nmol/l, mean +/- S.D.) was higher in DM than in control (33.1 +/- 9.5 vs. 23.0 +/- 8.2 for serum; P &lt; 0.01, 17.0 +/- 5.5 vs. 10.6 +/- 3.8 for non-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>; P &lt; 0.01, and 16.1 +/- 6.3 vs. 12.3 +/- 5.5 for <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>; not significant, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DM was divided into five groups according to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c) (HbA(1c)) levels (%): (1) less than 6, (2) 6-6.4, (3) 6.5-6.9 (4) 7.0-7.4, and (5) over than 7.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increase of PCOOH levels was dependent on HbA(1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We concluded that (1) serum and non-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> PCOOH increased in DM, (2) the level was strongly correlated with diabetic control, and (3) approximately a half amount of serum PCOOH was present in <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> of both control and DM </plain></SENT>
