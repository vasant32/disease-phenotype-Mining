<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fasting serum was collected from 189 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, adiponectin was measure using radioimmunoassay and features of the MS were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean ALT was significantly higher in patients with the MS and higher ALT was associated with lower adiponectin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As the number of features of MS increased, ALT increased and adiponectin decreased independent of glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Hypoadiponectinemia and the MS may be linked with liver injury in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
