<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Islet dysfunction, characterized by the loss of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin secretory response (AIR) to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> is a well-established pathology of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using oral insulin secreting agents with very different pharmacodynamic profiles, the present study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that, within the setting of an underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, changes in the insulin response profile can differentially affect glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The mildly insulin resistant high-fat fed Sprague Dawley (HF) rat and the very insulin resistant <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> fatty (fa/fa) rat, chronically fitted with indwelling jugular cannula were subjected to an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> load </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compounds were administered 5 min before the oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> load </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nateglinide (Nateg) was administered to elicit only an early insulin secretory response and glipizide (Glip) to elicit a later but greater insulin secretory response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Acetaminophen was used as a marker to assess for potential effects of these compounds on gastric emptying rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nateg rapidly increased early insulin release (from -5 to 0) while the effects on total insulin release were similar to those in the controls and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excursions were eliminated in both diabetic models with no evidence of sustained <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conversely, Glip did not affect early insulin release but increased total insulin release (- 15 to 120 min), but only after the oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> load </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Glip partially curbed <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excursions in the mildly insulin resistant HF rodent and was totally ineffective in the very insulin resistant <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The differential effects could not be attributed to effects on gastric emptying rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data support the importance of early insulin release in type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and indicate that, independent of the level of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, stimulating insulin release early and briefly provides for more effective and tighter glycaemic control than increasing insulin exposure to a greater magnitude later </plain></SENT>
