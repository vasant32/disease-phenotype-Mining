<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In order to quantify the role of incretins in first- and second-phase insulin secretion (ISR) in type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM), a double-blind, randomized study with 12 T2DM subjects and 12 healthy subjects (HS) was conducted using the hyperglycemic clamp technique together with duodenal nutrition perfusion and intravenous infusion of the glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> 1 (GLP-1) receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> exendin(9-39) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> alone resulted in a significantly greater first- and second-phase ISR in HS compared with T2DM subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Duodenal nutrition perfusion augmented both first- and second-phase ISR but first-phase ISR more in T2DM subjects (approximately eight- vs. twofold) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi>-related stimulation of ISR contributed only 20% to overall ISR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Infusion with exendin(9-39) significantly reduced first- and second-phase ISR in both HS and T2DM subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, both GLP-1 and non-GLP-1 incretins contribute to the incretin effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, both phases of ISR are impaired in T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In particular, the responsiveness to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in first-phase ISR is blunted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>GLP-1 and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent insulinotropic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (GIP) secretions are unaltered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The absolute incretin effect is reduced in T2DM; its relative importance, however, appears to be increased, highlighting its role as an important amplifier of first-phase ISR in T2DM </plain></SENT>
