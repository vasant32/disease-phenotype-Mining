<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: In advanced stages of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, new blood vessels are formed based on undefined mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, leptin was shown to possess an angiogenic action in vitro and to induce neovascularization in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between plasma leptin levels and the severity of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: There were 70 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (age 47.9 +/- 9.7 years, BMI 26.4 +/- 3.3 kg/m2) who were seen in a retina outpatient clinic recruited and assigned to subgroups according to the stage of their diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 66 healthy volunteer subjects matched with the diabetic patients for age, BMI, and sex who served as control subjects (age 46.0 +/- 8.8 years, BMI 27.1 +/- 2.3 kg/m2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fasting plasma leptin levels were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Plasma leptin level of the diabetic patients was not significantly different from the control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with proliferative diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (n = 17), the mean plasma level of leptin (16.1 +/- 9.2 ng/ml) was significantly higher than that in patients with nonproliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (n = 20) (11.5 +/- 3.5 ng/ml, P = 0.039) or patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (n = 33) (5.8 +/- 3.7 ng/ml, P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean leptin level in patients with nonproliferative diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> was also significantly higher than that in patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the more advanced the diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, the higher the plasma leptin levels, even after adjusting the leptin levels for BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The presence of such a positive correlation need not imply a causal relationship </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, previously observed leptin-induced promotion of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and neovascularization lends support to the possibility that leptin may play a role in the progression of human diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> to a proliferative phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This possibility deserves further investigation </plain></SENT>
