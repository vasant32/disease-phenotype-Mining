<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions of nateglinide and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 12 type 2 diabetic subjects with the following baseline characteristics were enrolled: age, 56 +/- 13 years; BMI, 28.7 +/- 4.5 kg/m2; HbA1c, 8.4 +/- 1.3%; and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> 13 +/- 2.8 mmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects had been previously treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi> and were switched to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy for 3 weeks before study start </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects then randomly received, in combination with 500 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, either 120 mg nateglinide or placebo before meals for 1 day, followed by the alternate treatment 7 days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 1 week of washout from both drugs, subjects received 1 day of open-label nateglinide treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma concentrations of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, nateglinide, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> were assessed frequently during inpatient periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Postmeal plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were significantly lower in subjects treated with nateglinide plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> than in those treated with either drug alone (P &lt; 0.001), especially after lunch and dinner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Coadministration of nateglinide and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> did not affect the pharmacokinetics of either drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> treatments were safe and well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Combination therapy with nateglinide and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> was more effective than either treatment alone and did not result in any pharmacokinetic interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Coadministration of nateglinide and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> appears to be an excellent option for treating patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> not controlled with monotherapy </plain></SENT>
