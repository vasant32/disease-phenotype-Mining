<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates 1) that PPAR-gamma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression is not altered in subcutaneous adipose tissue (n = 44) or in skeletal muscle (n = 19) of subjects spanning a wide range of BMIs (20-53 kg/m2) and 2) that insulin acutely increases PPAR-gamma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in human adipocytes both in vivo and in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effect of insulin was investigated in abdominal subcutaneous biopsies obtained before and at the end of a 3-h euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Insulin significantly increased PPAR-gamma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels in lean subjects (88 +/- 17%, n = 6), in type 2 diabetic patients (100 +/- 19%, n = 6), and in nondiabetic <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients (91 +/- 20%, n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both PPAR-gamma1 and PPAR-gamma2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> variants were increased (P &lt; 0.05) after insulin infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In isolated human adipocytes, insulin induced the two PPAR-gamma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> in a dose-dependent manner, with half-maximal stimulation at a concentration of approximately 1-5 nmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, PPAR-gamma2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was rapidly (2 h) and transiently increased, whereas a slow and more progressive induction of PPAR-gamma1 was observed during the 6 h of incubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In explants of human adipose tissue, PPAR-gamma protein levels were significantly increased (42 +/- 3%, P &lt; 0.05) after 12 h of incubation with insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that PPAR-gamma belongs to the list of the insulin-regulated genes and that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are not associated with alteration in the expression of this nuclear receptor in adipose tissue </plain></SENT>
