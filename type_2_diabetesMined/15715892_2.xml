<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Design: Placebo-controlled clinical trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-three subjects with risk factors for type 2 DM were randomly assigned to receive 850 mg of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> or a placebo twice a day for 2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Before and after the treatment, the body mass index and waist/hip ratio were calculated, the body composition was measured through bioelectric impedance and the fasting levels of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> and cholesterol were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The level of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> was calculated by the homeostatic model and the level of sensitivity by the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Wilcoxon rank test was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-one subjects completed the study, 12 of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> group and nine of the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> group, there was a decrease in fat weight from 25.9 +/- 9.4 to 20.8 +/- 9.2 kg, p &lt; 0.01, an increase in lean weight from 57.05 +/- 13.6 to 61.9 +/- 16.5 kg, p &lt; 0.01, an increase in basal metabolism from 1735 +/- 413 to 1878 +/- 505 calories/day, p &lt; 0.05 and an increase in body water, p &lt; 0.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant decrease in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the placebo group, the blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> increased from 84.7 +/- 13 to 96.7 +/- 16 mg/dl, p &lt; 0.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no significant modifications in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> for 2 months improves the parameters of body composition and insulin dynamics in subjects with risk factors for type 2 DM </plain></SENT>
