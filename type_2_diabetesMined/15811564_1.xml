<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A commonly occurring nucleotide polymorphism of the insulin-receptor substrate 2 (IRS-2) gene at amino acid 1057 from Glycine to Asparaginic acid (G1057D) was recently shown to be a determinant of insulin sensitivity in both <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-tolerant individuals and those with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With respect to the latter, the IRS-2 D1057 allele increase the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> among <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After we reconstructed haplotypes from the G1057D variant and the -769C/T replacement that was newly identified, we investigated the possibility that the IRS-2 gene affects insulin sensitivity in Japanese <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-tolerant subjects (n = 260) and type 2 diabetic patients (n = 123) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We did not find that the D1057 allele and haplotype pairs were associated with the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, type 2 diabetic patients, particularly <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients, carrying the D1057 allele and the CA haplotype were associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we suggested that the TG and CG haplotypes might have a protective role against <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This observation raises the possibility that both the IRS-2 D1057 allele and the CA haplotype are useful genetic markers for identifying <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals who are particularly susceptible to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
