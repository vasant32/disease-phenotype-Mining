<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The optimal exercise modality for reductions of abdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and risk factors for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in youth is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the effects of aerobic exercise (AE) versus resistance exercise (RE) without caloric restriction on abdominal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e>, ectopic fat, and insulin sensitivity and secretion in youth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-five <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> adolescent boys were randomly assigned to one of three 3-month interventions: AE, RE, or a nonexercising control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Abdominal fat was assessed by magnetic resonance imaging, and intrahepatic <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> and intramyocellular <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> were assessed by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity and secretion were evaluated by a 3-h hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp and a 2-h hyperglycemic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both AE and RE prevented the significant <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> that was observed in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with controls, significant reductions in total and visceral fat and intrahepatic <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> were observed in both exercise groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with controls, a significant improvement in insulin sensitivity (27%) was observed in the RE group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Collapsed across groups, changes in visceral fat were associated with changes in intrahepatic <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> (r = 0.72) and insulin sensitivity (r = -0.47) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both AE and RE alone are effective for reducing abdominal fat and intrahepatic <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> adolescent boys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RE but not AE is also associated with significant improvements in insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
