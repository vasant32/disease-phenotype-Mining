<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Although <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> are now widely used to treat type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, their mechanism of action remains largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They are <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> for the transcription factor PPARgamma, and in addition to their insulin-sensitising effects, they can promote adipogenesis and control gene expression in adipose tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have explored the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> on insulin-mediated induction of pivotal genes involved in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism and thermogenesis in brown fat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The genes studied were: (1) <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> lipase (lpl), which is involved in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> uptake; (2) hormone-sensitive lipase (hsl), which mobilises fatty acids from stored <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>; (3) fatty acid synthase (fas), which regulates de novo lipogenesis; and (4) the uncoupling proteins (ucp) 1 and 3, which control thermogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used fetal rat primary brown adipocytes cultured with insulin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> or both combined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Then, we studied gene expression by northern and western blotting, as well as 'run-on' and gel-shift assays to identify binding of potential transcription factors to the fas promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> for 24 h induced ucp-1, lpl and hsl gene expression and when <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> was combined with insulin a synergistic effect on lpl and ucp-3 mRNA expression was produced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These effects were consistent with increased LPL and HSL activities as well as respiration rates, mainly in response to exogenous <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> did not alter FAS <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> basal levels but prevented the induction elicited by insulin in a time- and dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Correspondingly diminished FAS protein levels and activity, as well as cellular <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> content, were observed, indicating an antilipogenic action of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> in brown adipocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> impaired insulin increase in the FAS transcription rate by antagonising insulin-induced binding of upstream stimulatory factors to the E-box consensus sequence in the FAS promoter and insulin-induced binding of activating protein-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">Rosiglitazone</z:chebi> prevents insulin-induced up-regulation of the main lipogenic enzyme but increases the expression of those enzymes involved in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> uptake and mobilisation, favouring fatty acid utilisation through uncoupled respiration </plain></SENT>
