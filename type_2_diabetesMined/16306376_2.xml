<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We characterized about 2.3 kb of the 5'-flanking region of human BTC gene and identified six polymorphisms (-2159A&gt;G, -1449G&gt;A, -1388C&gt;T, -279C&gt;A, -233G&gt;C, and -226A&gt;G) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The G allele in the -226A&gt;G polymorphism was more frequent in type 2 diabetic patients (n = 250) than in nondiabetic subjects (n = 254) (35.6% vs. 27.8%, P = 0.007), and the -2159G, -1449A, and -1388T alleles were in complete linkage disequilibrium with the -226G allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of the -279A and -233C alleles were low (7.0 and 2.0% in diabetic patients), and no significant differences were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the diabetic group, insulin secretion ability, assessed by the serum C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> response to intravenous glucagon stimulation, was lower in patients with the -226G allele (G/G, 2.96 +/- 0.16 ng/ml; G/A, 3.65 +/- 0.18 ng/ml; A/A, 3.99 +/- 0.16 ng/ml at 5 min after stimulation; P = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in vitro functional analyses indicated that both the -226G and the -233C alleles caused an approximately 50% decrease in the promoter activity, but no effects of the -2159A&gt;G, -1449G&gt;A, -1388C&gt;T, and -279C&gt;A polymorphisms were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the -226A/G polymorphism of the BTC gene may contribute to the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
