<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to verify whether the pro-inflammatory cytokine-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase response is a pathogenic mechanism in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in elderly Korean women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 1737 elderly subjects aged over 60 years participated in a population based study in Seoul, Korea (SWS Study 1999) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Amongst them, a total of 232 non-smoking and non-diabetic female subjects aged 60-89 years was randomly selected and compared with each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Higher serum high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) concentrations were shown in subjects with IGT than those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (median 1.2 versus 0.9, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a relationship between serum hs-CRP concentrations and many components of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 or TNF-alpha concentrations, however, were neither increased in subjects with IGT nor closely correlated with the components of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multiple regression analysis with stepwise selection method using hs-CRP as a dependent variable, it was found that white blood cell (WBC) counts, body mass index (BMI), fasting insulin, post-load 2h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, hematocrit and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> were significant independent variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our study confirms that increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase reaction is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> in elderly Korean women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the hypothesis that pro-inflammatory cytokine-induced systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> is an early metabolic defect prior to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, is not supported in our study of elderly Korean women </plain></SENT>
