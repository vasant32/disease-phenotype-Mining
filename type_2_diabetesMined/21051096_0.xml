<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During the mean (SD) follow-up period of 9.3 (3.4) years, 6896 non-insulin-treated patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at baseline have been examined to determine predictors of switches to insulin therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their treatment at the last clinic visit was compared with the initial visit treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean (SD) age of participants was 51.2 (10.3) years with a mean (SD) duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> of 5.8 (5.9) years at initial registration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The switch to insulin from non-insulin therapy was 2.5 (95% confidence interval 2.4, 2.6) (2.2 men and 2.7 women) per 100 patient-years based on 64,540 patient-years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using a Cox's proportional hazards model, younger age at diagnosis, female gender, higher BMI and HbA(1c) were significant predictors of switch to insulin treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These are the first estimate of switch to insulin from non-insulin therapy in Iran </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Younger age at diagnosis, female gender, higher BMI and HbA(1c) at registration were identified as predictors of switching to insulin </plain></SENT>
