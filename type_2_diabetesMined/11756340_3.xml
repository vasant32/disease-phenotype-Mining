<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The antihyperglycemic drug dimethylbiguanide (DMB, also known as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>) reduces the risk of cardiovascular complications in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, although the mechanism(s) involved are unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DMB reduces glycosylation-related protein cross-linking, a process similar to fibrin cross-linking catalyzed by activated factor XIII (FXIII) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate whether the cardioprotective effect of DMB could be related to effects on clot stabilization, we studied the effects of DMB on FXIII, thrombin activity, and cleavage of fibrin(ogen) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Activity of purified and plasma FXIII was inhibited by DMB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis by mass spectrometry and FXIII-coupled magnetic particles excluded binding of DMB to FXIII </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thrombin-induced cleavage of the activation <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> from FXIII was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner, as was fibrinopeptide cleavage from fibrinogen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ancrod-induced cleavage of fibrinopeptide A was not affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DMB <z:hpo ids='HP_0005542'>prolonged clotting time</z:hpo> of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fiber thickness and pore size of fibrin clots, measured by permeation experiments and visualized by scanning electron microscopy, decreased significantly with DMB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No interactions between DMB and the active site of thrombin were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Turbidity experiments demonstrated that DMB changed polymerization and lateral aggregation of protofibrils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that DMB interferes with FXIII activation and fibrin polymerization, but not only by binding to thrombin on a different location than the active site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In patients on DMB therapy, FXIII antigen and activity levels in vivo were reduced over a 12-week period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that part of the cardioprotective effect of DMB in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may be attributed to alterations in fibrin structure/function </plain></SENT>
