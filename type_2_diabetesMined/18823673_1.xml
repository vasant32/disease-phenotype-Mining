<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To explore the feasibility of withdrawal of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> medication in elderly patients with HbA1c&lt;or=6.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: HbA1c was measured in 98 patients with known <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in 17 nursing homes in Sweden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two subjects with HbA1c &lt;or=6.0% participated in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152128" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">drug withdrawal</z:e> study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After measuring plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> on 3 consecutive days, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> drugs were reduced, i.e. complete withdrawal of oral anti-diabetic drugs (OADs), complete insulin withdrawal when doses were &lt;or=20units/day and reduced by half in patients on more than 20units/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 31 episodes of plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &lt;or=4.4mmol/l, most of them nocturnal (n=17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean HbA1c was 5.2+/-0.4% compared to 7.1+/-1.6% in the non-intervention group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three months after the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> drug discontinuation, 24 patients (75%) remained in the intervention group and mean HbA1c was then 5.8.+/-0.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six months after baseline investigation mean HbA1c in the intervention group was 5.8+/-1.1% compared with 6.6+/-1.4% in the non-intervention group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Hypoglycaemic events are common among elderly patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The withdrawal of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> medication in elderly with tight glycaemic control is safe and may decrease the risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
