<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the annual incidence and clinical characteristics of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among school-aged children as detected by urine <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> screening from 1974 to 2002 in the Tokyo metropolitan area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In total, 8,812,356 school children were examined for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003076'>glucosuria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Morning urine was used for the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When the urine was positive for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test was carried out to confirm <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 232 students were identified to have type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall annual incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 2.63/100,000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The annual incidence after 1981 was significantly higher than that before 1980 (1.73 vs. 2.76/100,000, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The annual incidence was significantly higher for junior high school students compared with primary school students (0.78 vs. 6.43/100,000, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall male-to-female ratio of students with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 1.0:1.19 (P = 0.296), but it was 1.0:1.56 (P = 0.278) for primary school students </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall, 83.4% of children with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (&gt; or = 20% overweight) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, nonobese girls (&lt;20% overweight) with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> accounted for 23.0% of the patients, whereas markedly <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> boys (&gt; or = 40% overweight) accounted for 61.5% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The frequency of a family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in second- and first-degree relatives was 56.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed that the incidence of young people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> increased after 1981 in the Tokyo metropolitan area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The increase in the frequency of this disorder seemed to be strongly related to an increasing prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Age and genetic susceptibility may be associated with the occurrence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
