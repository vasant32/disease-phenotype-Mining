<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: QT dispersion (QTd) is a good prognostic marker in type 2 diabetic patients without previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diabetic patients with an attenuated decline in nocturnal blood pressure (non-dippers) have been shown to have increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e>, vascular events and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between diurnal blood pressure rhythm, QTd and microvascular complications in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cardiovascular autonomic function tests, 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and urinary albumin excretion measurements were performed in healthy controls (n = 25), normoalbuminuric (n = 34) and microalbuminuric (n = 23) type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>QTd was assessed manually from 12-lead surface electrocardiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with the controls, both normoalbuminuric and microalbuminuric diabetic patients had increased QTd (59.11 +/- 15.86; 60.27 +/- 17.95 vs. 40.48 +/- 10.92, p &lt; 0.001 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, diabetic patients had increased QTd regardless of the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0259749" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autonomic neuropathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, non-dipper diabetic patients had increased QTd compared with the controls and dipper diabetic patients (69.73 +/- 14.50 vs. 40.48 +/- 10.92; 47.84 +/- 9.62 ms, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a negative correlation between QTd and diurnal diastolic blood pressure change (r = -0.48, p &lt; 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> were found to have increased QT dispersion irrespective of the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271686" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic autonomic neuropathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, QT dispersion in dipper diabetic patients was similar to the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This finding might point out that attenuated decline of nocturnal blood pressure could be a more sensitive marker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0259749" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autonomic neuropathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
