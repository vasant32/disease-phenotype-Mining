<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Determine the serum levels of endogenous secretory receptor for advanced glycation end products (esRAGEs) in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI) and in control patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> but no MCI, and examine the relationship of esRAGE and MCI with other clinical factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 101 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were hospitalized in the Department of Endocrinology at Fujian Provincial Hospital between January 2010 and January 2011 were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 58 patients with MCI and 43 patients without MCI (control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of esRAGE were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other clinical parameters were also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Type 2 diabetic patients with MCI had a longer duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; elevated HbA(1c), total cholesterol (CHOL), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> (TG), intima-media thickness, C-reactive protein (CRP), and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (ba-PWV); and lower ankle brachial index (ABI) and esRAGE relative to the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among patients with MCI, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score was positively correlated with serum esRAGE but negatively correlated with CHOL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Spearman rank correlation analysis indicated that esRAGE was positively correlated with MoCA score and ABI but negatively correlated with ba-PWV, CHOL, TG, and CRP in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that esRAGE may be a potential protective factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, and MCI in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
