<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: For a prospective study, 4,974 patients with newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, aged 25-65 years, were recruited from 23 clinics around the U.K. between 1977 and 1991 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these subjects, 82% were white, 10% were South Asians, and 8% were Afro-Caribbeans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fatal and first nonfatal MIs were defined by criteria based on the World Health Organization's Multinational Study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Vascular Disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Age-standardized incidence rates were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cox regression was used to assess the independent effect of ethnicity controlling for risk factors for MI measured at study entry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the subjects, 295 had a fatal MI and 558 had a fatal or a first nonfatal MI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The age-standardized rate per 1,000 person years for fatal or nonfatal MI for whites was 14.6 (95% CI, 13.3-15.9), for Afro-Caribbeans 4.3 (2.5-7.0), and for South Asians 15.4 (10.6-21.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The hazard ratio associated with Afro-Caribbean ethnicity for MI relative to whites was 0.3 (0.2-0.6) after adjusting for age, sex, year of study entry, systolic blood pressure, smoking, social class, total cholesterol, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, whereas the hazard ratio for South Asians was 1.2 (0.9-1.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study found that after adjusting for conventional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, U.K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Afro-Caribbean subjects with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had a lower risk for MI than whites, whereas South Asians did not have a risk different from that of whites </plain></SENT>
