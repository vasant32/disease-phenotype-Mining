<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Health technology assessments (HTAs) aim to inform policy decision makers in their efforts to achieve more effective allocation of resources by providing evidence-based input on new technologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Within the hierarchy of evidence, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) remain the 'gold standard' used to inform HTAs, but are limited by poor external validity (ie, generalizability to real-world populations) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Unlike RCTs, observational studies are able to enrol broader patient populations, but their design renders such studies vulnerable to confounding factors and selection bias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, it is increasingly recognized that observational studies can complement RCTs by supporting and extending efficacy findings from RCTs to real-world clinical practice, particularly across geographical populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They can also provide locally relevant baseline and disease natural history data to populate health economic models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, observational data are likely to be of considerable informative value to policy makers in developing countries reaching decisions on <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care within an environment of scarce resources </plain></SENT>
