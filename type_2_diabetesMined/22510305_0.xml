<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the synergy between improved glycaemia and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> on BP reduction in patients treated with either exenatide twice daily (BID) or once weekly (QW) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Combining data from three controlled trials, 686 (53% male) patients [baseline mean ± SD: age 55 ± 10 years, weight 95 ± 20 kg, systolic blood pressure (SBP)/diastolic blood pressure (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi>) 130/79 ± 15/9 mmHg, HbA(1c) 8.3 ± 1.1%] treated with exenatide QW (n = 541) or BID (n = 145) were observed over 26 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using weighted means (WMs) of the longitudinal measures of HbA(1c) and weight, patients were subdivided into four groups at each visit by glycaemic and weight responses; patients who failed to reduce both HbA(1c) and weight below WMs became the reference group (R) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The other three groups corresponded to patients with HbA(1c) reduction (A), weight reduction (W) and both HbA(1c) and weight reduction (AW) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with R, patients in AW, A and W groups had a significantly higher likelihood of improving SBP &lt;130 mmHg by 88, 30 and 61%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with R, patients in AW, A and W had 63, 13 and 45% higher likelihood of improving <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> &lt;80 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although the mechanism of BP-lowering effect of exenatide is not established, it appears that the short-term dynamics of BP is related to concomitant effects on glycaemia and body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data offer a preliminary insight into the possible cardiometabolic effects of GLP-1 receptor agonism </plain></SENT>
