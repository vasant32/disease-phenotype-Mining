<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to assess during 7 years of follow-up the incidence rate of overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> and the predictive role of <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> and other baseline variables (blood pressure, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, fibrinogen, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi>, smoking, and HbA(1c) cumulative average during follow-up) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A prospective population-based study was performed in Casale Monferrato, Italy, including 1,253 type 2 diabetic patients recruited at baseline (1991-1992), 765 with normoalbuminuria (albumin excretion rate [AER] &lt;20 microg/min) and 488 with <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> (AER 20-200 microg/min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> measurements were centralized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A nested case-control study within the cohort was performed, selecting four control subjects, frequency matched for age and attained individual time of follow-up with each case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conditional regression analysis was performed to assess variables independently associated with risk of progression to overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 1,253 total patients, 1,103 (88.0%) were included in the follow-up examination (median 5.33 years); their age and duration of disease at baseline were 68.4 +/- 10.5 years and 10.4 +/- 6.6 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cases of overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> were 202, giving an incidence rate of 37.0/1,000 person-years (95% CI 32.3-42.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conditional logistic regression analyses, <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> provided a 42% increased risk with respect to normoalbuminuria (95% CI 0.98-2.06), independently of duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and systolic blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Other variables independently associated with progression to overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> were HbA(1c) cumulative average (P = 0.002), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B (P = 0.013), fibrinogen (P = 0.02), and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Of type 2 diabetic patients, 3.7% progress every year to overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>Microalbuminuria</z:mp> is associated with a 42% increased risk of progression to overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Other independent predictors are HbA(1c), <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B, and fibrinogen </plain></SENT>
