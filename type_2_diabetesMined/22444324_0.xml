<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aim of this study was to investigate differences in the outcome of patients with PDM and those with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>.In a retrospective study we evaluated 96 diabetic patients, who started hemodialysis (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>) in our dialysis centre (1997-2005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 12 patients PMD was diagnosed, and 84 patients had type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In both groups we compared vascular risk factors and prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular diseases</z:e> at the start of dialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also evaluated incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004395'>malnutrition</z:hpo>, and 5-year survival in both patient groups.The vascular risk factors were similar in both patient groups, also the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular diseases</z:e> at the initiation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> was similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the patients with PDM the mean BMI (kg/m2) was lower (22 + 3 versus 25 + 3), and also their serum albumin was lower (2.7 + 0.3 versus 3.4 + 0.3 g/dl, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four of these patients (33%) developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0004395'>malnutrition</z:hpo> (BMI &lt; 18.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the patients with PDM the age adjusted 5-year survival was significantly lower (8% versus 27%, p &lt; 0.05) than in the type 2 diabetic patients.Conclusions in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>-treated patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or PDM the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular diseases</z:e> was not significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The lower survival of PDM patients can be related to poor nutrition status </plain></SENT>
