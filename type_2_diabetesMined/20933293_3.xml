<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the level of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> awareness in Cameroonians, and to identify factors that influence this awareness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In subjects aged â‰¥ 25 years (n=1000, 93.4% of response), details regarding risk factors, symptoms, treatment and complications of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One mark was attributed to each true answer and a global <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> awareness score was computed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Influence of age, gender, educational level, occupational level, notion of a relative having a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> condition and presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disease were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighty percent of subjects scored more than the total mean score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The highest score obtained by participants (0.10%) was 28/30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean total score was higher in men (p &lt; 0.02) and in subjects with a relative having a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> condition (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analyses, age classes (p &lt; 0.01), educational level (p &lt; 0.001) and relatives with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> condition (p &lt; 0.001) were associated to the global <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> awareness score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> awareness was generally good </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This may be due to the fact that the study was conducted in an area where health promotion and health education on <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have been intensively delivered for the past 4 years </plain></SENT>
