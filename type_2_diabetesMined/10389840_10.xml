<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Membrane <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> plasma cell 1 (PC-1) has been shown to be increased in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> through inhibiting the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase, which was demonstrated using cultured <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, other reports have shown contradictory results in Chinese hamster ovary cells and in vitro kinase assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, we considered it necessary to investigate the effect of PC-1 using highly insulin-sensitive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we used two of the following approaches: 1) investigating PC-1 expression levels in insulin-responsive tissues in rat models of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 2) overexpressing PC-1 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that PC-1 was highly expressed in insulin-responsive tissues, such as liver and adipose tissue, in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, high-fat feeding or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi>-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> did not change its expression levels in liver, adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, PC-1 expression levels were not associated with high-fat-diet-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although PC-1 was increased in adipose tissue in <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> fatty rats (protein level, by 50%; <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level, by 90%), its expression levels in liver and skeletal muscle, tissues that are more responsible for whole body <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism than adipose tissue, did not significantly differ from those in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Next, we overexpressed PC-1 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes using an adenovirus transfection system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PC-1 expression was markedly increased to a level 16-fold greater than that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human adipose tissue, which is higher than the previously reported levels in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate 1, activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake were not affected by PC-1 overexpression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results strongly suggest that increased PC-1 expression is not causally related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
