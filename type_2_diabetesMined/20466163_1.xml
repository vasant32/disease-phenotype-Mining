<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fear of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> provides a major barrier to improving blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control as a result of delayed insulin initiation and failure to appropriately titrate insulin following initiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Modern insulin analogs were designed to achieve improved blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control with similar hypoglycemic risk compared with non-analog insulins (or similar blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control with reduced hypoglycemic risk) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While this has been demonstrated in randomized controlled trials, there is a need to confirm these findings in an everyday clinical setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The A(1)chieve study will evaluate adverse events and effectiveness of premix (biphasic insulin aspart 30 [NovoMix 30]), basal (insulin detemir [Levemir]), and meal-time (insulin aspart [NovoRapid]) insulin analogs in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in near-routine clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A(1)chieve is an international, prospective, multi-center, open-label, non-interventional, 24-week study of people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> using an insulin analog </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The study will recruit 60 000 people from 30 countries across four continents (Asia, Africa, South America, and Europe) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The primary aim of the study is to assess the adverse event profile of the study insulins in routine clinical practice, including rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, effectiveness (HbA(1c), fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and postprandial plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>) and patient quality of life outcomes will be measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Comprehensive epidemiological data will be collected at baseline, including recent plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> results and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001988'>hypoglycemic episodes</z:hpo>, prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related complications, and measures of current standards of care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, A(1)chieve should provide important information about how insulin analogs perform in daily clinical practice </plain></SENT>
