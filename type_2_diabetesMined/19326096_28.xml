<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When examined in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and individuals at increased risk, reductions in beta cell mass and abnormalities of beta cell function can both be demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The question of whether one alone is sufficient or both are necessary for the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> has been debated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on human and animal studies, it appears that neither alone is sufficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rather, for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> to rise to the level at which <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> would be diagnosed, defects in beta cell mass and in beta cell function are required </plain></SENT>
