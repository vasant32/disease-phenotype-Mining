<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Since over-nutrition accelerates the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, progression to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and the associated co-morbidity and mortality, there has been a keen interest in therapeutic interventions targeting mechanisms that may curb appetite, increase energy expenditure or at least attenuate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Over the past decade, numerous peri-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> targets in the de novo <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> synthesis pathway have been linked to an increase in energy expenditure and the drug development industry has pursued the gene products involved as candidates to develop drugs against </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The basis of this link, and specifically the premise that lowering tissue and cellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15531">malonyl-CoA</z:chebi> can increase energy expenditure, is scrutinised here </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The argument presented is that fuel switching as effected by changes in cellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15531">malonyl-CoA</z:chebi> concentrations will not trigger the mitochondria to increase energy expenditure because: (1) an increase in beta-oxidation by lowering respiratory exchange ratio (indicative of the metabolic fuel consumed) does not equal an increase in energy expenditure (how rapidly fuel is consumed); (2) the ATP:oxygen ratios (i.e. ATP energy made:oxygen required for the reaction) are similar when metabolising <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> (2.8) vs <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (3.0); (3) substrate availability (NEFA) does not drive energy expenditure in vivo; and (4) the availability of <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> matrix determines the rate of energy expenditure, not the availability of fuel to enter the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To increase <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> energy expenditure, work must be done (exercise) and/or the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> proton leak must be enhanced, both of which increase availability of <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In fact, despite the historic taboo of chemical uncoupling, this mechanism validated in humans is closest on task to increasing whole-body energy expenditure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Chemical uncoupling mimics the naturally occurring phenomenon of proton leak, accelerating the metabolism of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, it is completely non-genomic (i.e. the target is a location, not a gene product) and is not associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002555'>addiction</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100852'>mood alterations</z:hpo> common to satiety agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A significant hurdle for drug development is to discover a safe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> uncoupler and to formulate it potentially as a pro-drug and/or oral pump, to avoid the issue of overdosing experienced in the 1930s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The potential therapeutic impact of such a compound for an over-nutritioned patient population could be profound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>If effective, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> uncoupler mechanism could resolve many of the associated diseases such as type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnoea</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0400966" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">non-alcoholic steatohepatitis</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020473" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperlipidaemia</z:e>, therefore becoming a 'disease-modifying therapy' </plain></SENT>
