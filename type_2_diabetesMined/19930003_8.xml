<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Cinnamon has a long history as an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> spice, but trials involving cinnamon supplementation have produced contrasting results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this review was to examine the results of randomized controlled clinical trials of cinnamon and evaluate the therapeutic potential amongst patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and insulin-resistant patients, particularly the ability to reduce blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels and inhibit protein glycation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A systematic electronic literature search using the medical subject headings 'cinnamon' and 'blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>' was carried out to include randomized, placebo-controlled in vivo clinical trials using Cinnamomum verum or Cinnamomum cassia conducted between January 2003 and July 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five type 2 diabetic and three non-diabetic studies (total N = 311) were eligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two of the diabetic studies illustrated significant fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FBG) reductions of 18-29% and 10.3% (p &lt; 0.05), supported by one non-diabetic trial reporting an 8.4% FBG reduction (p &lt; 0.01) vs. placebo, and another illustrating significant reductions in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> response using oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three diabetic studies reported no significant results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Whilst definitive conclusions cannot be drawn regarding the use of cinnamon as an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> therapy, it does possess antihyperglycaemic properties and potential to reduce postprandial blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further research is required to confirm a possible correlation between baseline FBG and blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> reduction and to assess the potential to reduce pathogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> with cinnamon supplementation </plain></SENT>
