<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Exenatide is an incretin mimetic that activates glucagon-like-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It blunts the postprandial rise of plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> by increasing <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent insulin secretion, suppressing inappropriately high glucagon secretion and delaying gastric emptying </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In seven clinical trials performed in 2845 adult patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> who were inadequately controlled by a sulphonylurea and/or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (glycosylated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi>, HbA1c &lt;or=11%), or by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> (with or without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>) and treated for periods from 16 weeks to 3 years, exenatide (5 microg b.i.d. s.c. for the first 4 weeks of treatment and 10 microg b.i.d. s.c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>thereafter) reduced HbA1c, fasting and postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and body weight dose dependently, and was similar to insulin glargine and biphasic insulin aspart in reducing HbA1c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Body weight diminished with exenatide, whereas it increased with both insulin preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Positive effects on the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile and a reduction in C-reactive protein were also recorded with exenatide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment extensions up to 3 years showed that benefits were maintained in the long term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adverse events were usually mild to moderate in intensity, and generally the frequency decreased with continued therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most common was <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> (whose incidence may be reduced by gradual dose escalation from 5 microg b.i.d. to 10 microg b.i.d.), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, diarrhoea, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> (almost exclusively in patients treated with a sulphonylurea) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Exenatide is a new, promising therapeutic option for type 2 diabetic patients inadequately controlled by oral agents, before insulin therapy, offering the added benefits of body weight reduction and tight postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control </plain></SENT>
