<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo> is a major determinant of this increased risk and is a potential therapeutic target </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to establish the natural biological variation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The biological variation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> was assessed by measuring <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> at 4-day intervals on 10 consecutive occasions in 12 postmenopausal women with diet-controlled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and in 11 weight- and age-matched postmenopausal women without type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo> was derived using the homeostasis model assessment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-IR) method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The distribution of HOMA-IR was log Gaussian in the type 2 diabetic study group and Gaussian in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The HOMA-IR in the type 2 diabetic group was significantly greater than that of the control group (mean +/- SD: 4.33 +/- 2.3 vs. 2.11 +/- 0.79 units, P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After accounting for analytical variation, the mean intraindividual variation was also substantially greater in the type 2 diabetic group than in the control group (mean 1.05 vs. 0.15, P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Consequently, at any level of HOMA-IR, a subsequent sample must increase by &gt;90% or decrease by &gt;47% to be considered significantly different from the first </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: HOMA-IR is significantly greater and more variable for individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this inherent variability needs to be accounted for in studies evaluating therapeutic reduction of HOMA-IR in this group </plain></SENT>
