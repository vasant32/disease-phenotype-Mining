<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We identified 3331 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were newly treated with sulphonylureas between 1994 and 2001 and categorized them into those treated with only pancreatic-specific sulphonylureas and those treated with only non-specific sulphonylureas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The risks of mortality and cardiovascular mortality were compared in a survival analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 2914 patients treated with pancreatic-specific sulphonylureas only, of which 683 (23.4%) died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of 186 patients treated with non-specific drugs only, 40 (21.5%) died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for confounding factors, the adjusted risk ratios (with 95% CI) for mortality and cardiovascular mortality were 0.84 (0.61 to 1.17) and 0.81 (0.59 to 1.11) among the non-specific users compared with the pancreatic-specific users </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This provides no evidence that there are differences between the two sulphonylureas types </plain></SENT>
