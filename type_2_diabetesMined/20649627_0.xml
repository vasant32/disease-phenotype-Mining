<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 1271 (98.2%) of 1294 type 2 participants in the observational Fremantle <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study (mean age 64.2 years, 48.8% males) who had detailed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-specific therapy recorded at baseline and complete follow-up data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mortality and hospital discharge data were collected over 13 174 patient-years (mean +/- SD: 10.4 +/- 3.9 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards modelling was used to determine whether baseline <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treatments were independently associated with cardiovascular mortality, hospitalization for/<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality after adjustment for other explanatory variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During follow-up, 523 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred (41.1%) of which 269 (51.4%) were attributed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hospitalization for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> as principal diagnosis occurred at least once for 481 (37.8%) participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In Kaplan-Meier analyses, there were significant differences in cardiovascular mortality, hospitalization for/<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality between <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> therapy groups (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with diet and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy, those treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>-sulphonylurea had higher cardiovascular and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality (p &lt; or = 0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Insulin users had significantly higher cardiovascular mortality, hospitalization for/<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality than those on combination therapy (p &lt; or = 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for significant variables in the most parsimonious models, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treatment was not independently associated with any of the three study endpoints (p &gt; or = 0.49) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Combination <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>-sulphonylurea appears as safe as other blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering therapies used for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
