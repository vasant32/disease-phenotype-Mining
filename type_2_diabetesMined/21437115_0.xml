<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The advent of colesevelam in 2000 provided a more tolerable add-on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>-lowering agent with an excellent safety record and with likely benefit for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Colesevelam lowers <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> approximately 15%, and has an additive effect when combined with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> or non-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-modifying agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It also tends to increase <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The discovery that bile sequestrants also lower <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels led to definitive large-scale clinical trials testing the effect of colesevelam as a dual antihyperglycemic agent with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>-lowering properties in type 2 diabetic subjects on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>-, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi>- or insulin-based therapy with inadequate glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Colesevelam was found to lower <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA1c) by approximately 0.5% compared to placebo over the 16- to 26-week period, and had similar effects on the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile in these diabetic subjects, as had previously been demonstrated in non-diabetic individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Colesevelam was well tolerated, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002019'>constipation</z:hpo> being the most common adverse effect, and did not cause <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> or excessive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Colesevelam thus combines antihyperglycemic action with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>-lowering properties, and should be useful in the management of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
