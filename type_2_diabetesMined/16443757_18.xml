<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, a reduction in circulating FFAs may increase insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This could be achieved by increasing FFA reesterification in adipose tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transgenic mice with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009126'>increased adipose tissue</z:hpo> glyceroneogenesis, caused by overexpression of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18021">phosphoenolpyruvate</z:chebi> carboxykinase (PEPCK), show increased FFA reesterification and develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> but are insulin sensitive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we examined whether these transgenic mice were protected from diet-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, when fed a high-fat diet for a short period (6 weeks), transgenic mice developed severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and were more hyperinsulinemic, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> intolerant, and insulin resistant than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The high <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> accumulation prevented white adipose tissue from buffering the flux of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> in circulation and led to increased serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels and fat deposition in liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, circulating leptin and FFA concentrations increased to similar levels in transgenic and control mice, while adiponectin levels decreased in transgenic mice compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, transgenic mice showed fat accumulation in brown adipose tissue, which decreased uncoupling protein-1 expression, suggesting that these mice had impaired diet-induced thermogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that increased PEPCK expression in the presence of high-fat feeding may have deleterious effects and lead to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
