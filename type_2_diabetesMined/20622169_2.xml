<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The efficacy of liraglutide, a human glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) analog, to prevent or delay <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in UCD-T2DM rats, a model of polygenic <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: At 2 months of age, male rats were divided into three groups: control, food-restricted, and liraglutide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Animals received liraglutide (0.2 mg/kg s.c.) or vehicle injections twice daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Restricted rats were food restricted to equalize body weights to liraglutide-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Half of the animals were followed until <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, whereas the other half of the animals were killed at 6.5 months of age for tissue collection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Before <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> energy intake, body weight, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e>, and liver <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> content were higher in control animals compared with restricted and liraglutide-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Energy-restricted animals had lower food intake than liraglutide-treated animals to maintain the same body weights, suggesting that liraglutide increases energy expenditure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Liraglutide treatment delayed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> by 4.1 ± 0.8 months compared with control (P &lt; 0.0001) and by 1.3 ± 0.8 months compared with restricted animals (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Up to 6 months of age, energy restriction and liraglutide treatment lowered fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and A1C concentrations compared with control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, liraglutide-treated animals exhibited lower fasting plasma insulin, glucagon, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> compared with both control and restricted animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, energy-restricted and liraglutide-treated animals exhibited more <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> islet <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Liraglutide treatment delays the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in UCD-T2DM rats by reducing energy intake and body weight, and by improving insulin sensitivity, improving <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profiles, and maintaining islet <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
