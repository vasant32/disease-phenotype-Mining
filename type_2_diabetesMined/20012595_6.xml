<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Emerging evidence indicates that reversible phosphorylation regulates oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to identify and quantify site-specific phosphorylation of the catalytic beta subunit of ATP synthase (ATPsyn-beta) and determine protein abundance of ATPsyn-beta and other OxPhos components in skeletal muscle from healthy and insulin-resistant individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Skeletal muscle biopsies were obtained from lean, healthy, <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, non-diabetic and type 2 diabetic volunteers (each group n = 10) for immunoblotting of proteins, and hypothesis-driven identification and quantification of phosphorylation sites on ATPsyn-beta using targeted nanospray tandem mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Volunteers were metabolically characterised by euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven phosphorylation sites were identified on ATPsyn-beta purified from human skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>Obese</z:mp> individuals with and without type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were characterised by impaired insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal rates, and showed a approximately 30% higher phosphorylation of ATPsyn-beta at Tyr361 and Thr213 (within the nucleotide-binding region of ATP synthase) as well as a coordinated downregulation of ATPsyn-beta protein and other OxPhos components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020459" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Insulin increased</z:e> Tyr361 phosphorylation of ATPsyn-beta by approximately 50% in lean and healthy, but not insulin-resistant, individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These data demonstrate that ATPsyn-beta is phosphorylated at multiple sites in human skeletal muscle, and suggest that abnormal site-specific phosphorylation of ATPsyn-beta together with reduced content of OxPhos proteins contributes to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further characterisation of phosphorylation of ATPsyn-beta may offer novel targets of treatment in human diseases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction, such as <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
