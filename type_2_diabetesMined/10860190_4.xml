<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0002057'>Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>Microalbuminuria</z:mp>, Cardiovascular Events and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8774">Ramipril</z:chebi> (DIABHYCAR) Study was set up to address this issue through a multicenter double-blind parallel placebo-controlled &gt; or = 3-year trial in Europe and North Africa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this article, we report the characteristics of the randomized patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The main selection criteria were as follows: men or women aged &gt; or = 50 years with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treated with oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs, with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, with a plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> level &lt; 150 mumol/l, and with persistent micro- or macroalbuminuria, as assessed centrally by two successive urine samples containing a urinary albumin concentration &gt; or = 20 mg/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patient characteristics were studied by comparing patients who were randomized to those who were not, taking their geographical origin into account </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 25,455 patients screened for urinary albumin (20,296 from France, 918 from Germany, 1,019 from Northwest Europe, 969 from Central Europe, 959 from Mediterranean Europe, and 1,294 from North Africa) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, 4,937 were randomized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with the nonrandomized patients, the randomized patients were older, more often men, more <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, had higher systolic/diastolic blood pressure and plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, smoked more tobacco, drank more alcohol, and had complications more frequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using a logistic regression analysis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the above-mentioned items appeared as independent determinants for randomization into the study, with the exception of alcohol intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The contribution of each item varied slightly from one geographical origin to another </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The physical, biological, and behavioral characteristics create a poor renal and cardiovascular prognosis for the type 2 diabetic patients randomized to the DIABHYCAR Study because of micro- and macroalbuminuria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Testing the usefulness of ACE inhibition for the type 2 diabetic patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> seems feasible through the DIABHYCAR Study </plain></SENT>
