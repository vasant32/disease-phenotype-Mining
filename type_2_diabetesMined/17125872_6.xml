<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> DNA (mtDNA) are associated with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) because ATP plays a critical role in the production and the release of insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To systematically determine mutant loci and to investigate their association with T2DM in Chinese Han population, 17 commonly reported mutant loci were screened in 236 cases of T2DM and 240 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls by PCR-RFLP, allele-specific PCR (AS-PCR) and DNA sequencing methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Biological softwares were used to analyze the secondary structure of DNA, <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and the corresponding proteins for missense mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixteen mutant loci were detected in total, of which five were novel, GenBank accession nos. were DQ092356, DQ473644 and DQ473645; they were mainly in16S rRNA, ND1 and ND4 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was significant difference between the two groups for ND1 and ND4 genes mutation frequencies (ND1: P=0.001, OR=3.944, 95% CI 1.671-9.306; ND4: P=0.010, OR=5.818, 95% CI 1.275-26.537) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant association was observed between the two groups for 5178A/C polymorphisms (P=0.418) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our study suggested that T3394C and A12026G might be associated with T2DM in Chinese Han population, and T2DM with mtDNA variant should be considered <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
