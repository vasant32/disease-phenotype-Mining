<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals, central <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> can be tolerated for many years without development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we examine longitudinally the mechanisms by which <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance can be maintained in the face of substantial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> dogs were fed a diet enriched with moderate amounts of fat (2 g x kg(-1) x day(-1)), similar to that seen in modern "cafeteria" diets, and the time course of metabolic changes in these animals was examined over 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Trunk <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging increased from 12 to 19%, but body weight remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity (SI) as determined by frequently sampled intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests was measured over a 12-week period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SI decreased 35% by week 1 and remained impaired for the entire 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance was reduced transiently for 1 week, recovered to baseline, and then again began to decline after 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>First-phase insulin response began to increase after week 2, peaked by week 6 (190% of basal), and then declined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The increase in insulin response was due partially to enhanced beta-cell function (22%) but due also to an approximately 50% reduction in insulin clearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This compensation by insulin clearance was also confirmed with insulin clamps performed in fat-fed versus control dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The present study confirms the ability of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individual to compensate for fat-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> by enhanced insulin response, such that the product of insulin sensitivity x secretion is little changed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, the compensation is due as much to reduced insulin clearance as increased beta-cell sensitivity to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Reduced hepatic extraction of insulin may be the first line of defense providing a higher proportion of secreted insulin to the periphery and sparing the beta-cells during compensation for the insulin-resistant state </plain></SENT>
