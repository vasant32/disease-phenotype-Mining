<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Clinical trials have demonstrated that lifestyle changes can prevent type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but the importance of leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) is still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We carried out post hoc analyses on the role of LTPA in preventing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in 487 men and women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> who had completed 12-month LTPA questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The subjects were participants in the Finnish <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Prevention Study, a randomized controlled trial of lifestyle changes including diet, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, and LTPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 107 new cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during the 4.1-year follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Individuals who increased moderate-to-vigorous LTPA or strenuous, structured LTPA the most were 63-65% less likely to develop <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adjustment for changes in diet and body weight during the study attenuated the association somewhat (upper versus lower third: moderate-to-vigorous LTPA, relative risk 0.51, 95% CI 0.26-0.97; strenuous, structured LTPA, 0.63, 0.35-1.13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Low-intensity and lifestyle LTPA and walking also conferred benefits, consistent with the finding that the change in total LTPA (upper versus lower third: 0.34, 0.19-0.62) was the most strongly associated with incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus increasing physical activity may substantially reduce the incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in high-risk individuals </plain></SENT>
