<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> is associated with a state of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> low-grade <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> mediated by immune cells that are primarily located to adipose tissue and liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> appears to underlie <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-induced metabolic deterioration including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Osteopontin (OPN) is an inflammatory cytokine, the expression of which is strongly upregulated in adipose tissue and liver upon <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we studied OPN effects in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> by targeting OPN action in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat diet to induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and were then intravenously treated with an OPN-neutralizing or control antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity and inflammatory alterations in adipose tissue and liver were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Interference with OPN action by a neutralizing antibody for 5 days significantly improved insulin sensitivity in diet-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Anti-OPN treatment attenuated liver and adipose tissue macrophage infiltration and inflammatory gene expression by increasing macrophage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and significantly reducing c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we report OPN as a novel negative regulator for the activation of hepatic signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), which is essential for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis and insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Consequently, OPN neutralization decreased expression of hepatic gluconeogenic markers, which are targets of STAT3-mediated downregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that antibody-mediated neutralization of OPN action significantly reduces <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>OPN neutralization partially decreases <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in adipose tissue and liver and reverses signal transduction related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Hence, targeting OPN could provide a novel approach for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
