<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested whether GCKR variability affects type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or kidney-related phenotypes in newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In 509 GAD-negative patients with newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we 1) genotyped six single nucleotide polymorphisms in GCKR genomic region: rs6717980, rs1049817, rs6547626, rs780094, rs2384628, and rs8731; 2) assessed clinical phenotypes, insulin sensitivity by the euglycemic insulin clamp, and β-cell function by state-of-the-art modeling of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>/C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> curves during an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test; and 3) estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by the Modification of Diet in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Renal Disease</z:e> formula </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The major alleles of rs6717980 and rs2384628 were associated with reduced β-cell function (P &lt; 0.05), with mutual additive effects of each variant (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The minor alleles of rs1049817 and rs6547626 and the major allele of rs780094 were associated with reduced eGFR according to a recessive model (P &lt; 0.03), but with no mutual additive effects of the variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additional associations were found between rs780094 and 2-h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.05) and rs8731 and insulin sensitivity (P &lt; 0.05) and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings are compatible with the idea that GCKR variability may play a pathogenetic role in both type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and CKD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Genotyping GCKR in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> might help in identifying patients at high risk for metabolic derangements or CKD </plain></SENT>
