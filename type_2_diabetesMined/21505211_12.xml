<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study (2004-2008) of 71,092 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, aged ≥60 years, enrolled in Kaiser Permanente Northern California </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We specified Cox proportional hazards models to evaluate the relationships between baseline glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (A1C) and subsequent outcomes (nonfatal complications [<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> metabolic, microvascular, and cardiovascular events] and mortality) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The cohort (aged 71.0 ± 7.4 years [means ± SD]) had a mean A1C of 7.0 ± 1.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The risk of any nonfatal complication rose monotonically for levels of A1C &gt;6.0% (e.g., adjusted hazard ratio 1.09 [95% CI 1.02-1.16] for A1C 6.0-6.9% and 1.86 [1.63-2.13] for A1C ≥11.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mortality had a U-shaped relationship with A1C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with the risk with A1C &lt;6.0%, mortality risk was lower for A1C levels between 6.0 and 9.0% (e.g., 0.83 [0.76-0.90] for A1C 7.0-7.9%) and higher at A1C ≥11.0% (1.31 [1.09-1.57]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Risk of any end point (complication or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>) became significantly higher at A1C ≥8.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patterns generally were consistent across age-groups (60-69, 70-79, and ≥80 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Observed relationships between A1C and combined end points support setting a target of A1C &lt;8.0% for older patients, with the caution that A1Cs &lt;6.0% were associated with increased mortality risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Additional research is needed to evaluate the low A1C-mortality relationship, as well as protocols for individualizing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care </plain></SENT>
