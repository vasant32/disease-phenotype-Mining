<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Seventeen type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in 1,268 Hispanic- and 581 African-American participants from the IRAS-FS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SNPs were tested for association with quantitative measures of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis, including insulin sensitivity index (S(I)), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin response (AIR), and disposition index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Previously identified risk variants in cyclin-dependent kinase 5 regulatory subunit associated protein 1-like 1 (CDKAL1) were associated with reduced AIR (P &lt; 0.0046) in Hispanic Americans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally in Hispanic Americans, the variant in a hypothetical gene (chromosome 11; LOC387761) was significantly associated with AIR (P = 0.0046) with the risk allele showing protective effects, i.e., increased AIR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In both Hispanic- and African-American populations, risk variants at the solute carrier family 30, member 8 (SLC30A8) locus were nominally associated with decreased disposition index (P &lt; 0.078) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Risk variants in the insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 2 (IGF2BP2) locus were associated with a decreased disposition index (P = 0.011) exclusively in Hispanic Americans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate a distinct, limited number of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related genes, more specifically the SNPs in the genes identified in European-derived populations, with modest evidence for association with <z:mp ids='MP_0002611'>glucose homeostasis traits</z:mp> in Hispanic Americans and African Americans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We observe evidence that <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk for CDKAL1, SLC30A8, IGF2BP2, and LOC387761 is specifically mediated through defects in insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms of other predisposing genes remain to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
