<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thiazolidinedione (TZD) trials using surrogate outcomes to postulate an antiatherogenic paradigm have been criticised as misinformative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted an independent systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled TZD studies incorporating carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) or pulse wave velocity (PWV) as primary outcome measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim was to provide an evidence-based overview of TZD intervention studies using markers prospectively linked to vascular outcome in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Systematic search of known databases for TZD intervention trials using mean thickness CIMT(n = 9) and ankle-brachial PWV(n = 6) as primary outcome measures was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CIMT and PWV pooled weighted mean difference was calculated using a random effects model accounting for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> and publication bias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An indirect meta-analysis provided a comparison of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A composite of combined placebo and comparator controlled trials demonstrated a significant weighted mean difference of-0.06 mm for CIMT (95% CI-0.09 to-0.02, p = 0.001) and-0.72 ms(-1) for PWV (95% CI-1.28 to-0.16, p = 0.011) in favour of thiazolidiendione treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No TZD intraclass variation in CIMT (p = 0.96) or PWV (p = 0.33) change was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: TZDs exhibit significant beneficial effects on aorto-carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> when assessed using prospectively validated non-invasive techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Inferring clinical benefit in the absence of confirmatory outcome trials is questionable and caution should be exercised when interpreting intervention data with surrogate endpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>TZD-induced congestive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> or other unknown PPAR-gamma adverse effects are plausible explanations for the conflicting results of intervention trials using markers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and clinical event outcomes </plain></SENT>
