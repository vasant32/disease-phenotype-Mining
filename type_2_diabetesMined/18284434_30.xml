<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To compare the efficacy and tolerability of vildagliptin vs. placebo in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) who are inadequately controlled [<z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c) (HbA(1c)) 7.5 to 11%] with prior sulphonylurea (SU) monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This 24-week, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study assessed the effects of the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor vildagliptin (50 mg given once or twice daily) vs. placebo added to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> (4 mg once daily) in 515 patients with T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adjusted mean changes from baseline to end-point (AMDelta) in HbA(1c), fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, fasting <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and body weight were compared by analysis of covariance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The between-group difference (vildagliptin - placebo) in AMDelta HbA(1c) was -0.6 +/- 0.1% in patients receiving vildagliptin 50 mg daily and -0.7 +/- 0.1% in those receiving 100 mg daily (p &lt; 0.001 vs. placebo for both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Greater efficacy was seen in patients &gt; or =65 years of age (-0.7 +/- 0.1% and -0.8 +/- 0.2% for 50 and 100 mg daily respectively) and in patients with baseline HbA(1c) &gt; 9% (Delta = -1.0 +/- 0.2% and -0.9 +/- 0.2% for 50 and 100 mg daily respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Relative to placebo, patients receiving vildagliptin also had improvements in beta-cell function and postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, with small changes in fasting <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidences of adverse events (AEs) (67.1, 66.3 and 64.2%) and serious AEs (2.9, 2.4 and 5.1%) were similar in patients receiving 50 mg vildagliptin, 100 mg vildagliptin or placebo respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of hypoglycaemic events was low but slightly higher in the group receiving vildagliptin 100 mg (3.6%) than in the group receiving vildagliptin 50 mg (1.2%) or placebo (0.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with T2DM inadequately controlled with prior SU monotherapy, addition of vildagliptin (50 or 100 mg daily) to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> (4 mg once daily) improves glycaemic control and is well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Addition of vildagliptin 50 mg daily to SU monotherapy may be a particularly attractive therapy in elderly patients </plain></SENT>
