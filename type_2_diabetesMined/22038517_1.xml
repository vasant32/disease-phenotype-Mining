<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were identified as being non-proteinuric using multiple urinalyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cases (n = 44) with low eGFR and controls (n = 46) had eGFR values &lt;60 and ≥60 ml min(-1) 1.73 m(-2), respectively, as calculated using the Modification of Diet in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Renal Disease</z:e> formula </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Urine samples were analysed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) and GC/MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>False discovery rates were used to adjust for multiple hypotheses testing, and selection of metabolites that best predicted low eGFR status was achieved using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eleven GC/MS metabolites were strongly associated with low eGFR after correction for multiple hypotheses testing (smallest adjusted p value = 2.62 × 10(-14), largest adjusted p value = 3.84 × 10(-2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In regression analysis, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37868">octanol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16995">oxalic acid</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="26078">phosphoric acid</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28179">benzamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, 3,5-dimethoxymandelic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29337,32988">amide</z:chebi> and N-acetylglutamine were selected as the best subset for prediction and allowed excellent classification of low eGFR (AUC = 0.996) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In LC/MS, 19 metabolites remained significant after multiple hypotheses testing had been taken into account (smallest adjusted p value = 2.04 × 10(-4), largest adjusted p value = 4.48 × 10(-2)), and several metabolites showed stronger evidence of association relative to the uraemic toxin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17840">indoxyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="100" ids="16189">sulphate</z:chebi> (adjusted p value = 3.03 × 10(-2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The potential effect of confounding on the association between metabolites was excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our study has yielded substantial new insight into low eGFR and provided a collection of potential urinary biomarkers for its detection </plain></SENT>
