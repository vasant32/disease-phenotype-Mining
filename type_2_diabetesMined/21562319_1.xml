<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This prospective cohort study in Tasmania, Australia, analyzed 458 adults with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance and a mean (SD) age of 49.7 (12.1) years in 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Variables assessed in 2000 and 2005 included PA, by pedometer and questionnaire, nutrient intake, and other lifestyle factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Incident dysglycemia was defined as the development of impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> revealed by oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance testing in 2005, without type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Incident dysglycemia developed in 26 participants during the 5-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Higher daily steps in 2000 were independently associated with a lower 5-year risk of incident dysglycemia (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.87 [95% CI 0.77-0.97] per 1,000-step increment) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Higher daily steps in 2005, after controlling for baseline steps in 2000 (thus reflecting change in steps over 5 years), were not associated with incident dysglycemia (AOR 1.02 [0.92-1.14]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Higher daily steps in 2000 were also associated with lower fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, but not 2-h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> by 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further adjustment for BMI or waist circumference did not remove these associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among community-dwelling adults, a higher rate of daily steps is associated with a reduced risk of incident dysglycemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This effect appears to be not fully mediated through reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> </plain></SENT>
