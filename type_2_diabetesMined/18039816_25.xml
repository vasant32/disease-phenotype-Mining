<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: In recent genome-wide association studies, two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near the HHEX locus were shown to be more frequent in type 2 diabetic patients than in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on HHEX's function during embryonic development of the ventral pancreas in mice, we investigated whether these SNPs affect beta-cell function in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 854 nondiabetic subjects, collected from five European clinical centers, were genotyped for the HHEX SNPs rs1111875 and rs7923837 and thoroughly characterized by an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To assess <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin release, a subgroup of 758 subjects underwent an intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (IVGTT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SNPs rs1111875 and rs7923837 were not associated with anthropometric data (age, weight, height, BMI, body fat, and waist and hip circumference) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for center, family relationship, sex, age, and BMI, both SNPs were also not associated with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin concentrations in the fasting state and during the OGTT or with measures of insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, HHEX SNP rs1111875 was not associated with insulin release during the IVGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By contrast, the minor A-allele of HHEX SNP rs7923837 was significantly associated with higher IVGTT-derived first-phase insulin release before and after appropriate adjustment (P = 0.013 and P = 0.014, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A common genetic variation in the 3'-flanking region of the HHEX locus, i.e., SNP rs7923837, is associated with altered <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This SNP's major allele represents a risk allele for <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta-cell dysfunction</z:hpo> and, thus, might confer increased susceptibility of beta-cells toward adverse environmental factors </plain></SENT>
