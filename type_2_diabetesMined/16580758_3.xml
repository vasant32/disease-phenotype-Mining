<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the association of dyslipedemia with micro and macro vascular complications of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Population based cross sectional study included 4067 diabetic patients who visited hospital during January 2000 to December 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">Lipid</z:chebi> profile was estimated by semi autoanalyser, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>Retinopathy</z:hpo> was assessed by fundoscopy, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>Nephropathy</z:hpo> by microalbuminurea, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD) by electro cardiogram (ECG) changes, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo> (PVD) by doppler study and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> by clinical examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The association of dyslipedemia with micro and macro vascular complications was assessed by regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of dyslipedemia is high in diabetic population with high serum cholesterol &gt;240mg/dl was seen in 15%, serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> &gt;160mg/dl was seen in 42.41%, raised <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> &gt;130mg/dl in 45.26%, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi> &gt;40mg/dl in 24.09% and low levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> &lt;40mg/dl were seen in 52.27% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On regression analysis, CAD had strong correlation with high levels of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi> (0.76), <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (0.82), <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> (0.23) and low <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> (-0.81) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similar association was seen with PVD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> were found to have significant correlation with low <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> (-0.43) and raised <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> (0.37), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Neuropathy</z:e> was not found to have any significant correlation with <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">Lipid</z:chebi> profile abnormalities are very common in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and it has great influence on CAD and PVD </plain></SENT>
