<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diabetic individuals are at increased risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0003233'>prolonged QT interval</z:mp> and SCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to replicate the finding that genetic variants in the nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase 1 adaptor protein (NOS1AP) gene are associated with QT interval duration in a type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-enriched sample of European ancestry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in NOS1AP were genotyped in 624 European Americans and 127 African Americans from 400 pedigrees enriched for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An additive genetic model was tested for each SNP in ancestry-specific analyses in the total sample and the diabetic subset (European Americans, n = 514; African Americans, n = 115), excluding from the analyses individuals taking QT-altering medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In European Americans, rs10494366 minor homozygotes had a 9.3-ms-longer QT interval compared with major homozygotes (P = 5.7 x 10(-5)); rs10918594 minor homozygotes had a 12.5-ms-longer QT interval compared with major homozygotes (P = 1.5 x 10(-6)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Restricting analyses to the diabetic European Americans strengthened the effect despite the reduction in sample size (11.3-ms difference, P = 5.1 x 10(-5); 13.9-ms difference, P = 1.6 x 10(-6), respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No association between the NOS1AP SNPs and QT interval duration was observed in the limited number of African Americans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Two NOS1AP SNPs are strongly associated with QT interval duration in a predominately diabetic European-American sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Stronger effects of NOS1AP variants in diabetic individuals suggest that this patient subset may be particularly susceptible to genetic variants that influence myocardial depolarization and repolarization as manifest in the QT interval </plain></SENT>
