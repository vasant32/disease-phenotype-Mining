<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rare mutations of HNF1alpha cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0004904'>maturity-onset diabetes of the young</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A common variant, G319S, private to the Oji-Cree population, predisposes to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but the role of common HNF1alpha variation in European populations has not been comprehensively assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We determined the linkage disequilibrium and haplotype structure across the HNF1alpha gene region using 29 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight tagging SNPs (tSNPs) that efficiently capture common haplotypes and the amino acid-changing variant, A98V, were genotyped in 5,307 subjects (2,010 type 2 diabetic case subjects, 1,643 control subjects, and 1,654 members of 521 families) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We did not find any evidence of association between the tSNPs or haplotypes and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We could exclude odds ratios (ORs) &gt;1.25 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tSNPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rare V98 allele (approximately 3% frequency) showed possible evidence of association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (OR 1.23 [95% CI 0.99-1.54], P = 0.07), a result that was supported by meta-analysis of this and published studies (OR 1.31 [1.08-1.59], P = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further studies are required to investigate this association, demonstrating the difficulty of defining the role of rare (&lt;5%) alleles in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
