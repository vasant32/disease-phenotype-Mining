<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 131 patients were treated in an open-label, randomized, multicenter study with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (45 mg o.d.) during a course of &gt;or=26 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Response to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> therapy was defined by either a &gt;20% decrease in fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> or a &gt;15% decrease in HbA(1c) values after 26 weeks of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the association between the PPAR-gamma genotype and the response rate to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The Pro12Ala and the Pro12Pro variants in the PPAR-gamma gene are not associated with the response rate to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> treatment in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, we identified initial fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level &gt;11.0 mmol/l, HbA(1c) value &gt;9.0%, BMI &gt;32 kg/m(2), and fasting C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> concentrations at baseline &gt;2.5 pmol/l as predominant confounding factors for the responder frequency to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The Pro12Ala variant in the PPAR-gamma gene does not affect the therapy efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>, suggesting that the drug-treatment response is independent from pharmacogenetic effects between PPAR-gamma and its ligand <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Whether the Ala12Ala genotype plays a role in the response rate to TZD therapy remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
