<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using the rat isolated-perfused pancreas, we investigated the inhibitory effect of miniglucagon on insulin secretion and evaluated the existence of an inhibitory tone exerted by this <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> inside the islet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Miniglucagon dose-dependently inhibited insulin secretion stimulated by 8.3 mol/l <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, with no change in the perfusion flow rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A concentration of 1 nmol/l miniglucagon had a significant inhibitory effect on a 1 nmol/l glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> 1 (7-36) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29337,32988">amide</z:chebi>-potentiated insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A decrease in extracellular <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration simultaneously stimulated glucagon and miniglucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using confocal and electron microscopy analysis, we observed that miniglucagon is colocalized with glucagon in mature secretory granules of alpha-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Perfusion of an anti-miniglucagon antiserum directed against the biologically active moiety of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> resulted in a more pronounced effect of a <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> challenge on insulin secretion, indicating that miniglucagon exerts a local inhibitory tone on beta-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We concluded that miniglucagon is a novel local regulator of the pancreatic islet <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> and that any abnormal inhibitory tone exerted by this <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> on the beta-cell would result in an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948379" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">impaired insulin secretion</z:e>, as observed in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
