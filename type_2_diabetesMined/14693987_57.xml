<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Epidemiological studies suggest that moderate alcohol consumers have enhanced insulin sensitivity and a reduced risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adiponectin, an adipocyte-derived plasma protein, has been found to be negatively associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> and positively associated with insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moderate alcohol consumption may increase adiponectin, which in turn causes a decrease of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF)-alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A decreased TNF-alpha level may consequently increase insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: To test this hypothesis, we performed a randomized crossover partially diet-controlled study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 23 healthy middle-aged male subjects consumed daily four glasses of whisky (40 g <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi>) or tap water with dinner during two successive periods of 17 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Moderate alcohol consumption increased plasma adiponectin level (11%; P = 0.0002) but did not affect plasma TNF-alpha level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An increase in insulin sensitivity index was observed in an insulin-resistant subgroup (21%; P = 0.11), which positively correlated with the relative alcohol-induced increase in plasma adiponectin level (r = 0.73, P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The experimental results are in agreement with observational data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moderate alcohol consumption improved insulin sensitivity in relatively insulin-resistant middle-aged men, an effect that may be mediated through alcohol-induced increases in adiponectin </plain></SENT>
