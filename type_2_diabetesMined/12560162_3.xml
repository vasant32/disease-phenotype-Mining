<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>Hyperglycemia</z:hpo> could be an alternative explanation for the association between type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since previous studies have been mostly lacking coronary angiographic data, we analyzed the relationship between the presence and severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004929'>coronary atherosclerosis</z:hpo> based on angiography and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two hundred and thirty subjects underwent coronary angiography and a 75-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Age, sex, waist-to-hip ratio, postchallenge 1-h and 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> levels were different between those with or without CAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, there was no significant difference in the plasma insulin levels, area of insulin under the curve, and the ratio of the insulin- and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> areas between the groups with and without CAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analysis including fasting-, 1-h, and 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> values and a variety of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> risk factors showed that age, sex and postchallenge 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were independent determinants of the presence of CAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0004929'>coronary atherosclerosis</z:hpo> might be associated with postchallenge <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, but not with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> in Korean subjects </plain></SENT>
