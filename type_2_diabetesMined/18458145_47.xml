<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study tested the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>-lowering agent colesevelam HCl (colesevelam) as a potential novel treatment for improving glycemic control in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi>-based therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A 26-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study was carried out between August 2004 and August 2006 to evaluate the efficacy and safety of colesevelam for reducing A1C in adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> whose glycemic control was inadequate (A1C 7.5-9.5%) with existing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> monotherapy or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> in combination with additional oral antidiabetes agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In total, 461 patients were randomized (230 given colesevelam 3.75 g/day and 231 given placebo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary efficacy measurement was mean placebo-corrected change in A1C from baseline to week 26 in the intent-to-treat population (last observation carried forward) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The least squares (LS) mean change in A1C from baseline to week 26 was -0.32% in the colesevelam group and +0.23% in the placebo group, resulting in a treatment difference of -0.54% (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The LS mean percent change in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> from baseline to week 26 was -16.1% in the colesevelam group and +0.6% in the placebo group, resulting in a treatment difference of -16.7% (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, significant reductions in fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24103">fructosamine</z:chebi>, total cholesterol, non-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B were demonstrated in the colesevelam relative to placebo group at week 26 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Colesevelam improved glycemic control and reduced <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> levels in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi>-based therapy </plain></SENT>
