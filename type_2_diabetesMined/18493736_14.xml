<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we hypothesized that TCF7L2 also contributed to genetic susceptibility for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a Chinese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We looked for new variants by direct sequencing of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> exons and intron-exon junctions of TCF7L2 in 100 Chinese type 2 diabetic patients, and then we genotyped five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) by Snapshot technology in 1,000 Chinese individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: By sequencing, we identified six SNPs (c.1,637C&gt;A; c.1,674C&gt;G; c.1,709G&gt;A; c.1,846C&gt;G; c.1,888C&gt;T; and c.1,876T&gt;G), and three of them led to non-synonymous polymorphisms (c.1,637C&gt;A, His--&gt;Gln or Pro--&gt;Thr; c.1,674C&gt;G, Pro--&gt;Arg; and c.1,709G&gt;A, Ala--&gt;Thr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of them are rare except c.1,637C&gt;A, which had a frequency of 0.23 for the minor A allele in 98 sequenced individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a case-control study, one of the newly discovered SNPs (c.1,637C&gt;A), together with four reported ones (rs7903146, rs12255372, rs290487 and rs3814573) were genotyped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparison between allele and genotype frequencies of these SNPs in patients and controls showed marginal association for rs7903146 and rs290487 with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (p = 0.063, OR 1.982, 95% CI 1.128-3.485; p = 0.071, OR 1.237, 95% CI 0.983-1.557, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No association was found for rs12255372, rs3814573, c.1,637C&gt;A and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (p = 0.278-1.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: With the current sample size, we did not find any mutation in the coding sequence of TCF7L2 that confers a genetic risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a Chinese population, and did not replicate some of the major positive results obtained in other populations </plain></SENT>
