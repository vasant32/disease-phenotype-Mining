<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We have previously observed that genetic profiles determined by the combination of five functionally significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs1800795, rs5498, rs5361, rs1024611, and rs679620) of genes encoding prototypical inflammatory molecules are associated with history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we tested the ability of this multigenic model to predict <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk in a large population-based prospective cohort of subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This study was conducted using a prospective cohort of individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> participating in the Go-DARTS (Genetics of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Audit and Research in Tayside Scotland) study, which includes genetic and clinical information of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> within the Tayside region of Scotland, U.K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The above-mentioned inflammatory SNPs were investigated in 2,182 Go-DARTS participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We created an inflammatory risk score (IRS), ranging from 0 to 5, according to the number of "at-risk" genotypes concomitantly carried by a given individual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was the occurrence of fatal or nonfatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of any kind </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up time was 6.2 Â± 1.1 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> increased according to the IRS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The IRS was significantly and independently associated with increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk after adjustment for other conventional risk factors (hazard ratio 1.34 [95% CI 1.1-1.7]; P = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The highest hazard ratio for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was found in subjects concomitantly carrying &gt; 3 proinflammatory variations and in subjects without previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This large prospective cohort study provides evidence that SNPs of genes encoding prototypical inflammatory molecules may be used to create multigenic models that predict <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
