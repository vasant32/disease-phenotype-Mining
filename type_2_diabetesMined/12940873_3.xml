<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The subjects were 104 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020473" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperlipidaemia</z:e>, and the difference, due to apo E genotype, in dietary response was followed for 4-6 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The caloric intake was maintained in the range 20-25 kcal/kg, and the medications for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were not changed during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
