<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed 14 SNPs at HHEX, CDKAL1, CDKN2B, SLC30A8, KCNJ11, IGF2BP2, PPARG, TCF7L2, FTO, KCNQ1, IRS-1, GCKR, UBE2E2, and C2CD4A/B in 1,487 Japanese individuals (724 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 763 control subjects) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A GRS was calculated according to the number of risk alleles by counting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 14 SNPs (T-GRS) as well as 11 SNPs related to β-cell function (β-GRS) and then assessing the association between each GRS and the clinical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 14 SNPs, 4 SNPs were significantly associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the present Japanese sample (P &lt; 0.0036) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The T-GRS was significantly associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P = 5.9 × 10(-21)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the β-GRS was associated with individuals receiving insulin therapy (β = 0.0131, SE = 0.006, P = 0.0431), age at diagnosis (β = -0.608, SE = 0.204, P = 0.0029), fasting serum C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> level (β = -0.032, SE = 0.0140, P = 0.022), and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> index (β = -0.031, SE = 0.012, P = 0.0125) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the β-GRS is associated with reduced β-cell functions and may be useful for selecting patients who should receive more aggressive β-cell-preserving therapy </plain></SENT>
