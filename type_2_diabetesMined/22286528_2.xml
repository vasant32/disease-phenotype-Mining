<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Study design Multicentre parallel (1:1) design, blinded randomised controlled trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> aged 30–75 years and a BMI &gt;27 kg/m2 were randomised, by an independent statistician using sequentially numbered sealed envelopes, to be prescribed either a low-fat high-protein (30% of energy as protein, 40% as carbohydrate, 30% as fat) or a low-fat high carbohydrate(15% of energy as protein, 55%as carbohydrate,30% as fat) diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Participants attended 18 group sessions over 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Primary outcomes were change in weight and waist circumference assessed at baseline, 6 and 12 months.Secondary outcomes were body fatness, glycaemic control,<z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile, blood pressure and renal function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A further assessment was undertaken 12 months after the intervention.Research assessors remained blinded to group allocation throughout </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intention-to-treat analysis was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 419 participants were enrolled (mean±SDage 58±9.5 years,BMI 36.6±6.5 kg/m2 and HbA1c 8.1±1.2%(65 mmol/mol)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The study was completed by 70%(294/419).No differences between groups were found in change in weight or waist circumference during the intervention phase or the 12-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both groups had lost weight (2–3 kg, p&lt;0.001) and reduced their waist circumference (2–3 cm, p&lt;0.001) by 12 months and largely maintained this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> for the following 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>By 6 months, the difference in self-reported dietary protein between groups was small (1.1%total energy; p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No significant differences between groups were found in secondary outcomes: body fatness, HbA1c, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, blood pressure and renal function.There were no important adverse effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In a 'real-world' setting, prescription of an energy-reduced low-fat diet, with either increased protein or carbohydrate, results in similar modest losses in weight and waist circumference over 2 years </plain></SENT>
