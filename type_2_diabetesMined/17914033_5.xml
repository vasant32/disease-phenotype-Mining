<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite muscle <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake playing a major role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the temporal and spatial changes in insulin signaling and GLUT4 translocation during these conditions are not well described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used time-lapse confocal imaging of green fluorescent protein (GFP) <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-ribosylation factor nucleotide-binding site opener (ARNO) (evaluation of phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase activation) and GLUT4-GFP-transfected quadriceps muscle in living, anesthetized mice either muscle denervated or high-fat fed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>T-tubules were visualized with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52101">sulforhodamine B</z:chebi> dye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In incubated muscle, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transport was measured by 2-deoxy-D-[(3)H]-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake, and functional detubulation was carried out by osmotic shock </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Muscle fibers were immunostained for insulin receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Denervation and high-fat diet reduced insulin-mediated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transport </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In denervated muscle, insulin-stimulated phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 P(3) (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16618">PIP3</z:chebi>) production was abolished in T-tubules, while <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16618">PIP3</z:chebi> production at sarcolemma was increased 2.6-fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Correspondingly, GLUT4-GFP translocation to T-tubules was abolished, while translocation to sarcolemma was increased 2.3-fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In high fat-fed mice, a approximately 65% reduction in both insulin-induced T-tubular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16618">PIP3</z:chebi> production and GLUT4-GFP translocation was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sarcolemma was less affected, with reductions of approximately 40% in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16618">PIP3</z:chebi> production and approximately 15% in GLUT4-GFP translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Access to T-tubules was not compromised, and insulin receptor distribution in sarcolemma and T-tubules was unaffected by denervation or high-fat feeding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Detubulation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> muscle reduced basal and abolished insulin-induced <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transport </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate, for the first time, that impaired insulin signaling and GLUT4 translocation is compartmentalized in muscle and primarily localized to T-tubules and not sarcolemma during <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
