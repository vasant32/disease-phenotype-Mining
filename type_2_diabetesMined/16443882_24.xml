<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The original study population consisted of 1,059 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (age 45-64 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CRP values were available from 1,045 subjects, of whom 878 were free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CHD mortality and the incidence of nonfatal MI were assessed in a 7-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Altogether, 157 patients died from CHD and 254 had a nonfatal or fatal CHD event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with hs-CRP &gt;3 mg/l had a higher risk for CHD <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> than patients with hs-CRP &lt; or =3 mg/l (19.8 and 12.9%, respectively, P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In Cox regression analysis, patients with high hs-CRP had a relative risk of 1.72 for CHD <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> even after the adjustment for confounding factors (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among subjects who were free from MI at baseline, those with a high hs-CRP level had relative risks of 1.83 (P = 0.003) and 1.84 (P = 0.004) for CHD <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in univariate and multivariate analyses, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this large cohort of type 2 diabetic patients, hs-CRP was an independent risk factor for CHD <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
