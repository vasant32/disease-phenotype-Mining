<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether cardiac autonomic activity, particularly sympathovagal balance as estimated by power spectral analysis (PSA) of heart rate variation (HRV), is associated with serum adiponectin concentrations in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 105 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (51 women and 54 men) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum adiponectin concentrations were measured by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HRV was determined automatically every 5 min over 24 h using Holter electrocardiographic recording </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PSA of R-R intervals was performed using fast Fourier transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Low-frequency (both sympathetic and parasympathetic activities), high- frequency (pure parasympathetic activity), and the ratio of low-frequency-to-high-frequency power (LF-to-HF ratio), an index of sympathovagal balance, were used as indexes of cardiac autonomic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found no significant correlation between serum adiponectin and low-frequency or high-frequency power in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum adiponectin concentration correlated negatively with the 24-h LF-to-HF ratio (r = -0.343, P = 0.0009) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance (r = -0.411, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serum adiponectin concentrations were significantly higher in patients with overt <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> than in those with normoalbuminuria or <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis controlling for sex, BMI, glycemic control, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile, and renal function, serum adiponectin concentration showed an independent negative association with 24-h LF-to-HF ratio (beta = -0.332, P = 0.020) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, sex, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, and renal function retained significant influence on the serum adiponectin concentration in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Sympathovagal balance favoring relative sympathetic activation was associated with low serum concentrations of adiponectin in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
