<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The practicality of vigorous lowering of systolic pressure in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> to &lt;130 mmHg remains uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Baseline blood pressure data from several recent trials indicate that, in diabetic subjects, there is nearly a fourfold excess in systolic pressure (the difference between baseline pressure and target pressure) over diastolic pressure with respect to the recommended systolic/diastolic target pressure of &lt;130/80 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Additionally, systolic pressure was 2-3 mmHg higher and diastolic pressure was 1-3 mmHg lower in diabetic hypertensive than in nondiabetic hypertensive individuals, which adds approximately 4 mmHg to pulse pressure and also to the difference between the excess systolic and excess diastolic pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We attempted to force (titrate both systolic and excess diastolic pressure) systolic and diastolic blood pressure to &lt;130/85 mmHg based on Joint National Committee VI guidelines in the setting of a clinical practice in 257 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although target systolic pressure was attained in a third of this cohort, in 57% of the patients, the attained diastolic pressure was &lt;or=70 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with final diastolic pressure &lt;70 mmHg were older, had a higher prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, and had higher initial systolic and pulse pressures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Review of achieved blood pressure in studies such as the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">Antihypertensive</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">Lipid</z:chebi>-Lowering Treatment to Prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027051" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MR|mi|AMI">Heart Attack</z:e> Trial (ALLHAT) indicates that a significant fraction of the diabetic subjects' diastolic pressure was also driven down to &lt;70 mmHg or even &lt;60 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, attempted lowering of blood pressure to target systolic pressure is associated with inordinate lowering of diastolic pressure in a significant number of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Whether the benefits of tight systolic control to &lt;130 mmHg outweigh the risks of excessive diastolic reduction, especially in older diabetic subjects or diabetic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, remains unresolved </plain></SENT>
