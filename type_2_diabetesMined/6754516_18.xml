<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eight diabetic subjects were studied before and after 1 week of twice daily insulin therapy; six control subjects matched for age, weight and degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> were also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the diabetic patients, pre-treatment hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production was 20.0 +/- 2.2, 9.9 +/- 2.9, and 1.4 +/- 0.8 mu mol . kg -1 . min -1 respectively (+/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) for each of the three periods, and fell significantly with treatment to 12.8 +/- 1.7, 4.0 +/- 1.5 and 1.9 +/- 1.0 mu mol . kg -1 . min -1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects was 13.2 +/- 0.6, 2.2 +/- 0.8 and less than 1 mu mol . kg -1 . min -1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The pre-treatment metabolic clearance rate in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> diabetic studies with insulin levels greater than or equal to 30 mU/l was 1.10 +/- 0.14 ml . kg -1 . min -1 and remained virtually unchanged following insulin therapy; this was significantly lower than in the control subjects (6.83 +/- 1.02, p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Basal non-esterified fatty acid levels were higher (p less than 0.02) in the pre-treated diabetic patients compared to post-treated diabetic patients and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Non-esterified fatty acids in each group fell to similar levels during the insulin infusions, but the rate of fall was slower in the pre-treated diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Insulin receptor binding to erythrocytes was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in the diabetic subjects and unchanged by treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, following insulin treatment of uncontrolled Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the initially increased basal hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production, and decreased hepatic sensitivity, return towards <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> clearance remains low, despite good diabetic control, and appears to be a major factor in the continuing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As insulin receptor binding is <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, the defect of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> clearance in Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> appears compatible with a post-receptor defect of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
