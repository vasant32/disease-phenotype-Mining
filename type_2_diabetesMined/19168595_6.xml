<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have reported that common variants of HNF1beta were associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Caucasians and West Africans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, analysis in the subjects from the Botnia study and Malm√∂ Preventive Project produced conflicting results, and the role for HNF1beta in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We therefore investigated common variants across the HNF1beta gene in a Chinese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Fifteen tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were analyzed for association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 1,859) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> regulation (n = 1,785) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Consistent with the initial study, we observed evidence that the risk G allele of rs4430796 in intron 2 was significantly associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (odds ratio 1.16 [95% CI 1.05-1.29], P = 0.0035, empirical P = 0.0475) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the at-risk G allele was associated with earlier age at diagnosis in the type 2 diabetic subjects (P = 0.0228) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The result of this study provides evidence that variants in the HNF1beta region contribute to susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the Chinese population </plain></SENT>
