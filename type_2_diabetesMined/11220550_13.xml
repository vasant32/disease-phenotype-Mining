<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We have shown that a positive family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and the variables of general and central <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> are independent risk factors for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in our population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was done to evaluate whether a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001472'>familial predisposition</z:hpo> to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> resulted in a tendency for adverse anthropometric and haemodynamic profiles in south Indian non-diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The analysis was carried out on 2463 subjects (M: F, 1196: 1267) with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (NGT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study subjects were selected from population surveys for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Details of age, sex, family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, body mass index (b.m.i.), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and blood pressure were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> were estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A positive family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was present in 24.7% of our subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean b.m.i. and percentage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> were significantly higher in families with a positive family history (group 2) vs. families with no family history (group 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subjects in group 2 had a higher 2-h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (p &lt; 0.001) and higher prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (chi2 = 6.91, p = 0.0086) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Factor analysis with principle components analysis (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) showed that a family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> clustered with WHR in men, and with b.m.i. and WHR in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The b.m.i. formed a different domain with blood pressure in both sexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>WHR and b.m.i. clustered with cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> in another domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this population, general and central <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> are associated with a family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may increase the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020473" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperlipidaemia</z:e> indirectly through its connection with b.m.i </plain></SENT>
