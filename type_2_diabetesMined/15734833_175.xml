<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To examine the mechanism by which moderate weight reduction improves basal and insulin-stimulated rates of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we used (1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy to assess intrahepatic <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> (IHL) and intramyocellular <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> (IMCL) content in conjunction with hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps using [6,6-(2)H(2)]<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> to assess rates of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production and insulin-stimulated peripheral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eight <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were studied before and after weight stabilization on a moderately hypocaloric very-low-fat diet (3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diabetic patients were markedly insulin resistant in both liver and muscle compared with the lean control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These changes were associated with marked increases in IHL (12.2 +/- 3.4 vs. 0.6 +/- 0.1%; P = 0.02) and IMCL (2.0 +/- 0.3 vs. 1.2 +/- 0.1%; P = 0.02) compared with the control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> of only approximately 8 kg resulted in normalization of fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations (8.8 +/- 0.5 vs. 6.4 +/- 0.3 mmol/l; P &lt; 0.0005), rates of basal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production (193 +/- 7 vs. 153 +/- 10 mg/min; P &lt; 0.0005), and the percentage suppression of hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production during the clamp (29 +/- 22 vs. 99 +/- 3%; P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These improvements in basal and insulin-stimulated hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism were associated with an 81 +/- 4% reduction in IHL (P = 0.0009) but no significant change in insulin-stimulated peripheral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake or IMCL (2.0 +/- 0.3 vs. 1.9 +/- 0.3%; P = 0.21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, these data support the hypothesis that moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> normalizes fasting <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> in patients with poorly controlled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by mobilizing a relatively small pool of IHL, which reverses hepatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and normalizes rates of basal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production, independent of any changes in insulin-stimulated peripheral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
