<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifty type 2 diabetic patients were randomized to receive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> 4 mg/day (n=19) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> 850 mg/day (n=16) with MNT or MNT alone (n=15), for 52 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Arterial stiffness was assessed by using large and small artery elasticity index (SAEI and LAEI, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SAEI, LAEI, serum <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 and MMP-9 levels were measured at baseline and following 52 weeks of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SAEI was improved only in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> group, and the difference was still statistically significant when the three groups were compared (p=0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in LAEI in inter- and intragroup comparisons at the end of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum MMP-9 levels were decreased in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (-13.5+/-34.8%, p=0.02) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> (-27.2+/-51.0%, p=0.023) groups compared with baseline values, whereas no significant change was seen in serum <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> monotherapy has favorable effects on arterial stiffness compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy independent of glycemic control </plain></SENT>
