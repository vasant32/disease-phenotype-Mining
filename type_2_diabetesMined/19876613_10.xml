<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This may be important because even within the normoalbuminuric range, higher rates of <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> are known to be associated with higher renal and cardiovascular risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: At the time of screening for the Randomised <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48416">Olmesartan</z:chebi> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>Microalbuminuria</z:mp> Prevention (ROADMAP) Study, the urinary albumin/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio (UACR) was 0.44 mg/mmol in 4,449 type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The independent correlates of UACR were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Independent correlates of UACR during baseline were (in descending order): night-time systolic BP (r(s) = 0.19); HbA(1c) (r(s) = 0.18); mean 24 h systolic BP (r(s) = 0.16); fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (r(s) = 0.16); night-time diastolic BP (r(s) = 0.12); office systolic BP, sitting (r(s) = 0.11), standing (r(s) = 0.10); estimated GFR (r(s) = 0.10); heart rate, sitting (r(s) = 0.10); <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (r(s) = -0.10); triacylglycerol (r(s) = 0.09); and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> (r(s) = -0.08; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p &lt;or= 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significantly higher albumin excretion rates were found for the following categorical variables: higher waist circumference (more marked in men); presence of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e>; smoking (difference more marked in males); female sex; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> treatment; use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2668">amlodipine</z:chebi>; insulin treatment; family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; and family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (more marked in women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Although observational correlations do not prove causality, in normoalbuminuric type 2 diabetic patients the albumin excretion rate is correlated with many factors that are potentially susceptible to intervention </plain></SENT>
