<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 70 inactive people with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were given standard exercise information and randomised to receive physical activity counselling (n=35, experimental) or not (n=35, control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Physical activity consultations were delivered at baseline and after 6 months, with follow-up phone calls after 1, 3, 6 and 9 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Changes from baseline after 6 and 12 months were assessed for physical activity (7-day recall and accelerometer), for physiological characteristics (body mass index and blood pressure) and for biochemical variables (HbA(1)c, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile, fibrinogen, tissue plasminogen activator and <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant differences between groups were recorded for physical activity after 6 and 12 months (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The experimental group had increased levels of physical activity from baseline to 6 months (p&lt;0.01), with no decrease from 6 to 12 months (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the control group, accelerometer counts per week decreased from baseline to 12 months (p=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Between-group differences (p&lt;0.05) were recorded for the change in HbA(1)c (experimental: 0.26% decrease; control: 0.15% increase), for systolic blood pressure (experimental: 7.7 mm Hg decrease; control: 5.6 mm Hg increase) and for fibrinogen (experimental: 0.28 mmol/l decrease; control: 1.43 mmol/l increase) from baseline to 6 months, and for total cholesterol (experimental: 0.33 mmol/l decrease; control: 0.04 mmol/l increase) from baseline to 12 months (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were recorded in other measured variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATIONS: Physical activity counselling was effective in promoting physical activity in people with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The counselling improved glycaemic control as well as the status of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> in these patients </plain></SENT>
