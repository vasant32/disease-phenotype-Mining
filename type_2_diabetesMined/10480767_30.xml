<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to compare Humalog Mix25 to human insulin 30/70 (30% regular insulin/70% <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e>) with respect to glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Humalog Mix25 was compared with human insulin 30/70 in 89 individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during a 6-month randomized open-label two-period crossover study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each insulin was administered twice daily, before the morning and evening meals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Information regarding self-monitored blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (BG), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001988'>hypoglycemic episodes</z:hpo> (hypoglycemic signs or symptoms or BG &lt; or = 3.0 mmol/l), insulin dose, and HbA1c was collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treatment with Humalog Mix25 resulted in better postprandial glycemic control after the morning and evening meals compared with treatment with human insulin 30/70 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall glycemic control and the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> were comparable between the treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In comparison to treatment with human insulin 30/70, twice daily administration of Humalog Mix25 resulted in improved postprandial glycemic control, similar overall glycemic control, and the convenience of dosing immediately before meals </plain></SENT>
