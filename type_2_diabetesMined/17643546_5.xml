<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The contribution of self-management education to adherence in general or even more specifically to medicine taking is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed educational interventions aimed at improving adherence to medical treatment recommendations, other than lifestyle advice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Systematic literature review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: This paper represents an analysis of eight articles describing an educational intervention as a subgroup of a Cochrane Review [E </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No.: CD003638, doi:10.1002/14651858.CD003638.pub2] on interventions to improve adherence to treatment recommendations in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four studies reported interventions using face-to-face education, two reported on the effects of group education and two on distance education by telemedicine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Due to poor quality of study designs, a variety of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> outcome measures in different time intervals, unclear definitions of adherence, and difficulties in evaluating different aspects of education performed, general conclusions could not be drawn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Consistent conclusions about the effectiveness of educational interventions on adherence to treatment recommendations were hard to be drawn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There is an urgent need for well-designed intervention studies on the effect of different aspects of education on adherence to treatment recommendations </plain></SENT>
