<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2DM) have an increased mortality rate primarily because of macrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Where T2DM patients cannot be managed sufficiently through diet, exercise and peroral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs, that is when <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA1c) is above 7.0%, it is yet unknown whether a combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and insulin analogues is superior to insulin analogues alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nor is it known which insulin analogue regimen is the optimal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate the effect of an 18-month treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> vs. placebo in combination with one of three insulin analogue regimens, the primary outcome measure being carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) in T2DM patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A randomized, stratified, multicentre trial having a 2 x 3 factorial design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> part is double masked and placebo controlled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The insulin treatment is open </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The intervention period is 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PATIENT POPULATION: Nine hundred and fifty patients with T2DM and HbA1c &gt; or = 7.5% on treatment with oral hypoglycaemic agents or on insulin treatment and deemed able, by the investigator, to manage once-daily insulin therapy with a long-acting insulin analogue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RANDOMIZATION: Central randomization stratified for age (above 65 years), previous insulin treatment and treatment centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> 1 g x two times daily vs. placebo (approximately 475 patients vs. 475 patients) in combination with insulin detemir before bedtime (approximately 315 patients) or biphasic insulin aspart 30 before dinner with the possibility to increase to two or three injections daily (approximately 315 patients) or insulin aspart before the main meals (three times daily) and insulin detemir before bedtime (approximately 315 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Intervention follows a treat-to-target principle in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six arms aiming for an HbA1c &lt; or = 7.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome measure is the change in CIMT from baseline to 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Secondary outcome measures comprises the composite outcome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath> assessed by an adjudication committee blinded to intervention, other cardiovascular clinical outcomes, average postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> increment from 0 to 18 months, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> and any inadvertent medical episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In addition, change in plaque formation in the carotids, HbA1c, cardiovascular biomarkers, body composition, progression of microvascular complications and quality of life will be assessed as tertiary outcome measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>TIME SCHEDULE: Patient enrolment started May 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Follow-up is expected to finish in March 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CIMT is designed to provide evidence as to whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> is advantageous even during insulin treatment and to provide evidence regarding which insulin analogue regimen is most advantageous with regard to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
