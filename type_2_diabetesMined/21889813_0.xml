<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To examine the relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0004934'>vascular calcification</z:hpo> in the foot (FVC) and bone mineral density (BMD) in the heel of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM) subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 65 subjects with type 2 DM and serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>&lt;125 Î¼mol/l underwent CT scanning of the foot to assess FVC and dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan to assess heel BMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Routine biochemistry including osteoprotegerin (OPG) and Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) was also carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The proportion of subjects with FVC was 43%, whilst 40% had low BMD (T score&lt;-1.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Age, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> and 25 hydroxyvitamin D were independent predictors of FVC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Body-weight, eGFR, 25 hydroxyvitamin D, OPG, and total cholesterol were independent predictors of low heel BMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> and BMD or FVC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in heel BMD between those with FVC and those without, but those with frank <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> were significantly more likely to have FVC than those with higher BMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is no clear-cut association between FVC and low BMD in type 2 DM with relatively well-preserved renal function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Age, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e>, eGFR, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, body-weight, 25 hydroxyvitamin D and OPG play a complex role in their pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
