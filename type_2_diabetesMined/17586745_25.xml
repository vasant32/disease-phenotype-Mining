<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Among hepatic enzymes, gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) is the main predictor of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence, although it has not been shown that GGT predicts pre-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> states </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to study the association of GGT with the development of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> (MetS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed the 3-year data from the Data from Epidemiological Study on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin Resistance</z:hpo> Syndrome prospective cohort of 1,656 men and 1,889 women without MetS at baseline, according to the International <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Federation definition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over 3 years, 309 participants developed the MetS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for age, alcohol intake, physical activity, smoking habits, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), the odds ratios for incident MetS increased across baseline GGT quartiles (1, 1.96, 2.25, and 3.81 in men, P &lt; 0.03; and 1, 1.23, 1.80, and 1.58 in women, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After additional adjustment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> markers (fasting insulin or homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> index), the association was attenuated and the linear relation no longer significant in both sexes (P = 0.08, P = 0.16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, men in the highest in comparison to the lowest quartile of GGT retained a significant risk for incident MetS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In women, there was no longer a significant risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>GGT was significantly associated with the 3-year incidence of individual components of the MetS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence of the MetS also increased with ALT, but after adjustment on GGT this association remained significant only in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: GGT, a predictor of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, was associated with a risk of incident MetS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This association was mainly related with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> but was independent of other confounding factors </plain></SENT>
