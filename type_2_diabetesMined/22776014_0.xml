<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety-nine patients were administered teneligliptin 10 or 20 mg or placebo before breakfast for 4 weeks in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both teneligliptin-treated groups showed significantly smaller 2-h postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (2-h <z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi>), 24-h mean <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> values than the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The differences between the teneligliptin 10 mg and placebo groups in changes in 2-h <z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi> after each meal were -50.7 ± 7.8, -34.8 ± 9.2 and -37.5 ± 7.5 mg/dl at breakfast, lunch and dinner, respectively [least-squares (LS) means ± standard error (s.e.), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, p &lt; 0.001] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The corresponding LS means ± s.e. for teneligliptin 20 mg versus placebo were -38.1 ± 7.8, -28.6 ± 9.2 and -36.1 ± 7.5 mg/dl, respectively (p &lt; 0.001, p &lt; 0.01, p &lt; 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both doses of teneligliptin increased postprandial plasma active glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 concentrations compared with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of adverse events and drug-related adverse events was similar among groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no hypoglycaemic symptoms or serious adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Once-daily teneligliptin improved blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels over 24 h without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
