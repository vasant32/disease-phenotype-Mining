<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> are increasingly affecting human populations around the world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our goal was to identify early molecular signatures predicting genetic risk to these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic diseases</z:e> using two strains of mice that differ greatly in disease susceptibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We integrated metabolic characterization, gene expression, protein-protein interaction networks, RT-PCR, and flow cytometry analyses of adipose, skeletal muscle, and liver tissue of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-prone C57BL/6NTac (B6) mice and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-resistant 129S6/SvEvTac (129) mice at 6 weeks and 6 months of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At 6 weeks of age, B6 mice were metabolically indistinguishable from 129 mice, however, adipose tissue showed a consistent gene expression signature that differentiated between the strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In particular, immune system gene networks and inflammatory biomarkers were upregulated in adipose tissue of B6 mice, despite a low <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fat mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This was accompanied by increased T-cell and macrophage infiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression of the same networks and biomarkers, particularly those related to T-cells, further increased in adipose tissue of B6 mice, but only minimally in 129 mice, in response to <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> promoted by age or high-fat diet, further exacerbating the differences between strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo> in mice with differential susceptibility to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> is preceded by differences in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> of adipose tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon may serve as an early indicator of disease and contribute to disease susceptibility and progression </plain></SENT>
