<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We sought to study the optimal management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> in non-intensive care unit patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, as few studies thus far have focused on the subject </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective, multicenter, randomized trial to compare the efficacy and safety of a basal-bolus insulin regimen with that of sliding-scale regular insulin (SSI) in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 130 insulin-naive patients were randomized to receive glargine and glulisine (n = 65) or a standard SSI protocol (n = 65) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Glargine was given once daily and glulisine before meals at a starting dose of 0.4 units x kg(-1) x day(-1) for blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> 140-200 mg/dl or 0.5 units x kg(-1) x day(-1) for blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> 201-400 mg/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SSI was given four times per day for blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &gt;140 mg/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean admission blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was 229 +/- 6 mg/dl and A1C 8.8 +/- 2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> target of &lt;140 mg/dl was achieved in 66% of patients in the glargine and glulisine group and in 38% of those in the SSI group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean daily blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> between groups ranged from 23 to 58 mg/dl, with an overall blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> difference of 27 mg/dl (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Despite increasing insulin doses, 14% of patients treated with SSI remained with blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &gt;240 mg/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in the rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> or length of hospital stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with insulin glargine and glulisine resulted in significant improvement in glycemic control compared with that achieved with the use of SSI alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our study indicates that a basal-bolus insulin regimen is preferred over SSI in the management of non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">critically ill</z:e>, hospitalized patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
