<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression of gluconeogenic genes was measured by quantitative real-time PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity was analyzed using insulin tolerance tests and insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of insulin receptors and Akt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Glucagon action was examined using glucagon tolerance tests and glucagon-stimulated HGP, cAMP-responsive element-binding (CREB) phosphorylation, and expression of gluconeogenic genes in the liver and primary hepatocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hepatocyte-specific TRAF2 knockout (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32035">HKO</z:chebi>) mice exhibited <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> body weight, blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, and insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Under HFD conditions, blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were significantly lower (by &gt;30%) in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32035">HKO</z:chebi> than in control mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Both insulin signaling and the hypoglycemic response to insulin were similar between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32035">HKO</z:chebi> and control mice </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the hepatic TRAF2 cell autonomously promotes hepatic gluconeogenesis by enhancing the hyperglycemic response to glucagon and other factors that increase cAMP levels, thus contributing to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
