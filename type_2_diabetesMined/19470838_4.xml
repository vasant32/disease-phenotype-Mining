<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial, 567 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> received 20 intravenous infusions of actovegin (2,000 mg/day) (n = 281) or placebo (n = 286) once daily followed by three tablets of actovegin (1,800 mg/day) or placebo three times daily for 140 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Total symptom score (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TSS</z:e>) of the lower limbs and vibration perception threshold (VPT) were used as coprimary outcome measures, computed as the area under the curve (AUC) from repeated scores and divided by duration of exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Secondary end points included individual <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TSS</z:e> symptoms, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> impairment score of the lower limbs (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="53204">NIS</z:chebi>-LL), and quality of life (short form [SF]-36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TSS</z:e> was significantly improved during actovegin treatment compared with placebo, as assessed by AUC (-0.56 points [95% CI -0.85 to -0.27]; P = 0.0003), and from baseline to 160 days (-0.86 points [-1.22 to -0.50]; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>VPT (five sites per foot) decreased by 3% (95% CI 0-6; P = 0.084) with actovegin than placebo, as assessed by AUC, and by 5% (1-9; P = 0.017) after 160 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="15" ids="53204">NIS</z:chebi>-LL sensory function, as assessed by AUC, was significantly improved with actovegin versus placebo (-0.25 [95% CI -0.46 to -0.04]; P = 0.021), as was the SF-36 mental health domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in the incidence of adverse events between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS Sequential intravenous and oral actovegin treatment over 160 days improved neuropathic symptoms, VPT, sensory function, and quality of life in type 2 diabetic patients with symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001271'>polyneuropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
