<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate, by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37804">thallium-201</z:chebi> scanning, circulation in the muscles of the lower limb (LL) in diabetic patients without clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo> but with a high cardiovascular risk profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 80 diabetic patients (76 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, mean age 57.3 years, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> 13.0 +/- 7.5 years) with more than one additional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factor</z:e> but no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1456822" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">claudication</z:e> were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After stress testing, 1.5 MBq/kg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37804">thallium-201</z:chebi> was administered to perform myocardial single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography followed by LL scanning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Muscle blood flow was considered abnormal if the asymmetry in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37804">thallium-201</z:chebi> uptake between the two buttocks and/or thighs and/or calves was &gt; 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Muscle perfusion defects were found in 42% of the patients, mainly in the calves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These defects correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (P = 0.042) and the HbA1c level (P = 0.044) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with defects in the buttock and/or thigh, the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> was higher than in those with isolated defects in the calf (P = 0.032 and 0.023, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that LL scanning coupled with myocardial scintigraphy is a convenient method of investigating peripheral muscle circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Proximal perfusion defects in patients without clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial disease</z:e> are associated with increased prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> and, therefore, may be due to microvascular disease of LL muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Distal defects may indicate silent macrovascular disease of the LL </plain></SENT>
