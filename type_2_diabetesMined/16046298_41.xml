<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we found that db/db mice on the FVB genetic background with loss-of-function mutation of the leptin receptor (FVB-Lepr(db) mice or FVBdb/db) develop severe diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000096'>glomerulosclerosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005576'>tubulointerstitial fibrosis</z:hpo>, increased expression of type IV collagen and fibronectin, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo>, which is associated with increased renal <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> abundance of transforming growth factor-beta, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and vascular endothelial growth factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopy demonstrates increases in glomerular basement membrane thickness and foot process (podocyte) length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that there is a marked increase in neutral <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> deposits in glomeruli and tubules by oil red O staining and biochemical analysis for cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also detected a significant increase in the renal expression of adipocyte differentiation-related protein (adipophilin), a marker of cytoplasmic <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> droplets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We examined the expression of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15889">sterol</z:chebi> regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1 and -2, transcriptional factors that play an important role in the regulation of fatty acid, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>, and cholesterol synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found significant increases in SREBP-1 and -2 protein levels in nuclear extracts from the kidneys of FVBdb/db mice, with increases in the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> abundance of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15351">acetyl-CoA</z:chebi> carboxylase, fatty acid synthase, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="11814">3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA</z:chebi> reductase, which mediates the increase in renal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> and cholesterol content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that in FVBdb/db mice, renal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> and cholesterol accumulation is mediated by increased activity of SREBP-1 and -2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on our previous results with transgenic mice overexpressing SREBP-1 in the kidney, we propose that increased expression of SREBPs plays an important role in causing renal <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> accumulation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000096'>glomerulosclerosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005576'>tubulointerstitial fibrosis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> in mice with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
