<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare age-related changes in the mechanical properties of different arterial segments in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers and subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In 169 subjects (diabetic n = 57 and nondiabetic n = 112), we assessed the mechanical properties of three arterial segments of differing wall composition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pulse wave velocity (PWV) was measured noninvasively in a thoraco-abdominal segment (carotid femoral PWV [PWV(cf)]), in an upper limb muscular artery (carotid radial PWV [PWV(cr)]), and from the aorta to the finger (PWV from the aorta to the finger [PWV(fin)]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Central aortic compliance (CAC) was also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Average CAC was lower (0.662 vs. 0.850, P &lt; 0.05) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> measures of PWV tended to be faster in diabetic subjects despite the fact that they were, on average, 10 years younger </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, these measures were not related to age in diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After correcting for blood pressure, only PWV(cf) was associated with age in nondiabetic subjects (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Expressing results as ratios of nonelastic to elastic arterial segments (i.e., PWV(cr)-to-PWV(cf) and PWV(fin)-to-PWV(cf)) improved the relationship with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both PWV(cr)-to-PWV(cf) and PWV(fin)-to-PWV(cf) were significantly associated with age in nondiabetic subjects (r = -0.59, P &lt; 0.001; r = -0.57, P &lt; 0.001) but not in diabetic subjects (r = -0.15, P = 0.302; r = -0.24, P = 0.129) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that the ratios were not associated with systolic blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There are significant differences in the rate of age-related decline in vascular stiffness in elastic arteries of nondiabetic compared with diabetic arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Diabetic arteries appear to age at an accelerated rate at an earlier age and then reach a functional plateau </plain></SENT>
