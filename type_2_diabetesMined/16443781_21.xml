<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This issue was explored in 911 nondiabetic Pima Indian mothers and 1,436 of their children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Associations were assessed in multivariate models between maternal third trimester <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance and indexes of body composition and glycemic control in their children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At parturition, the mothers' ages ranged from 14 to 43 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Offspring were studied at age 0-39 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An SD (1.3 mmol/l) of maternal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was associated with 56 g higher birth weight (P = 0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This effect persisted when only offspring of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerant mothers were examined (57 g, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In Cox proportional hazards models, the adjusted hazard rate ratio for offspring risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> per SD maternal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was 1.6 (95% CI 1.3-2.0, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When only offspring of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerant mothers were examined, the risk was reduced but remained significant (1.3 [1.04-1.71], P = 0.026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, maternal glycemia during pregnancy is associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0009673'>increased birth weight</z:mp> and risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Pima Indian offspring, even when mothers are <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerant during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, prevention of offspring type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may require strategies that focus on improving gestational <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance even within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
