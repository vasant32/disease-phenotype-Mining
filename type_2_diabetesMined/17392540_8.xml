<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> versus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> in pediatric subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> inadequately controlled with diet and exercise alone or oral monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This 26-week, single-blind, active-controlled, multinational study randomized 285 subjects to receive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> (1-8 mg once daily) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (500-1000 mg twice daily) for 24 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was mean change in A1C from baseline to week 24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Safety was assessed by incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> and other adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant reductions from baseline A1C were seen in both the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> (-0.54%, P = 0.001) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (-0.71%, P = 0.0002) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 42.4% (56 of 132) and 48.1% (63 of 131) of subjects in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> groups, respectively, in the intent-to-treat population achieved A1C &lt;7.0% at week 24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were observed between groups in reductions in A1C and self-monitored blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, changes in serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> concentrations, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant differences were observed in mean changes from baseline in BMI between groups (0.26 kg/m(2) for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> and -0.33 kg/m(2) for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>; P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The adjusted mean body weight increase was 1.97 kg for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> and 0.55 kg for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (P = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0745153" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycemic episode</z:e> with blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &lt;50 mg/dl (&lt;2.8 mmol/l) was experienced by 4.9 and 4.2% of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi>- and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>-treated subjects, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A single severe hypoglycemic event occurred in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">Glimepiride</z:chebi> reduced A1C similarly to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> with greater <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>, and there was comparable safety over 24 weeks in the treatment of pediatric subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
