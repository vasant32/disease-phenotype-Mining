<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we re-interpret previously published data on [(13)C]<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> recovery in breath gas obtained during exercise in type 2 diabetic patients and control individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: When infusing [(13)C]<z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> to estimate fat oxidation, part of the label is lost in exchange reactions of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27093">tricarboxylic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi>) cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To correct for this loss of label, an <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> recovery factor (ARF) has previously been used, assuming that 100% of the exogenously provided <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> will enter the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi> cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The recovery of <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> in breath gas depends on the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi> cycle activity, hence providing an indirect measure of the latter and a marker of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Re-evaluation of the available literature reveals that the ARF during exercise is highest in lean, healthy individuals, followed by <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals and type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Revisiting previously published findings on the ARF during exercise in type 2 diabetic patients reveals a reduction in muscular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi> cycle flux, reflecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction, in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>How <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction is related to type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>-cause or consequence-requires further study </plain></SENT>
