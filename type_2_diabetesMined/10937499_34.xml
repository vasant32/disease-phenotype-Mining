<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the relationship between efficacy of the drug and body fat distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Changes in body fat distribution were also investigated by long-term administration of the drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">Troglitazone</z:chebi> was given at a dose of 400 mg/day to 20 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> whose diet and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> therapy produced unsatisfactory glycemic control (HbA(1c) &gt;7.8%) and whose insulin secretory capacity was found to be preserved (postprandial C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> &gt;3 ng/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HbA(1c) values, serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels, and body weight were measured monthly Body fat distribution was evaluated in subcutaneous (SC) and visceral fat using a computed tomography scan at umbilical levels before and after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> therapy RESULTS: During the 1-year <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> treatment, HbA(1c) was significantly decreased (from 9.2 +/- 0.2 to 7.1 +/- 0.2%, P &lt; 0.01), showing lowest values at 4-6 months, whereas body weight was significantly increased (BMI 24.6 +/- 0.6 to 25.7 +/- 0.6 kg/m2, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reduction of HbA(1c) (deltaHbA(1c)) from the baseline value during treatment was significantly greater in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients (BMI &gt;26 kg/m2) than in nonobese patients (-3.2 +/- 0.4 vs. -2.1 +/- 0.3%, P &lt; 0.05) and was more significant in women than in men (-3.2 +/- 0.2 vs. - 1.4 +/- 0.2%, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The level of deltaHbA(1c) during treatment showed a significant negative correlation with SC fat area (r = -0.742, P &lt; 0.01) but not with visceral fat area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>Weight gain</z:mp> during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> treatment resulted in increased accumulation of SC fat without a change in visceral fat area and, consequently. in a significant decrease in the visceral-to-SC fat ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Predominant accumulation of SC fat for the visceral fat tissue was an important predictor of the efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> therapy in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Greater efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> was observed in women who were characterized by more accumulation of SC adipose tissue than men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Long-term administration of the drug resulted in <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> with increased accumulation of SC adipose tissue, probably because of the activation of PPAR-gamma in the region </plain></SENT>
