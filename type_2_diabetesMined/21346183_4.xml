<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of intensive versus standard glycemic control strategies on health-related quality of life (HRQL) in a substudy of the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> (ACCORD) trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A randomly selected subsample of 2,053 ACCORD participants enrolled in the HRQL substudy was assessed at baseline and 12-, 36-, and 48-month visits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HRQL assessment included general health status (the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey [SF-36]), <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> symptoms (the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Symptom Distress Checklist), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ]-9), and treatment satisfaction (<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire [DTSQ]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Repeated-measures ANOVA models were used to estimate change in HRQL outcomes by treatment group over 48 months adjusting for model covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effects of early discontinuation of the ACCORD intensive glycemic control arm on study results were explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 1,956 (95%) completed the self-report HRQL instrument(s) at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The intensive arm had a larger decrease in SF-36 physical health component score than the standard arm (-1.6 vs. -1.1, P = 0.0345) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment satisfaction (DTSQ) showed larger improvement with intensive than standard (P = 0.0004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in mean scores of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Symptom Checklist and PHQ-9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Effects of participant transition following discontinuation of the intensive arm on HRQL were not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The ACCORD trial strategy of intensive glycemic control did not lead to benefits in HRQL and was associated with modest improvement in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treatment satisfaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus patient acceptability was apparently not compromised with intensive and complex interventions such as those used in ACCORD </plain></SENT>
