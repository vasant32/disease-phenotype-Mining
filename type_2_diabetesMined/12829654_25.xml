<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is a strong risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is associated with reduced baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) and heart rate variability (HRV), which are indicators of increased risk for mortality and morbidity in various patient populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to assess the effects of exercise training on BRS, HRV, and hemodynamics in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects (50 men, mean age 53.3 +/- 5.1 years) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were randomized into either a control group, in which they received conventional treatment only, or an exercise group, in which they received conventional treatment together with heart rate-controlled endurance training twice a week and supervised muscle strength training twice a week for 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Measurements taken at baseline and follow-up included VO(2max), standard time and frequency domain measures of HRV during 24-h recording, and BRS by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi> method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cardiac index, systemic vascular resistance index, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> index, and pulse wave velocity were measured by whole-body impedance cardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant improvements in VO(2max) (exercise group: +2.3 ml x kg(-1) x min(-1); P &lt; 0.005 vs. control group), muscle strength, and glycemic control (exercise group: HbA(1c) -0.9%; P &lt; 0.001 vs. control group) were observed in the exercise group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BRS increased in the exercise group, from 6.8 to 8.6 ms/mmHg, and decreased in the control group, from 7.5 to 6.4 ms/mmHg (95% CI for the difference between 0.05 and 4.36 ms/mmHg; P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant changes in the time or frequency domain measures of HRV or in systemic hemodynamics were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We concluded that exercise training improves BRS sensitivity in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> subjects in addition to increasing the exercise capacity and muscle strength and improving <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These beneficial effects in reflectory autonomic regulation and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control caused by exercise may be associated with improved prognosis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
