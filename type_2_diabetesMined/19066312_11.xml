<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Increased availability of fatty acids is important for accumulation of intracellular <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in human myotubes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is unknown whether different types of fatty acids like eicosapentaenoic acid (<z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi>) or tetradecylthioacetic acid (TTA) influence these processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We examined fatty acid and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism and gene expression in cultured human skeletal muscle cells from control and type 2 diabetic individuals after 4 days of preincubation with <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> or TTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> myotubes exhibited reduced formation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15756">palmitic acid</z:chebi> (PA), whereas release of beta-oxidation products was unchanged at baseline but significantly increased with respect to control myotubes after preincubation with TTA and <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preincubation with TTA enhanced both complete (<z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi>) and beta-oxidation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15756">palmitic acid</z:chebi>, whereas <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> increased only beta-oxidation significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> markedly enhanced triacylglycerol (TAG) accumulation in myotubes, more pronounced in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TAG accumulation and fatty acid oxidation were inversely correlated only after <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> preincubation, and total level of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17984">acyl-CoA</z:chebi> was reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> oxidation (<z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> formation) was enhanced and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> production decreased after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> exposure to <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> and TTA, whereas <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake and storage were unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> and especially TTA increased the expression of genes involved in fatty acid uptake, activation, accumulation, and oxidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that 1) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction in diabetic myotubes is caused by disturbances downstream of fatty acid beta-oxidation; 2) <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> promoted accumulation of TAG, enhanced beta-oxidation, and increased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> oxidation; and 3) TTA improved complete <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15756">palmitic acid</z:chebi> oxidation in diabetic myotubes, opposed increased <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> accumulation, and increased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> oxidation </plain></SENT>
