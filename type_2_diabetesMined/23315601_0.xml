<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the current investigation was to examine the utility of elevated 1-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels to prospectively predict deterioration in β-cell function and the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetes</z:e> in high-risk youth.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSObese Latino youth with a family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (133 male and 100 female; age 11.1 ± 1.7 years) completed a baseline OGTT and were divided into two groups based upon a 1-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> threshold of 155 mg/dL (&lt;155 mg/dL, n = 151, or ≥155 mg/dL, n = 82) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Youth were followed annually for up to 8 years for assessment of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, body composition by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, and the disposition index by the frequently sampled intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test.RESULTSOver time, the ≥155 mg/dL group exhibited a significantly greater decline in β-cell function compared with youth with a 1-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &lt;155 mg/dL (β = -327.8 ± 126.2, P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, this decline was independent of fasting or 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and body composition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When the data were restricted to only participants with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance at baseline, a 1-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> ≥155 mg/dL was independently associated with a 2.5 times greater likelihood of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetes</z:e> during follow-up (95% CI 1.6-4.1, P = 0.0001).CONCLUSIONSThese data suggest that a 1-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> ≥155 mg/dL during an OGTT is an independent predictor of β-cell deterioration and progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetes</z:e> among <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> Latino youth </plain></SENT>
