<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is a global public health crisis that threatens the economies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> nations, particularly developing countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fueled by rapid urbanization, nutrition transition, and increasingly sedentary lifestyles, the epidemic has grown in parallel with the worldwide rise in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Asia's large population and rapid economic development have made it an epicenter of the epidemic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Asian populations tend to develop <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at younger ages and lower BMI levels than Caucasians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Several factors contribute to accelerated <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> epidemic in Asians, including the "<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-weight metabolically <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>" phenotype; high prevalence of smoking and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0687132" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">heavy alcohol use</z:e>; high intake of refined carbohydrates (e.g., white rice); and dramatically decreased physical activity levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Poor nutrition in utero and in early life combined with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1257763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">overnutrition</z:e> in later life may also play a role in Asia's <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> epidemic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recent advances in genome-wide association studies have contributed substantially to our understanding of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> pathophysiology, but currently identified genetic loci are insufficient to explain ethnic differences in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, interactions between Westernized diet and lifestyle and genetic background may accelerate the growth of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the context of rapid nutrition transition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Epidemiologic studies and randomized clinical trials show that type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is largely preventable through diet and lifestyle modifications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Translating these findings into practice, however, requires fundamental changes in public policies, the food and built environments, and health systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>To curb the escalating <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> epidemic, primary prevention through promotion of a healthy diet and lifestyle should be a global public policy priority </plain></SENT>
