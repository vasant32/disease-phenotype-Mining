<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the role of genetic factors that contribute to various measures of subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> is largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, measured as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001717'>coronary artery calcification</z:hpo> (CAC), will be extensive in individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and that its presence depends on both genetic and environmental factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The genetic factors should result in the familial aggregation of CAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To determine the extent of familial aggregation of CAC in the presence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we studied 122 individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (mean age 60 years) and 13 individuals without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in 56 families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CAC was measured by fast-gated helical computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other measured factors included blood pressure, body size, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, HbA1c, and self-reported medical history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To test for an association between CAC and these factors while accounting for the potential familial correlation of CAC, generalized estimating equations were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CAC was detectable in 80% of individuals with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (median score 84, range 0-5,776) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Extent of CAC, adjusted for age, was positively associated with male sex (P = 0.0003), reduced <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> (P = 0.02), albumin-to-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio (P = 0.008), and cigarette pack-years (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CAC was also positively associated with a history of <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and vascular procedures (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>HbA1c and fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> were positively, but nonsignificantly, associated with the extent of CAC (P = 0.14 and 0.08, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CAC, adjusted for age, sex, race, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> status, was heritable (h2 = 0.50; P = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis with additional adjustment for <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>, BMI, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and smoking, h2 = 0.40 (P = 0.038) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that strong (independent) genetic factors as well as environmental factors contribute to the variance of CAC in individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In these data, CAC seems heritable and may serve as an important feature in designing studies to map genes contributing to both <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
