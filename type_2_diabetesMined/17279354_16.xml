<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is unknown whether CRP directly affects insulin signalling action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To this aim, we determined the effects of human recombinant CRP (hrCRP) on insulin signalling involved in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transport in L6 myotubes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: L6 myotubes were exposed to endotoxin-free hrCRP and insulin-stimulated activation of signal molecules, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthesis were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that hrCRP stimulates both c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These effects were paralleled by a concomitant increase in IRS-1 phosphorylation at Ser(307) and Ser(612), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The stimulatory effects of hrCRP on IRS-1 phosphorylation at Ser(307) and Ser(612) were partially reversed by treatment with specific JNK and ERK1/2 inhibitors, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Exposure of L6 myotubes to hrCRP reduced insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of IRS-1 at Tyr(632), a site essential for engaging p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI-3K), protein kinase B (Akt) activation and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These events were accompanied by a decrease in insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transporter (GLUT) 4 translocation to the plasma membrane, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> incorporation into <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The inhibitory effects of hrCRP on insulin signalling and insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation were reversed by treatment with JNK inhibitor I and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37699">protein kinase inhibitor</z:chebi>, PD98059 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our data suggest that hrCRP may cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> by increasing IRS-1 phosphorylation at Ser(307) and Ser(612) via JNK and ERK1/2, respectively, leading to impaired insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake, GLUT4 translocation, and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthesis mediated by the IRS-1/PI-3K/Akt/GSK-3 pathway </plain></SENT>
