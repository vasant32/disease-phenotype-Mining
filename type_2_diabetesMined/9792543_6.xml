<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diabetic and nondiabetic subjects were studied on three occasions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hormone secretion was inhibited with somatostatin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Insulin concentrations were kept at "basal" levels (referred to as low insulin infusion) from 0 to 180 min then increased to approximately 200 pmol/l from 181 to 360 min (referred to as high insulin infusion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> concentrations were clamped at either approximately 95, approximately 130, or approximately 165 mg/dl on each occasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the presence of basal insulin concentrations, a progressive increase in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> from 95 to 130 to 165 mg/dl was accompanied by a comparable and progressive decrease (P = 0.001 to 0.003 by analysis of variance [ANOVA]) in endogenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production (measured with [6-(3)H]<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>) and total <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> output (measured with [2-(3)H]<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>) and incorporation of 14CO2 into <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (an index of gluconeogenesis) in both diabetic and nondiabetic subjects, indicating <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hepatic (and perhaps renal) response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the nondiabetic subjects, an increase in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration from 95 to 130 to 165 mg/dl resulted in a progressive increase in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disappearance during both the low (19.9 +/- 1.8 to 23.6 +/- 1.8 to 25.4 +/- 1.6 micromol x kg(-1) x min(-1); P = 0.003 by ANOVA) and high (36.4 +/- 3.1 to 47.6 +/- 4.5 to 61.1 +/- 7.0 micromol x kg(-1) x min(-1); P = 0.001 by ANOVA) insulin infusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in the diabetic subjects, whereas an increase in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> from 95 to 130 mg/dl resulted in an increase in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disappearance during both the low (P = 0.001) and high (P = 0.01) dose insulin infusions, a further increase in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration to 165 mg/dl had no further effect (P = 0.41 and 0.38) on disappearance at either insulin dose (low: 14.2 +/- 0.8 to 18.2 +/- 1.1 to 18.7 +/- 2.4 micromol x kg(-1) x min(-1); high: 21.0 +/- 3.2 to 33.9 +/- 6.4 to 32.5 +/- 8.0 micromol x kg(-1) x min(-1) for 95, 130, and 165 mg/dl, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that whereas <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced stimulation of its own uptake is abnormal in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced suppression of endogenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production and output is not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The abnormality in uptake occurs in the presence of both basal and high insulin concentrations and is evident at <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations above but not below 130 mg/dl, implying a defect in a <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-responsive step </plain></SENT>
