<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the occurrence and development of new <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306889" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">peripheral arterial occlusive disease</z:e> (PAOD), its risk factors, and the outcome in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 130 type 2 diabetic patients (mean age 58 years) were examined at baseline and after a mean follow-up of 11 years (range 7-14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ankle-brachial index (ABI) and toe-brachial index were used to detect PAOD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood and urine samples were taken at baseline, and a history of cardiovascular events was recorded during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PAOD was diagnosed in 21 (16%) patients at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, 21 of 89 (24%) patients developed new PAOD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 29 patients who died, 21 (72%) of them from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with PAOD suffered an excess mortality compared with patients without PAOD (58 vs. 16%; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis showed that PAOD at baseline was associated with age, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, smoking, and urinary albumin excretion rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients who developed new PAOD during follow-up had higher serum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> concentrations and lower <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> concentrations and were older than the patients who remained free of PAOD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Objectively measured PAOD is frequent in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It presents the early clinical signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and is strongly associated with cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The risk factor pattern for PAOD was different at baseline and after a mean follow-up of 11 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We consider routine ABI measurements and modification of risk factors necessary also in patients with asymptomatic PAOD </plain></SENT>
