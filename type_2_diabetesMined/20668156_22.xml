<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of literature on the CE of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> interventions recommended by the American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association (<z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi>) and published between January 1985 and May 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We categorized the strength of evidence about the CE of an intervention as strong, supportive, or uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CEs were classified as cost saving (more health benefit at a lower cost), very cost-effective (&lt;or=$25,000 per life year gained [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LYG</z:e>] or quality-adjusted life year [QALY]), cost-effective ($25,001 to $50,000 per <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LYG</z:e> or QALY), marginally cost-effective ($50,001 to $100,000 per <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LYG</z:e> or QALY), or not cost-effective (&gt;$100,000 per <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LYG</z:e> or QALY) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CE classification of an intervention was reported separately by country setting (U.S. or other developed countries) if CE varied by where the intervention was implemented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Costs were measured in 2007 U.S. dollars </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-six studies from 20 countries met the inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A large majority of the <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> recommended interventions are cost-effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found strong evidence to classify the following interventions as cost saving or very cost-effective: (I) Cost saving- 1) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitor</z:chebi> (ACEI) therapy for intensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> control compared with standard <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> control; 2) ACEI or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e>) compared with no ACEI or ARB treatment; 3) early <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5959">irbesartan</z:chebi> therapy (at the <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> stage) to prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e> compared with later treatment (at the macroalbuminuria stage); 4) comprehensive foot care to prevent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> compared with usual care; 5) multi-component interventions for diabetic risk factor control and early detection of complications compared with conventional insulin therapy for persons with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; and 6) multi-component interventions for diabetic risk factor control and early detection of complications compared with standard glycemic control for persons with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>(II) Very cost-effective- 1) intensive lifestyle interventions to prevent type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among persons with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> compared with standard lifestyle recommendations; 2) universal opportunistic screening for undiagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in African Americans between 45 and 54 years old; 3) intensive glycemic control as implemented in the UK Prospective <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study in persons with newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with conventional glycemic control; 4) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> therapy for secondary prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> compared with no <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> therapy; 5) counseling and treatment for smoking cessation compared with no counseling and treatment; 6) annual screening for diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> and ensuing treatment in persons with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with no screening; 7) annual screening for diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> and ensuing treatment in persons with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with no screening; and 8) immediate vitrectomy to treat diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> compared with deferred vitrectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Many interventions intended to prevent/control <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are cost saving or very cost-effective and supported by strong evidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Policy makers should consider giving these interventions a higher priority </plain></SENT>
