<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients attending an outpatient diabetic clinic at the Sultan Qaboos University Hospital between 2002 and 2003 were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 261 patients were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean overall age of the cohort was 50+/-13 years, and 57% were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proportion of subjects who had <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> was 27% (n=70; N=261) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The logistic regression model indicated that significant predictors for the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> include HbA(1c), log <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, and the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A one unit increase in HbA(1c) was associated with a 23% increase in the odds of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> (OR 1.23; 95% CI: 1.10-1.37; p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, patients that had a one unit increase in log <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> were 5.72 times more likely to develop <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> (OR 5.72; 95% CI: 1.86-17.59; p=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, patients who were hypertensive were 2.37 times more likely to have <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> (OR 2.37; 95% CI: 1.11-5.09; p=0.026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in this study was 27% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Significant predictors of <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> included HbA(1c), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, and the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
