<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We investigated how beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity or resistance are affected by the type of blood sample collected or choice of insulin assay and homeostatis model assessment (HOMA) calculator (http://www.dtu.ox.ac.uk) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Insulin was measured using 11 different assays in serum and 1 assay in heparinized plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fasting subjects with normoglycemia (n = 12), pre-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, i.e., impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (n = 18), or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 67) were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients treated with insulin or those who were insulin antibody-positive were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HOMA estimates were calculated using specific insulin (SI) or radioimmunoassay (RIA) calculators (version 2.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> values were within model (HOMA) limits but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> insulin results, as 4.3% were &lt;20 pmol/l and 1% were &gt;300 pmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>beta-Cell function derived from different insulin assays ranged from 67 to 122% (median) for those with normoglycemia (P = 0.026), from 89 to 138% for those with pre-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P = 0.990), and from 50 to 81% for those with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> ranged from 0.8 to 2.0 (P = 0.0007), from 1.9 to 3.2 (P = 0.842), and from 1.5 to 2.9 (P &lt; 0.0001), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This twofold variation in HOMA estimates from the various insulin assays studied in serum may be significant metabolically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Insulin was 15% lower in heparinized plasma (used in the original HOMA study) compared with serum, which is now more commonly used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>beta-Cell function differed by 11% and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> by 15% when estimates derived from specific insulin were calculated using the RIA rather than the SI calculator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: To enable comparison of HOMA estimates among individuals and different research studies, preanalytical factors and calculator selection should be standardized with insulin assays traceable to an insulin reference method procedure </plain></SENT>
