<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One hundred and one urban Indigenous Australians in Queensland voluntarily participated in a culturally appropriate lifestyle intervention programme based on improving physical activity and dietary intake; 44 had type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 11 had impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and 46 were euglycaemic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Efficacy of the intervention on biochemical and physical markers of cardiovascular outcome will be monitored over 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diabetic subjects were overweight with good but suboptimal control of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> (mean systolic blood pressure 132 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure 85 mmHg, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> 2.8mM and urine albumin to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio 10.8) at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the 6 months follow up, there were significant reductions in waist circumference (3.1cm, P=0.01) and diastolic blood pressure (4.6 mmHg, P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although modest, these changes may improve clinical outcome if sustained </plain></SENT>
