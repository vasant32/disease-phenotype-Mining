<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The regulation of SSAO production remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied correlations between plasma SSAO activity and parameters associated with diabetic late complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Plasma SSAO was measured in a well-characterised group of 287 patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Standard statistical methods were used to investigate correlations with clinical parameters and components of the renin-angiotensin system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, plasma SSAO was elevated, at 693+/-196 mU/l (mean+/-SD; <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls 352+/-102 mU/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma SSAO was higher in the group with late complications or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and in patients treated with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE-inhibitors</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In univariate analysis a significant positive correlation (p&lt;0.001, r=0.27) was found between plasma SSAO and serum ACE activity in patients untreated with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitors</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> (n=221), but plasma SSAO did not differ by ACE I/D genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Plasma SSAO correlated positively with duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, HbA(1)c and plasma renin, and negatively with plasma angiotensinogen and body mass index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A multiple regression analysis including these variables resulted in serum ACE activity (p&lt;0.001), ACE genotype (negatively, p&lt;0.001) and HbA(1)c (p=0.023) as explaining variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Results suggest that a common factor is involved in the regulation of both plasma SSAO and serum ACE, which is different from the genetic determination of ACE activity </plain></SENT>
