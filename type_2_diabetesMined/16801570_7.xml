<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The Medical Outcome Study Short Form with 36 items (SF-36) was administered to 4,051 individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were enrolled in the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">Lipids</z:chebi> in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study, and their best attainable vision was determined using an Early Treatment of Diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>Retinopathy</z:hpo> Study chart, expressed as a LogMAR score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight domain scores and a utility value representing an overall quality-of-life score were calculated using predefined algorithms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The associations between quality of life measured and best-eye visual acuity were assessed graphically and by regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> eight SF-36 domain scores were negatively associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000505'>reduced visual acuity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The impact of lower levels of visual acuity ranged from a decline of 1.3 units for a 0.1-LogMAR increase for physical functioning and 0.6 units in mental health </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Regression analysis indicated a negative association (P &lt; 0.001) between utility and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000505'>reduced visual acuity</z:hpo> after controlling for sex, BMI, smoking status, and history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients whose LogMAR scores equated to legally blind had, on average, 0.054 (95% CI 0.034-0.074) lower utility compared with patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> visual acuity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000505'>Reduced visual acuity</z:hpo> is negatively associated with quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The utility scores estimated here should inform studies quantifying the burden of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and those evaluating potential therapies for treating or preventing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011869" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic eye diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
