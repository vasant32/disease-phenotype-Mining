<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to replicate these associations in Han Chinese individuals and to identify the potential mechanisms underlying these associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The single nucleotide polymorphisms rs780094 and rs1799884 were genotyped in a population-based sample of Han Chinese individuals (n = 3,210) and tested for association with risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and related phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The GCKR rs780094 A allele was marginally associated with reduced risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.73-1.00, p value under an additive model [p((add))] = 0.05) and significantly associated with reduced risk of impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (IFG) or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.77-0.96, p([add]) = 0.0032) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was also significantly associated with decreased fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and increased HOMA of beta cell function (HOMA-B) and fasting triacylglycerol levels (p([add]) = 0.0169-5.3 x 10(-6)), but not with HOMA of insulin sensitivity (HOMA-S) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The associations with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and IFG remained significant after adjustment for BMI, while adjustment for HOMA-B abolished the associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The GCKR rs780094 was also associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and BMI, independently of its association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The GCK rs1799884 A allele was significantly associated with decreased HOMA-B (p([add]) = 0.0005), but not with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or IFG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Individuals with increasing numbers of risk alleles for both variants had significantly lower HOMA-B (p([add]) = 5.8 x 10(-5)) in the combined analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Consistent with observations in white Europeans, the GCKR rs780094 polymorphism contributes to the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidaemia</z:e> in Han Chinese individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, we showed that the effect on type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is probably mediated through impaired beta cell function rather than through <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
