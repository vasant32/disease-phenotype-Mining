<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>While the advantages of the two basal insulin analogues, glargine and detemir, over neutral protamine Hagedorn are well established, the relative merit of the two compared with each other has been a matter of some controversy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The two analogues are popularly perceived to differ from each other in their pharmacodynamic (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>) profiles, in particular with regard to 'flatness' and duration of action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this review, therefore, is to give a complete overview on the available <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> data of both analogues as derived with the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> clamp technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to improve parity across studies, a common definition for duration of action (time from injection to plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &gt;8.3 mmol/l) was applied and study data were recalculated when necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Despite differences in methodological details, the results of most clamp studies were very consistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Glargine and detemir both typically show a gentle rise and fall in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering action over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Duration of action with both analogues is dose dependent, but in the clinically relevant range of 0.35-0.8 U/kg it is close to 24 h in people with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and in excess of this in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While both analogues seem to be very similar with regard to the mean shape of their <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> profile and duration of action, detemir shows less within-subject variability in its metabolic effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings in experimental <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> clamp studies are consistent with observations in clinical trials and support routine once daily use with either analogue, in particular in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
