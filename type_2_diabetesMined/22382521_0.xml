<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is why the paper of Shields et al in the current issue of Diabetologia is so warmly welcomed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MODY is the most common form of monogenic <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the optimal way of identifying MODY families still poses a challenge both for researchers and clinicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hattersley's group in Exeter, UK, have developed an easy-to-use MODY prediction model that can help to identify cases appropriate for genetic testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By answering eight simple questions on the internet ( www.diabetesgenes.org/content/mody-probability-calculator ), the doctor receives a positive predictive value in return: the probability that the patient has MODY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, the classical binary (yes/no) assessment provided by clinical diagnostic criteria has been substituted by a more rational, quantitative estimate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The model appears to discriminate well between MODY and type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> when <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is diagnosed before the age of 35Â years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the performance of the MODY probability calculator should now be validated in other settings than where it was developed-and, as always, there is room for some improvements and modifications </plain></SENT>
