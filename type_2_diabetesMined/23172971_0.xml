<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We used data from the three surveys of the Nord-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Tr</z:e>øndelag Health Study, spanning 1984-2008 and including a cohort of 90,819 Norwegian men (48%) and women (52%) aged ≥20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Incident cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were identified by questionnaire and classified as type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 1,860) and autoimmune <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 140) based on antibodies to glutamic decarboxylase (GADA) and age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hazard ratios (HRs) adjusted for confounders were estimated by Cox proportional hazards regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS The risk of autoimmune <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was reduced by 48% (HR 0.52 [95% CI 0.30-0.89]) in current smokers and 58% in heavy smokers (0.42 [0.18-0.98]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The reduced risk was positively associated with number of pack-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Heavy smoking was associated with lower levels of GADA (P = 0.001) and higher levels of C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (964 vs. 886 pmol/L; P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, smoking was associated with an increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, restricted to overweight men (1.33 [1.10-1.61]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Attributable proportion due to an interaction between overweight and heavy smoking was estimated to 0.40 (95% CI 0.23-0.57) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS In this epidemiological study, smoking is associated with a reduced risk of autoimmune <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, possibly linked to an inhibitory effect on the autoimmune process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was restricted to overweight men </plain></SENT>
