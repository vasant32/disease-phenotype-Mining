<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We measured blood perfusion with a microsphere technique in anesthetized animals and subsequently estimated the blood flow to seven different WAT depots and brown adipose tissue, in addition to the whole pancreas and pancreatic islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both GK and OZ rats had higher islet blood perfusion than their respective control strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adipose tissue blood flow (ATBF) was similar to or lower than that of controls in the normoglycemic OZ rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>GK rats, however, had 5-10 times higher blood perfusion than control Wistar rats in most WAT depots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vascular density and macrophage numbers in WAT did not differ between the different strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The discrepancy in ATBF between the <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>-normoglycemic and type 2 diabetic rats opens the intriguing possibility that changes in this blood perfusion may influence and/or modulate the <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta-cell dysfunction</z:hpo> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
