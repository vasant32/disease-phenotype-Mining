<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated associations of circulating metabolites from high-throughput profiling with fasting and postload glycemia cross-sectionally and prospectively on the population level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance was assessed in two Finnish, population-based studies consisting of 1,873 individuals (mean age 52 years, 58% women) and reexamined after 6.5 years for 618 individuals in one of the cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Metabolites were quantified by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy from fasting serum samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Associations were studied by linear regression models adjusted for established risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nineteen circulating metabolites, including amino acids, gluconeogenic substrates, and fatty acid measures, were cross-sectionally associated with fasting and/or postload <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among these metabolic intermediates, branched-chain amino acids, phenylalanine, and Î±1-acid <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> were predictors of both fasting and 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> at 6.5-year follow-up (P &lt; 0.05), whereas alanine, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi>, and tyrosine were uniquely associated with 6.5-year postload <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (P = 0.003-0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the fatty acid measures were prospectively associated with glycemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Changes in fatty acid concentrations were associated with changes in fasting and postload glycemia during follow-up; however, changes in branched-chain amino acids did not follow <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> dynamics, and gluconeogenic substrates only paralleled changes in fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Alterations in branched-chain and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33856">aromatic amino acid</z:chebi> metabolism precede <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further, alanine, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> were predictive of postchallenge <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> exclusively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These gluconeogenic precursors are potential markers of long-term impaired insulin sensitivity that may relate to attenuated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance later in life </plain></SENT>
