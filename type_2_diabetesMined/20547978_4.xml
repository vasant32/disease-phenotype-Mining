<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess whether overfeeding induces peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in lean and overweight humans, and, if so, whether it is associated with increased systemic and adipose tissue <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Thirty-six healthy individuals undertook 28 days of overfeeding by +1,250 kcal/day (45% fat) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Weight, body composition, insulin sensitivity (hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp), serum and gene expression of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> markers, immune cell activation, fat cell size, macrophage and T-cell numbers in abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry) were assessed at baseline and after 28 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Subjects gained 2.7 +/- 1.6 kg (P &lt; 0.001) and increased fat mass by 1.1 +/- 1.6% (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity decreased by 11% from 54.6 +/- 18.7 to 48.9 +/- 15.7 micromol/(kg of FFM)/min (P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a significant increase in circulating C-reactive protein (P = 0.002) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (P = 0.01), but no change in interleukin-6 and intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no changes in fat cell size, the number of adipose tissue macrophages or T-cells, or inflammatory gene expression and no change in circulating immune cell number or expression of their surface activation markers after overfeeding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>Weight gain</z:mp>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> was observed in the absence of a significant inflammatory state, suggesting that <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in subcutaneous adipose tissue occurs subsequent to peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in humans </plain></SENT>
