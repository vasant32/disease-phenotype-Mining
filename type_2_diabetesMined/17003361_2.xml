<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>African Americans have twice the prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> as Caucasians and much greater genetic diversity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We identified an inframe insertion of a proline in the insulin promoter factor 1 (IPF1) gene (InsCCG243), which was relatively common (minor allele frequency approximately 0.08) in African Americans and showed a trend to association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in preliminary studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An earlier French study identified InsCCG243 as a cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To determine the role of this variant in African Americans, we examined an additional population from North Carolina (n = 368) and a subset of African-American participants from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Risk in Communities (ARIC) study (n = 1,741) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also looked for segregation in 66 African-American families and for a role in insulin secretion in 112 nondiabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>InsCCG243 did not increase the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P = 0.16 in North Carolina; P = 0.97 in the ARIC study) and did not segregate with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, we found suggestive evidence for reduced insulin response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (P = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neither indirect measures of beta-cell mass nor beta-cell compensation were altered (P &gt; 0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>InsCCG243 does not act in a dominant, highly penetrant fashion in African Americans and is not a significant risk factor for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in this population </plain></SENT>
