<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the association of variants in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15889">sterol</z:chebi> regulatory element-binding factor 1 gene (SREBF1) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Due to the previous inconclusive quantitative trait associations, we also did studies of intermediate quantitative phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We genotyped four variants in SREBF1 in the population-based Inter99 cohort (n = 6,070), the Danish ADDITION study (n = 8,662), and in additional type 2 diabetic patients (n = 1,002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The case-control studies involved 2,980 type 2 diabetic patients and 4,522 glucose-tolerant subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The minor alleles of rs2297508, rs11868035, and rs1889018 (linkage disequilibrium R(2) = 0.6-0.8) associated with a modestly increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (rs2297508: OR 1.17 [95% CI 1.05-1.30], P = 0.003), which was confirmed in meta-analyses of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> published studies (rs2297508 G-allele: 1.08 [1.03-1.14] per allele, P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-associated alleles also associated strongly with a higher plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> at 30 and 120 min and serum insulin at 120 min during an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.006) and the minor allele of rs1889018 with a surrogate measure of insulin sensitivity (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-associated alleles associated with a modestly increased A1C level in the population-based Inter99 of middle-aged subjects and in the ADDITION study of high-risk individuals (P = 0.006 and P = 0.008, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We associate sequence variation in SREBF1 with a modestly increased predisposition to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the general population, the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-associated alleles are discreetly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> presumably due to decreased insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15889">sterol</z:chebi> regulatory element-binding protein-1c is a mediator of insulin action, the findings are consistent with the presence of a yet undefined subtle loss-of-function SREBF1 variant </plain></SENT>
