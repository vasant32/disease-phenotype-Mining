<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The glycaemic control of thrice daily treatment with premixed biphasic insulin aspart (BIAsp) without other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> therapy was tested in type 2 diabetic patients, in order to compare the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control of a 'high' mixture (BIAsp 70) or a 'medium' mixture (BIAsp 50) (70 or 50% soluble IAsp and 30 or 50% protamine-crystallized IAsp, respectively) administered just before dinner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To compare these regimens to conventional 30 : 70 premixture on a twice a day basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, two-period crossover study included 16 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty four-hour serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin profiles were obtained thrice: (1) after a one-week run-in period with biphasic human insulin (BHI) 30/70 twice daily (run-in), (2) after 4 weeks of treatment with thrice daily BIAsp 70 before breakfast, lunch and dinner (Dinner70 regimen) and (3) after 4 weeks of BIAsp 70 before breakfast and lunch and BIAsp 50 before dinner (Dinner50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Daytime average serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was lower with Dinner70 compared to run-in (9.6 +/- 0.39 mmol/l vs. 11.2 +/- 0.61 mmol/l, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excursions after breakfast and lunch were lower, but fasting morning <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was higher during the treatment periods than in the run-in period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty four-hour C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> AUC was considerably lower during both treatment periods than in the run-in period (run-in/Dinner50 ratio 1.29 [1.08; 1.54] p &lt; 0.01; run-in/Dinner70 ratio 1.31 [1.08;1.58], p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Switching the dinner dose to BIAsp 50 did not alter overall <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control significantly from that provided with BIAsp 70 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Exploratory analyses between the two active treatment regimens and run-in/BHI indicate that thrice daily BIAsp 70 administration: (1) for optimization of the night-time control, the dinner dose needs adjustment or replacement by a premixed insulin with a larger proportion of basal insulin than BIAsp 50 and (2) none of the premixtures adequately provide for both the evening meal and overnight requirements </plain></SENT>
