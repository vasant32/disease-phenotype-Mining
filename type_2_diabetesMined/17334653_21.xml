<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The association between increased (visceral) fat mass, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> is well known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Yet, it is unclear whether the mere increase in intra-abdominal fat mass, or rather functional alterations in fat tissue in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> contribute to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we attempted to isolate the metabolic effect of increased fat mass by fat tissue transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Epididymal fat pads were removed from male C57Bl6/J mice and transplanted intraperitoneally into male littermates (recipients), increasing the combined perigonadal fat mass by 50% (p &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 4 and 8 weeks post-transplantation, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin tolerance tests were performed, and insulin, NEFA and adipokines measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Circulating levels of NEFA, adiponectin and leptin were not significantly different between transplanted and sham-operated control mice, while results of the postprandial insulin tolerance test were similar between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, under fasting conditions, the mere increase in intra-abdominal fat mass resulted in decreased plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels (6.9 +/- 0.4 vs 8.1 +/- 0.3 mmol/l, p = 0.03) and a approximately 20% lower AUC in the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (p = 0.02) in transplanted mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-IR) was 4.1 +/- 0.4 in transplanted mice (vs 6.2 +/- 0.7 in sham-operated controls) (p = 0.02), suggesting improved insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Linear regression modelling revealed that while total body weight positively correlated, as expected, with HOMA-IR (beta: 0.728, p = 0.006), higher transplanted fat mass correlated with lower HOMA-IR (beta: -0.505, p = 0.031) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Increasing intra-abdominal fat mass by transplantation of fat from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mice improved, rather than impaired, fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance and insulin sensitivity, achieving an effect opposite to the expected metabolic consequence of increased visceral fat in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
