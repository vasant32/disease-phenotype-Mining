<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between atherotic (structural) and sclerotic (functional) changes in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Aortic distensibility and carotid intimal-media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) were evaluated using carotid-femoral aortic pulse-wave velocity (a-PWV) and high-resolution B-mode ultrasonography in 271 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 285 age-matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: a-PWV and carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> were significantly higher in the patients than in the control subjects in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> age-groups (P &lt; 0.0001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> and a-PWV were significantly correlated with age in both the patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a significant positive relationship between the carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> and a-PWV in both the patients (r = 0.482, P &lt; 0.0001) and control subjects (r = 0.424, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The slope of the regression line for the carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> to the a-PWV was significantly steeper in the diabetic patients than in the control subjects (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multiple regression analysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects showed that age, diabetic state, and cigarette smoking were independently common risk factors for the increase in carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> and a-PWV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the diabetic patients, the independent risk factors associated with the carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> were age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, and duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (R2 = 0.232, P &lt; 0.0001), while those associated with a-PWV were age and duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (R2 = 0.334, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that diabetic patients showed more advanced changes in atherosis than that in <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> as compared with age- and sex-matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Such atherotic changes in diabetic patients may be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
