<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: LVH was assessed using ECG criteria (Cornell product and/or Sokolow-Lyon voltage) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The risk of renal or CV events was determined by a proportional hazards model fit with treatment allocation and presence of LVH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Covariates at baseline included age, sex, systolic BP, mean arterial pressure, pulse, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo>, serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, albumin and <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 187 subjects (12%) had LVH at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> resulted in a significant decrease in the Cornell product (-6.2%) and Sokolow-Lyon voltage (-6.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LVH was shown to be significantly associated with the primary endpoint, which was a composite of doubling of serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> (DSCR), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>endstage renal disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (hazard ratio [HR]=1.44, p=0.011), as well as with the composite renal endpoint of DSCR/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e> (HR=1.42, p=0.031) and CV events (HR=1.68, p=0.001) </plain></SENT>
