<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After starting insulin, people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> that is poorly controlled with oral agents typically report improved well-being and treatment satisfaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, healthcare professionals and people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are often reluctant to begin insulin treatment, citing concerns such as time/resources needed to educate patients, increased risks of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> and fear of injections, which lead them to focus on intensifying conventional oral therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Insulin glargine, which offers people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> a once-a-day injection regimen with low risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e>, is more likely to overcome such initial barriers than other more complex insulin regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Once-daily insulin glargine, in combination with modern <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent oral agents that do not need to be chased with food to prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e>, does not require the fixed mealtimes and set amounts of carbohydrates necessary with twice-daily injection mixes and older sulphonylureas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We know that it is such dietary restrictions that cause the most damage to quality of life (QoL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To avoid damaging QoL unnecessarily and to ensure optimal satisfaction with treatment, it is important to evaluate the effects of treatment on QoL, treatment satisfaction and other patient-reported outcomes (PROs) using questionnaires validated for this purpose, such as the widely used <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire and the Audit of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp>-Dependent Quality of Life measure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A systematic electronic literature search identified reports of studies evaluating PROs associated with insulin glargine in comparison with other treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The studies show that insulin glargine is usually associated with greater improvements in treatment satisfaction and other PROs compared with intensifying oral therapy or alternative insulin regimens </plain></SENT>
