<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using a cell-trapping system, we have obtained an insulin-secreting cell clone from undifferentiated ES cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The construction used allows the expression of a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7507">neomycin</z:chebi> selection system under the control of the regulatory regions of the human insulin gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The chimeric gene also contained a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24753">hygromycin</z:chebi> resistance gene (pGK-hygro) to select transfected cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A resulting clone (IB/3x-99) containing 16.5 ng/microg protein of total insulin displays regulated hormone secretion in vitro in the presence of various secretagogues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clusters obtained from this clone were implanted (1 x 10(6) cells) in the spleen of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi>-induced diabetic animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transplanted animals correct <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> within 1 week and restore body weight in 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Whereas an intraperitoneal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test showed a slower recovery in transplanted versus control mice, blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> normalization after a challenge meal was similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This approach opens new possibilities for tissue transplantation in the treatment of type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and offers an alternative to gene therapy </plain></SENT>
