<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genome-wide linkage scans have localized common regions, possibly harboring susceptibility genes on chromosomes 1, 2, 12, and 20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Variability in linkage findings underscores the probable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, we conducted a genome scan of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> status using maximum likelihood methods that model affection status by a liability threshold model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hypertensive sibships and their offspring and/or parents in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> Genetic Epidemiology Network study were recruited from five field centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> phenotype was derived using the World Health Organization criteria and adjusted for race/study center, age, age2, sex, and with and without percent body fat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In total, 567 diabetic participants were identified in 437 families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Variance component linkage analysis was performed among 1,545 Caucasians and 1,608 African Americans using race-specific marker allele frequencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We detected a quantitative trait loci (QTLs) influencing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> variance (logarithm of odds = 3.4) on chromosome 22, which overlaps a positive type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> finding among Canadian Oji-Cree Indians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We also observed suggestive evidence for linkage on chromosomes 1, 2, 5, 8, 14, 17, and 19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The identification and replication of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> QTLs will bring us closer to the detection of functional genes that influence <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility </plain></SENT>
