<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent research suggests that the Pro12Ala variant in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma2 (PPAR-gamma2) is associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>- and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-related traits, and that its effects may be modified by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We characterized this variant in a population-based sample of 1,441 middle-aged African-American individuals with respect to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-, and other cardiovascular-related traits, both cross-sectionally and prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The overall frequency of Ala12 was 1.9% (95% CI 1.5-2.5%), significantly lower than in Caucasian populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Consistent with previous findings in Caucasians, African Americans with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> tended to be less likely to have the Pro/Ala genotype than those without (odds ratio [OR] 0.64, 95% CI 0.34-1.20); however, this OR was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among nonobese individuals, the Pro/Ala genotype was associated with significantly lower ln(insulin) (P = 0.001), lower ln(HOMA-IR) (homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>) (P = 0.002), higher fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-to-insulin ratio (P = 0.005), and lower diastolic blood pressure (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among overweight individuals (BMI 25-29.9 kg/m(2)), the Pro/Ala genotype was associated with greater BMI (P = 0.02), waist-to-hip ratio (P = 0.01), and waist circumference (P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals, there was no association between any of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>- or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-related traits and the Pro12Ala PPAR-gamma2 variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that among nonobese African Americans, the Pro/Ala genotype is associated with markers of greater insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
