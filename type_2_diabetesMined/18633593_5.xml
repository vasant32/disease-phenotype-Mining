<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied performance of the traditional '186' Modification of Diet in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Renal Disease</z:e> (MDRD) equation, and the 2005 revised '175' MDRD equation in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two hundred and ninety-three mainly normoalbuminuric (267/293) patients were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified as having mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal impairment</z:e> (group 1, GFR &lt;90 ml min(-1) 1.73 m(-2)) or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> renal function (group 2, GFR &gt;or=90 ml min(-1) 1.73 m(-2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>eGFR was calculated by the traditional 186 MDRD equation using traditional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> values and the revised 175 MDRD equation using isotope dilution mass spectrometry-standardised <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Isotopic GFR was measured by the four-sample plasma clearance of (51)Cr-EDTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For patients in group 1, mean +/- SD isotopic (51)Cr-EDTA GFR (iGFR) was 83.8 +/- 4.3 ml min(-1) 1.73 m(-2), and eGFR was 73.2 +/- 11.9 and 75.8 +/- 13.7 ml min(-1) 1.73 m(-2) using the 186 and 175 MDRD equations, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Method bias was -10.6 with the 186 MDRD and -7.9 ml min(-1) 1.73 m(-2) (p &lt; 0.05) with the 175 MDRD equation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In group 2, iGFR was 119.4 +/- 20.2 ml min(-1) 1.73 m(-2), and eGFR was 92.3 +/- 18.6 and 97.5 +/- 21.6 ml min(-1) 1.73 m(-2) using the 186 and 175 MDRD equations, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Method bias was -27.1 with the 186 MDRD equation and -21.9 ml min(-1) 1.73 m(-2) (p &lt; 0.05) with the 175 MDRD equation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In patients newly diagnosed with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the revised 175 MDRD equation was less biased than the traditional 186 MDRD equation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Despite a continued tendency to underestimate isotopically measured GFR, use of standardised <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> values is a positive step towards improved estimation of GFR </plain></SENT>
