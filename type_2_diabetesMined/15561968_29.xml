<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The examination of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for both <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>- and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related traits and their responses to a high-fat diet can be effectively addressed in mouse model systems, including LGXSM recombinant inbred (RI) mouse strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A wide range of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>- and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related traits were measured in animals from 16 RI strains with 8 animals of each sex fed a high- or low-fat diet from each strain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Marker associations were measured at 506 microsatellite markers spread throughout the mouse genome using a nested ANOVA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Locations with significant effects on the traits themselves and/or trait dietary responses were identified after correction for multiple comparisons by limiting the false detection rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nonsyntenic associations of marker genotypes were common at QTL locations so that the significant results were limited to loci still significant in multiple QTL models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We discovered 91 QTLs at 39 locations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Many of these locations (n = 31) also showed genetic effects on dietary response, typically because the loci produced significantly larger effects on the high-fat diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fat depot weights, leptin levels, and body weight at necropsy tended to map to the same locations and were responsible for a majority of the dietary response QTLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Basal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels and the response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> challenge mapped together in locations distinct from those affecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These QTL locations form a panel for further research and fine mapping of loci affecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>- and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related traits and their responses to high-fat feeding </plain></SENT>
