<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested whether a renal arterial resistance index (R/I) &gt; or =80, using Doppler ultrasound technique, was predictive of worsening renal function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary end points of the study were 1) the course of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and 2) the albumin excretion rate in 157 microalbuminuric, hypertensive, type 2 diabetic patients after a 7.8-year follow-up period (range 7.1-9.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier curves for the primary end point (decrease of GFR &gt; or = -3.0 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) per year) was two to three times more frequently observed in patients with R/I &gt; or =80 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four- to fivefold fewer patients showed a regression to normoalbuminuria during the follow-up period from baseline <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> in the cohort with R/I &gt; or =80 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> did develop in 24% of patients with R/I &gt; or =80 and in 5% of patients with R/I &lt;80 (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, intrarenal arterial resistance appears to play a nontrivial role in deteriorating renal function in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>R/I is a noninvasive diagnostic procedure, which strongly predicts the outcome of renal function in type 2 diabetic patients, even when GFR patterns are still <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
