<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Instead, we aimed to compare diets that were available during human evolution with more recently introduced ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-nine patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischaemic heart disease</z:e> plus either <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were randomised to receive (1) a Palaeolithic ('Old Stone Age') diet (n = 14), based on lean meat, fish, fruits, vegetables, root vegetables, eggs and nuts; or (2) a Consensus (Mediterranean-like) diet (n = 15), based on whole grains, low-fat dairy products, vegetables, fruits, fish, oils and margarines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Primary outcome variables were changes in weight, waist circumference and plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> AUC (AUC <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi>(0-120)) and plasma insulin AUC (AUC Insulin(0-120)) in OGTTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over 12 weeks, there was a 26% decrease of AUC <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi>(0-120) (p = 0.0001) in the Palaeolithic group and a 7% decrease (p = 0.08) in the Consensus group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The larger (p = 0.001) improvement in the Palaeolithic group was independent (p = 0.0008) of change in waist circumference (-5.6 cm in the Palaeolithic group, -2.9 cm in the Consensus group; p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the study population as a whole, there was no relationship between change in AUC <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi>(0-120) and changes in weight (r = -0.06, p = 0.9) or waist circumference (r = 0.01, p = 1.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a tendency for a larger decrease of AUC Insulin(0-120) in the Palaeolithic group, but because of the strong association between change in AUC Insulin(0-120) and change in waist circumference (r = 0.64, p = 0.0003), this did not remain after multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: A Palaeolithic diet may improve <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance independently of decreased waist circumference </plain></SENT>
