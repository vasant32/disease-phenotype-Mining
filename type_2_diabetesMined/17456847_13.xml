<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have an impaired ability to switch appropriately between carbohydrate and fatty acid oxidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, whether this is a cause or consequence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> is unclear, and the mechanism(s) involved in this response is not completely elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whole-body fat oxidation and transcriptional regulation of genes involved in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism in skeletal muscle were measured after a prolonged fast and after consumption of either high-fat (76%) or high-carbohydrate (76%) meals in individuals with no family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (control, n = 8) and in age- and fatness-matched individuals with a strong family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Vastus lateralis muscle biopsies were performed before and 3 h after each meal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity and fasting measures of fat oxidation were not different between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, subjects with a family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had an impaired ability to increase fatty acid oxidation in response to the high-fat meal (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was related to impaired activation of genes involved in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism, including those for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor coactivator-1alpha (PGC1alpha) and fatty acid translocase (FAT)/CD36 (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of interest, adiponectin receptor-1 expression decreased 23% after the high-fat meal in both groups, but it was not changed after the high-carbohydrate meal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, an impaired ability to increase fatty acid oxidation precedes the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in genetically susceptible individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PGC1alpha and FAT/CD36 are likely candidates in mediating this response </plain></SENT>
