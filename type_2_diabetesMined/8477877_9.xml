<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> which is normally coexpressed with insulin in beta cells, forms amyloid deposits especially in islets of Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Occurrence of islet amyloid is paradoxically associated with loss of islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> immunoreactivity in beta cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was undertaken to examine whether the islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> gene is expressed in islets with decreased islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> immunoreactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pancreatic tissue from 14 patients, 7 with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 7 non-diabetic, were obtained at autopsy or surgery and studied for islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> expression by in situ hybridization and for presence of insulin and islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six of the specimens from the diabetic and three of those from the non-diabetic patients had varying degrees of islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi>-derived islet amyloid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Amyloid deposits were associated with decreased numbers of beta cells with islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> immunoreactivity despite an apparent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> frequency of insulin-containing cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This discrepancy might reflect an alteration in islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> production or processing at a transcriptional or post-transcriptional level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the varying immunohistochemical patterns, islets of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> categories showed strong labelling using an islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> probe for in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> production is not altered at the transcriptional level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The following possibilities remain: (1) islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> production may be altered at a post-transcriptional level or (2) that islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> production is <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> but the reduced immunoreactivity of the cells reflects a reduced storage of IAPP in secretory granules.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
