<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To further investigate this finding, we analysed three SNPs, rs2237895, rs2237897 and rs2283228, within the KCNQ1 locus for association with <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> among Chinese type 2 diabetic patients residing in Singapore </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>Albuminuria</z:mp> was analysed as both categorical (micro- and macroalbuminuria) and continuous traits (log(e) albumin/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio [ACR]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 752 Chinese patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>Albuminuria</z:mp> was determined by ACR using spot urine samples, and renal function was approximated using estimated GFR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genotyping was performed using invader and Taqman assays as appropriate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate regression analyses were used to analyse the associations between SNPs and renal traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant associations were detected between rs2283228 and macroalbuminuria (p &lt; 0.001, corrected p &lt; 0.01), as well as log(e) ACR (p = 0.004, corrected p = 0.036) after multiple hypothesis testing and adjustment for potential confounding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A trend of increasing OR was observed with increasing severity of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> (low and high <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp>, macroalbuminuria) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>rs2237897, previously implicated in the earlier Japanese study, was also associated with macroalbuminuria, but this finding did not remain significant after correction for multiple testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Meta-analyses of the Chinese and Japanese studies revealed both SNPs to be significantly associated with macroalbuminuria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Together with the previous Japanese study, our findings support the hypothesis that, in addition to KCNQ1 being an established type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> gene, genetic variation in this gene may contribute to susceptibility to diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in East Asians </plain></SENT>
