<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a parallel-group population-based cohort study including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> men and women aged 40-65 years, free of known <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, registered with a single practice in Ely, UK (n = 4,936) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 1990-1992, approximately one-third (n = 1,705) were randomly selected to receive an invitation to screening for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (with an OGTT) and related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the remaining two-thirds of the population, 1,705 individuals were randomly selected for invitation to screening in 2000-2003 and 1,526 were not invited at any point during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> individuals were flagged for mortality until January 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 345 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> between 1990 and 1999 (median 10 years follow-up) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with those not invited, individuals who were invited to the 1990-1992 screening round had a non-significant 21% lower <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality (HR 0.79 [95% CI 0.63-1.00], p = 0.05) after adjustment for age, sex and deprivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 291 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> between 2000 and 2008 (median 8 years follow-up), with no significant difference in mortality between invited and non-invited participants in 2000-2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with the non-invited group, participants who attended for screening at any time point had a significantly lower mortality and those who did not attend had a significantly higher mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Invitation to screening was associated with a non-significant reduction in mortality in the Ely cohort between 1990 and 1999, but this was not replicated in the period 2000-2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study contributes to the evidence concerning the potential benefits of population screening for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
