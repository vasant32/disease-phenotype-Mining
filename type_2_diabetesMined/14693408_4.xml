<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the influence of the Arg16Gly variant allele of B2AR on insulin secretion in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used minimal model analysis of the frequently sampled insulin-modified intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (FSIGT) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism to examine differences of insulin secretion and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> among three genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in baseline clinical characteristics, HbA1c, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi>, CRP or <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profiles among the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Gly/Gly group had significantly higher levels of fasting insulin (38.2+/-4.7 pmol/l versus 23.6+/-3.5 pmol/l) and homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-R) (1.90+/-0.19 versus 1.32+/-0.24), compared with the Arg/Arg group, but there were no significant differences in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (AIRg) bolus, insulin sensitivity (Si), or <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> effectiveness (Sg) among the three genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Several reports have speculated that the Gly16 allele of B2AR exhibits <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>-promoted downregulation, but our findings, elevated fasting insulin concentrations, and previous clinical studies of blood pressure and lypolysis are controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The direct mechanism by which the Gly16 allele of B2AR may influence insulin secretion of pancreatic beta-cells is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further studies of the expression of the allelic receptor in islet cells may help to resolve the role of B2AR in insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, increased sensitivity to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi>-induced lipolysis of the Gly allele promotes higher free fatty acids concentrations in the portal system, which could enhance the higher levels of fasting insulin </plain></SENT>
