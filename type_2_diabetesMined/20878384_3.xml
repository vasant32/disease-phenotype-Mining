<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two low-frequency, non-synonymous variants in HNF4A (V255M, minor allele frequency [MAF] ~0.1%; T130I, MAF ~3.0%)-known to influence downstream HNF-4A target gene expression-are of interest, but previous type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> association reports were inconclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to evaluate the contribution of these variants to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility through large-scale association analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We genotyped both variants in at least 5,745 cases and 14,756 population controls from the UK and Denmark </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also undertook an expanded association analysis that included previously reported and novel genotype data obtained in Danish, Finnish, Canadian and Swedish samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A meta-analysis incorporating <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> published association studies of the T130I variant was subsequently carried out in a maximum sample size of 14,279 cases and 26,835 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found no association between V255M and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in either the initial (p = 0.28) or the expanded analysis (p = 0.44) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, T130I demonstrated a modest association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the UK and Danish samples (additive per allele OR 1.17 [95% CI 1.08-1.28]; p = 1.5 × 10⁻⁴), which was strengthened in the meta-analysis (OR 1.20 [95% CI 1.10-1.30]; p = 2.1 × 10⁻⁵) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our data are consistent with T130I as a low-frequency variant influencing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk, but are not conclusive when judged against stringent standards for genome-wide significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study exemplifies the difficulties encountered in association testing of low-frequency variants </plain></SENT>
