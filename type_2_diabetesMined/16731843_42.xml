<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that Mfn2 gene expression is induced in skeletal muscle and brown adipose tissue by conditions associated with enhanced energy expenditure, such as cold exposure or beta(3)-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37886">adrenergic agonist</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In keeping with the role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi>)-1 alpha on energy expenditure, we demonstrate a stimulatory effect of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi>-1 alpha on Mfn2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression in muscle cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi>-1 alpha also stimulated the activity of the Mfn2 promoter, which required the integrity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>-related receptor-alpha (ERR alpha)-binding elements located at -413/-398 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ERR alpha also activated the transcriptional activity of the Mfn2 promoter, and the effects were synergic with those of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi>-1 alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mfn2 loss of function reduced the stimulatory effect of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi>-1 alpha on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Exposure to cold substantially increased Mfn2 gene expression in skeletal muscle from heterozygous Mfn2 knock-out mice, which occurred in the presence of higher levels of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi>-1 alpha <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> compared with control mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate the existence of a regulatory pathway involving <z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi>-1 alpha, ERR alpha, and Mfn2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Alterations in this regulatory pathway may participate in the pathophysiology of insulin-resistant conditions and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
