<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the degree to which alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, with their unique mode of action primarily reducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011998'>postprandial hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, offer an additional therapeutic approach in the long-term treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 1,946 patients (63% men) who were previously enrolled in the U.K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prospective <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study (UKPDS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were randomized to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> (n = 973), titrating to a maximum dose of 100 mg three times per day, or to matching placebo (n = 973) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean +/- SD age was 59 +/- 9 years, body weight 84 +/- 17 kg, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration 7.6 +/- 2.9 years, median (interquartile range) HbA1c 7.9% (6.7-9.5), and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) 8.7 mmol/l (6.8-11.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fourteen percent of patients were treated with diet alone, 52% with monotherapy, and 34% with combined therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were monitored in UKPDS clinics every 4 months for 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The main outcome measures were HbA1c, FPG, body weight, compliance with study medication, incidence of side effects, and frequency of major clinical events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At 3 years, a lower proportion of patients were taking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> compared with placebo (39 vs. 58%, P &lt; 0.0001), the main reasons for noncompliance being flatulence (30 vs. 12%, P &lt; 0.0001) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> (16 vs. 8%, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Analysis by intention to treat showed that patients allocated to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi>, compared with placebo, had 0.2% significantly lower median HbA1c at 3 years (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In patients remaining on their allocated therapy, the HbA1c difference at 3 years (309 acarbose, 470 placebo) was 0.5% lower median HbA1c (8.1 vs. 8.6%, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">Acarbose</z:chebi> appeared to be equally efficacious when given in addition to diet alone; in addition to monotherapy with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, or insulin; or in combination with more complex treatment regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were seen in FPG, body weight, incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>, or frequency of major clinical events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">Acarbose</z:chebi> significantly improved glycemic control over 3 years in patients with established type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, irrespective of concomitant therapy for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Careful titration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> is needed in view of the increased noncompliance rate seen secondary to the known side effects </plain></SENT>
