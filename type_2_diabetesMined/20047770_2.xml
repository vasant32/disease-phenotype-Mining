<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During 18 months, we performed a cluster randomized trial with randomization of General Practices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The usual QIP (UQIP: 53 GPs, 918 patients) merged standard interventions including evidence-based treatment protocol, annual benchmarking, postgraduate education, case-coaching for GPs and patient education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The advanced QIP (AQIP: 67 GPs, 1577 patients) introduced additional interventions focussing on intensified follow-up, shared care and patient behavioural changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Main outcomes were HbA1c, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>), analyzed by generalized estimating equations and linear mixed models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In UQIP, endpoints improved significantly after intervention: HbA1c -0.4%, 95% CI [-0.4; -0 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In AQIP, there were no significant additional improvements in outcomes: HbA1c -0.4%, 95% CI [-0.4; -0.3]; SBP -4mmHg, 95% CI [-5; -2]; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> -14mg/dl, 95% CI [-15; -11] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A multifaceted program merging standard interventions in support of general practice induced significant improvements in the quality of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intensified follow-up in AQIP with focus on shared care and patient behaviour changes did not yield additional benefit </plain></SENT>
