<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that genetic polymorphism in the promoter of resistin gene is a determinant of resistin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression and possibly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the association between the genotype of resistin promoter and its plasma concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined g.-537A&gt;C and g.-420C&gt;G polymorphisms in the resistin promoter and measured plasma resistin concentrations in Korean subjects with or without Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also did haplotype-based promoter activity assays and the gel electrophoretic mobility shift assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The -420G and the -537A alleles, which were in linkage disequilibrium, were associated with higher plasma resistin concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Individuals with haplotype A-G (-537A and -420G) had significantly higher plasma resistin concentrations than the others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Haplotype A-G had modestly increased promoter activity compared to the other haplotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that the -420G allele is specific for binding of nuclear proteins from adipocytes and monocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, none of the two polymorphisms were associated with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in our study subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Polymorphisms in the promoter of resistin gene are major determinants of plasma resistin concentrations in humans </plain></SENT>
