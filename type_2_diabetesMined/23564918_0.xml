<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CV risk factors, preexisting <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>, and NT-proBNP levels were evaluated at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo>-cause and CV mortality were assessed 5.5 years after baseline examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariate Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to estimate mortality hazard ratios (HRs).RESULTSDuring the follow-up period, 390 people died (175 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) out of 9,101 person-years of observations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A significantly increased mortality risk by quartiles of NT-proBNP was observed (test for trend, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>NT-proBN P values &gt;91 pg/mL conferred HRs of 2.05 (95% CI 1.47-2.86) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause and 4.47 (2.38-8.39) for CV mortality, independently of CV risk factors, including CRP and albumin excretion rate (AER) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The association was also significant for modest rises in NT-proBNP levels and in patients without <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> at baseline (upper quartiles HRs 3.82 [95% CI 1.24-13.75]) and 3.14 [1.00-9.94]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>Albuminuria</z:mp> and NT-proBNP had an additive effect on mortality, though the association was stronger for NT-proBNP.CONCLUSIONSNT-proBNP is a strong independent predictor of short-term CV mortality risk in elderly people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, including those without preexisting <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This association is evident even in people with slightly increased values, is not modified by CRP, and is additive to that provided by AER </plain></SENT>
