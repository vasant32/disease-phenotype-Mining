<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T1DM), information about the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> treatment on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020473" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lipidaemia</z:e> is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we report the effect of a 1-year treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> vs. placebo on plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> in T1DM patients and persistent poor glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred T1DM patients with haemoglobinA(1c) (HbA(1c)) &gt; or =8.5% during the year before enrolment entered a 1-month run-in period on placebo treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, patients were randomized (baseline) to treatment with either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (1000 mg twice daily) or placebo for 12 months (double masked) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients continued ongoing insulin therapy and their usual outpatient clinical care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Outcomes were assessed at baseline and after 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 1 year, in those patients who did not start or stop <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> therapy during the trial, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> treatment significantly reduced total and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> by approximately 0.3 mmol/l compared with placebo (p = 0.021 and p = 0.018 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adjustment for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> use or known <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> did not change conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> users (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>: n = 22, placebo: n = 13), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> significantly lowered levels of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> and non-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> by approximately 0.5 mmol/l compared with placebo (adjusted for changes in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> dose or agent: p = 0.048 and p = 0.033 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>HbA(1c) (previously reported) was not significant different between treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with poorly controlled T1DM, at similar glycaemic levels, adjunct <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> therapy during 1 year significantly lowered levels of proatherogenic cholesterolaemia independent of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
