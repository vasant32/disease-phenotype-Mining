<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study assessed the efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin monotherapy in Japanese T2DM patients with inadequate glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients (n = 279) were randomized to receive dapagliflozin (1, 2.5, 5 or 10 mg/day) or placebo once daily for 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was change from baseline in <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA1c) at week 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Secondary endpoints included change from baseline in fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) and proportion of patients achieving HbA1c &lt;7.0% at week 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant reductions in HbA1c were seen with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> dapagliflozin doses (-0.11 to -0.44%) versus placebo (+0.37%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reductions were also observed in FPG with dapagliflozin (-0.87 to -1.77 mmol/l [-15.61 to -31.94 mg/dl]) versus placebo (+0.62 mmol/l [+11.17 mg/dl]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant difference in the proportion of patients achieving HbA1c levels &lt;7.0% was noted with dapagliflozin versus placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adverse events (AEs) were more frequent with dapagliflozin (40.7-53.8%) versus placebo (38.9%) and were mostly mild/moderate in intensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three hypoglycaemic events were reported (1 each with placebo, dapagliflozin 2.5 mg and 10 mg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The frequency of signs and symptoms suggestive of urinary tract or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0729552" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genital infections</z:e> was 0-3.8 and 0-1.8% respectively with dapagliflozin and 1.9 and 0% with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No AEs of <z:mp ids='MP_0011403'>pyelonephritis</z:mp> were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Compared with placebo, dapagliflozin significantly reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> over 12 weeks with a low risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> in Japanese T2DM patients with inadequate glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
