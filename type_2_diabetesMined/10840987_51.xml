<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: There were 57 patients with well-controlled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> aged &lt;75 years treated with placebo for 4 weeks and then randomized to receive tomato juice (500 ml/day), vitamin E (800 U/day), <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> (500 mg/day), or continued placebo treatment for 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Susceptibility of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> to oxidation (lag time) and plasma concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15948">lycopene</z:chebi>, vitamin E, <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi>, C-RP, vascular cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule 1, and intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule 1 were measured at the beginning of the study, after the placebo phase, and at the end of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15948">lycopene</z:chebi> levels increased nearly 3-fold (P = 0.001), and the lag time in isolated <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> oxidation by copper ions increased by 42% (P = 0.001) in patients during supplementation with tomato juice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of this increase in lag time was comparable with the corresponding increase during supplementation with vitamin E (54%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma C-RP levels decreased significantly (-49%, P = 0.004) in patients who received vitamin E </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Circulating levels of cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules and plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> did not change significantly during the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that consumption of commercial tomato juice increases plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15948">lycopene</z:chebi> levels and the intrinsic resistance of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> to oxidation almost as effectively as supplementation with a high dose of vitamin E, which also decreases plasma levels of C-RP, a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings may be relevant to strategies aimed at reducing risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
