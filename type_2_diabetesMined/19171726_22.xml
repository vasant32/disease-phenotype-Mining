<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the within-trial cost-efficacy of surgical therapy relative to conventional therapy for achieving remission of recently diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in class I and II <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Efficacy results were derived from a 2-year randomized controlled trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A health sector perspective was adopted, and within-trial intervention costs included gastric banding surgery, mitigation of complications, outpatient medical consultations, medical investigations, pathology, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> therapies, and medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Resource use was measured based on data drawn from a trial database and patient medical records and valued based on private hospital costs and government schedules in 2006 Australian dollars (AUD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An incremental cost-effectiveness analysis was undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean 2-year intervention costs per patient were 13,400 AUD for surgical therapy and 3,400 AUD for conventional therapy, with laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (LAGB) surgery accounting for 85% of the difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Outpatient medical consultation costs were three times higher for surgical patients, whereas medication costs were 1.5 times higher for conventional patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cost differences were primarily in the first 6 months of the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Relative to conventional therapy, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for surgical therapy was 16,600 AUD per case of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> remitted (currency exchange: 1 AUD = 0.74 USD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Surgical therapy appears to be a cost-effective option for managing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in class I and II <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
