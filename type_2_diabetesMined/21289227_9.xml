<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine whether lower serum levels of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29191">(OH)</z:chebi> D [25(OH)D] are associated with increased risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A post hoc analysis of three nested case-control studies of fractures, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> that measured serum 25(OH)D levels in women participating in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Clinical Trials and Observational Study who were free of prevalent <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> was defined as self-report of physician diagnosis or receiving insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used inverse probability weighting to make the study population representative of the WHI population as a whole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Weighted logistic regression models compared 25(OH)D levels (divided into quartiles, clinical cut points [&lt;50, 50-&lt;75, â‰¥ 75 nmol/L], or as a continuous variable) using the distribution of control subjects and adjusted for multiple confounding factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 5,140 women (mean age 66 years) followed for an average of 7.3 years, 317 (6.2%) developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Regardless of the cut points used or as a continuous variable, 25(OH)D levels were not associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence in either age or fully adjusted models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nor was any relationship found between 25(OH)D and incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> when evaluated by strata of BMI, race/ethnicity, or randomization status in the Calcium <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">Vitamin D</z:chebi> trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Lower serum 25(OH)D levels were not associated with increased risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in this racially and ethnically diverse population of postmenopausal women </plain></SENT>
