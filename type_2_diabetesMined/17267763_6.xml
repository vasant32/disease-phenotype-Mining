<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we show that mice with liver-specific PDK1 deficiency manifest various defects in the metabolic actions of insulin in the liver as well as a type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-like phenotype characterized by marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011998'>postprandial hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The hepatic abundance of glucokinase, an important determinant of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> flux and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-evoked signaling in hepatocytes, was substantially reduced in these mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Restoration of hepatic glucokinase expression, with the use of an adenoviral vector, induced insulin-like effects in the liver and almost completely normalized the <z:hpo ids='HP_0008283'>fasting hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011998'>postprandial hyperglycemia</z:hpo> in these animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that, if the hepatic abundance of glucokinase is maintained, ingested <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> is normally disposed of even in the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> activation of proximal insulin signaling, such as the activation of Akt, in the liver </plain></SENT>
