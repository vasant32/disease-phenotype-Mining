<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The membrane protein plasma cell membrane <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-1 (PC-1) has been identified as an inhibitor of insulin receptor tyrosine kinase (IRTK) activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated insulin receptor function and PC-1 levels in muscle from three groups of <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects: women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e>, pregnant women with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, and nonpregnant control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects (n = 6 for each group) were similar in age and degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (body fat &gt;30%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IRTK activity, insulin receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, and protein levels of membrane <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> PC-1 were determined in rectus abdominus muscle biopsies obtained at the time of either elective cesarean section or gynecological surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were evident in basal insulin receptor tyrosine phosphorylation or IRTK activity in the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After maximal insulin (10(-7) mol/l) stimulation, IRTK activity measured with the artificial substrate poly(Glu,Tyr) increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects but was lower in women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> by 25% (P &lt; 0.05) and 39% (P &lt; 0.001) compared with pregnant and nonpregnant control subjects, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similarly, insulin receptor tyrosine phosphorylation was significantly decreased in subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> (P &lt; 0.05) compared with pregnant and nonpregnant control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment of the insulin receptors with alkaline phosphatase to dephosphorylate serine/threonine residues increased insulin-stimulated IRTK activity significantly in pregnant control and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> subjects (P &lt; 0.05), but these rates were still lower compared with nonpregnant control subjects (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PC-1 content in muscle from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> subjects was increased by 63% compared with pregnant control subjects (P &lt; 0.05) and by 206% compared with nonpregnant control subjects (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>PC-1 content was negatively correlated with insulin receptor phosphorylation (r = -0.55, P &lt; 0.05) and IRTK activity (r = -0.66, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that pregnant control and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> subjects had increased PC-1 content and suggest excessive phosphorylation of serine/threonine residues in muscle insulin receptors and that both may contribute to decreased IRTK activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These changes worsen in women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> when controlling for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These postreceptor defects in insulin signaling may contribute to the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> and the increased risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> later in life </plain></SENT>
