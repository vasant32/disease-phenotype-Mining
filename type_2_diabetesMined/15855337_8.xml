<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to characterize the development of end-organ damage in this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cohen diabetic sensitive (CDs) and Cohen diabetic resistant (CDr) rats were fed regular diet or a diabetogenic diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, renal function, and renal and <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> histology were studied at set intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CDs fed diabetogenic diet were the only strain that expressed the diabetic metabolic phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this strain, urinary protein excretion did not increase with the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but plasma <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> levels increased and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Light microscopy revealed in CDs enlarged glomeruli with increased mesangial matrix and thickening of the glomerular capillary wall; electron microscopy demonstrated thickened basement membrane and mesangial abundance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was increased staining for type IV collagen in glomeruli and interstitium of CDs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The retinas of diabetic CDs demonstrated pathology consistent with nonproliferative diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The histological findings in the kidneys, the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo>, the impairment in glomerular filtration, and the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> in CDs are consistent with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> that is similar to a nonalbuminuric type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in humans </plain></SENT>
