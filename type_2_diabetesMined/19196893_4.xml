<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In the Look AHEAD (Action for Health in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp>) Study, BMI and waist circumference were measured among 4,985 participants while total percent body fat was measured by whole-body DEXA scans among 1,351 participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Odds of <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> by quartiles of BMI, waist circumference, and percent total body fat were calculated using logistic regression analysis while adjusting for covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The highest quartile of BMI (odds ratio [OR] 1.72 [95% CI 1.40-2.11]) and waist circumference (OR 1.75 [95% CI 1.42-2.15]) was significantly associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> compared with the lowest quartile after adjustment for covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No associations were noted between quartiles of percent total body fat and <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> in any model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mp ids='MP_0006087'>Increased BMI</z:mp> and abdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> are associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> in overweight and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
