<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24586">hexosamines</z:chebi> on insulin synthesis and secretion, transgenic mice were created to overexpress the rate-limiting enzyme for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24586">hexosamine</z:chebi> synthesis, glutamine:<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15946">fructose-6-phosphate</z:chebi> amidotransferase (GFA), specifically in beta-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>GFA activity in islets of heterozygous transgenic mice was elevated 76% compared with littermate controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The increased GFA activity led to 1.4- and 2.1-fold increased pancreatic insulin content in 2- and 10-month-old transgenic mice, respectively (P &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fasting insulin levels were 1.6-fold higher than in littermate controls (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>Hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> was evident despite a 28% reduction in insulin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels in the transgenic mice equaled that of controls aged 2-4 months but exceeded that of the controls aged 6-10 months (means +/- SE 6.9 +/- 0.2 vs. 5.9 +/- 0.2 mmol/l, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By 8 months, the males were overweight and mildly diabetic (fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> 8.8 +/- 0.5 mmol/l) despite persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo> was confirmed in both males and females using the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp technique; <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal rates decreased by 48% in transgenic mice (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">Triglyceride</z:chebi> levels did not differ, and free fatty acid levels were lower in the transgenic animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>ATP levels were unchanged in the transgenic islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24586">hexosamine</z:chebi> biosynthesis is involved in the regulation of insulin content in beta-cells by <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24586">hexosamine</z:chebi> flux in the beta-cell results in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, and (in males) mild type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
