<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 75 type 2 diabetic patients were stratified according to their body mass index (BMI) into 40 non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (BMI 23-28 kg/m(2)) and 35 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (BMI 30-35 kg/m(2)) subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The trial was a double-blinded crossover study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In two periods of 4 weeks each the patients received subcutaneous injections of biphasic insulin aspart 50 (BIAsp 50) or biphasic insulin aspart 70 (BIAsp 70) thrice daily in random order </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Insulin doses were titrated individually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the end of each period 24-h serum profiles of insulin aspart, C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was the area under the curve of serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration during 24 h (AUC(Glu)(0-24 h)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The insulin concentration profiles of BIAsp 50 and 70 were as expected according to the content of protamine-bound insulin aspart (50 and 30% respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>AUC(Glu(0-24 h)) BIAsp 50/BIAsp 70 ratios were 0.97 (95% CI: 0.90-1.05, p = 0.49) for non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and 0.98 (95% CI: 0.92-1.05, p = 0.55) for <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fasting serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FSG) BIAsp 50/BIAsp 70 ratios were 0.90 (95% CI: 0.84-0.96, p = 0.002) for non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and 0.90 (95% CI: 0.84-0.97, p = 0.006) for <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During both treatment regimens the frequency of minor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0745153" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemic episodes</z:e> was highest for the non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the two preparations of biphasic insulin aspart were different; however, they were not influenced by the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
