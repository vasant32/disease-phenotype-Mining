<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Although variants in the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene are consistently associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, large population-based studies of African Americans are lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Moreover, few studies have investigated the effects of TCF7L2 on type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the context of metabolic risk factors of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We investigated the association between the TCF7L2 rs7903146 polymorphism and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in 2,727 African American and 9,302 Caucasian participants without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were inducted into the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Risk in Communities study in 1987-1989 and followed for 9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 485 and 923 cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were identified in African Americans and Caucasians, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with homozygous CC individuals, heterozygous CT and homozygous TT individuals had higher cumulative incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> over 9 years of follow-up: 11.3% (95% CI 10.2-12.4) vs. 21.1% (20.8-21.4) and 27.9% (19.3-36.5) in African Americans, respectively, and 9.7% (8.8-10.6) vs. 11.3% (10.2-12.4) and 13.6% (11.1-16.1), respectively, in Caucasians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Individuals with the risk allele had the highest hazards of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> if they were <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003233'>low HDL cholesterol</z:hpo>, followed by individuals with any one and none of the traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides the first significant evidence of association between the TCF7L2 rs7903146 polymorphism and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk in a large African American population and also demonstrates that the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk conveyed by the rs7903146 risk allele is substantially increased in the context of some metabolic risk factors for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our study findings need to be replicated in other large, population-based studies </plain></SENT>
