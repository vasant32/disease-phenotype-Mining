<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To confirm the efficacy of vildagliptin in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2D) by testing the hypothesis that glycosylated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA1c) reduction with vildagliptin is superior to that with voglibose after 12 weeks of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this 12-week, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group study, the efficacy and safety of vildagliptin (50 mg bid, n = 188) was compared with that of voglibose (0.2 mg tid, n = 192) in patients with T2D who were inadequately controlled with diet and exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The characteristics of two groups were well matched at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean age, body mass index (BMI) and HbA1c were 59.1 years, 24.9 kg/m(2) and 7.6%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At baseline, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) and 2-h postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi>) were 9.01 mmol/l (162.2 mg/dl) and 13.57 mmol/l (244.3 mg/dl), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The adjusted mean change in HbA1c from baseline to endpoint was -0.95 +/- 0.04% in the vildagliptin-treated patients and -0.38 +/- 0.04% in those receiving voglibose (between-group change = 0.57 +/- 0.06%, 95% confidence interval (CI) (-0.68 to -0.46%), p &lt; 0.001), showing that vildagliptin was superior to voglibose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Endpoint HbA1c &lt; or = 6.5% was achieved in 51% vildagliptin-treated patients compared with 24% patients who were on voglibose (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Vildagliptin also exhibited significantly (p &lt; 0.001) greater reduction compared with voglibose in both FPG [1.34 vs. 0.43 mmol/l (24.1 vs. 7.8 mg/dl)] and 2-h <z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi> [2.86 vs. 1.1 mmol/l (51.5 vs. 19.8 mg/dl)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall adverse events (AEs) were lower in the vildagliptin-treated patients compared with that in the voglibose-treated patients (61.2 vs. 71.4%), with no incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> and serious adverse events with vildagliptin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Gastrointestinal AEs were significantly lower with vildagliptin compared with that of the voglibose (18.6 vs. 32.8%; p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Vildagliptin (50 mg bid) showed superior efficacy and better tolerability compared with voglibose in Japanese patients with T2D </plain></SENT>
