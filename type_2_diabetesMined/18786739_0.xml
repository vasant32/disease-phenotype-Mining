<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There was a positive and statistically significant trend in WC levels with an increasing number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk factors in male patients, whereas no significant trend of WC was observed in female patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve for WC to predict the presence of two or more risk factors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> depicted greater area under the curve in male patients (0.732) than that in female patients (0.571) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Apart from positive correlation with fasting serum C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (S-CPR) and log-transformed high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (log HS-CRP) in both genders, WC was positively correlated with log-transformed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> (log TG), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi>) and negatively with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>) in male patients, whereas it was negatively correlated with HbA1c and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) in female patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The change of WC after administration (DeltaWC) was correlated with DeltaS-CPR, DeltaLDL-C, DeltaSBP and DeltaDBP in male patients, while no relationship was observed in female patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, WC is a reliable marker to predict future <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> events at least in Japanese male, but not female patients with T2DM </plain></SENT>
