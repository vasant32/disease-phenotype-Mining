<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: In this study, we tested the hypothesis that fasting serum insulin is higher in nonobese black adults than in white adults and that high fasting insulin predicts type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> equally well in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: At the baseline examination (1987-1989) of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Risk in Communities Study, fasting insulin and BMI were measured in 13,416 black and white men and women without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants were examined at years 3, 6, and 9 for incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> based on fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fasting insulin was 19.7 pmol/l higher among nonobese (BMI &lt;30 kg/m(2)) black women compared with white women (race and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> interaction term, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no differences among men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among nonobese women, the relative risk for developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was similar between racial groups: 1.4 (95% CI 1.2-1.5) and 1.3 (1.2-1.4) per 60 pmol/l increase in insulin (P &lt; 0.01) for black and white women, respectively (interaction term, P = 0.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Findings were similar among men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adjusting for established risk factors did not attenuate this association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Nonobese black women have higher fasting insulin levels than nonobese white women, and fasting insulin is an equally strong predictor of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest one mechanism to explain the excess incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in nonobese black women but do not explain the excess among black men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Future research should evaluate additional factors: genetic, environmental, or the combination of both, which might explain higher fasting insulin among black women when compared with white women </plain></SENT>
