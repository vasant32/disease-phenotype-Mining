<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway is known to result in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we investigated whether miltefosine has any deleterious effect(s) on insulin sensitivity in L6E9 skeletal muscle cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: L6E9 myotubes were treated with miltefosine and its effect was observed on insulin-signalling proteins such as Akt, PI3K, insulin receptor-beta, IRS-1, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, p38 and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase kinase beta, as well as on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Miltefosine caused skeletal muscle <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in vitro by interfering with the insulin-signalling pathway and inhibiting insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Miltefosine may contribute to the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and needs further clinical exploration </plain></SENT>
