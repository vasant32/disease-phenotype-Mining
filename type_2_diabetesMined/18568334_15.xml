<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM/HYPOTHESIS: Recently, variants in WFS1 have been shown to be associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to examine metabolic risk phenotypes of WFS1 variants in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-tolerant people and in individuals with abnormal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-associated WFS1 variant rs734312 (His611Arg) was studied in the population-based Inter99 cohort involving 4,568 glucose-tolerant individuals and 1,471 individuals with treatment-naive abnormal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> regulation, and in an additional 3,733 treated type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The WFS1 rs734312 showed a borderline significant association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with directions and relative risks consistent with previous reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In individuals with abnormal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> regulation, the diabetogenic risk A allele of rs734312 was associated in an allele-dependent manner with a decrease in insulinogenic index (p = 0.025) and decreased 30-min serum insulin levels (p = 0.047) after an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> load </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-tolerant individuals the same allele was associated with increased fasting serum insulin concentration (p = 0.019) and homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-IR; p = 0.026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To study the complex interaction of WFS1 rs734312 on insulin release and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> we introduced Hotelling's T (2) test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Assuming bivariate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> distribution, we constructed standard error ellipses of the insulinogenic index and HOMA-IR when stratified according to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance status around the means of each WFS1 rs734312 genotype level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The interaction term between individuals with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance and abnormal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> regulation on the insulinogenic index and HOMA-IR was significantly associated with the traits (p = 0.0017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-associated risk alleles of WFS1 are associated with estimates of a decreased pancreatic beta cell function among middle-aged individuals with abnormal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> regulation </plain></SENT>
