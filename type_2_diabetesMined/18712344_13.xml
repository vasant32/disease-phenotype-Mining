<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The gene encoding transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) has been related to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in multiple ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigate whether three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TCF7L2 gene are associated with an impaired proinsulin:insulin ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this study we examined the associations between SNPs rs7901695, rs7903146 and rs12255372 in the TCF7L2 gene and metabolic variables affecting type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a population-based study of 706 unrelated individuals (47% men and 53% women; aged 35-74 years) from the province of Segovia in central Spain (Castille), including 180 individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The minor allele frequency of rs7901695, rs7903146 and rs12255372 was significantly higher in diabetic patients compared with that in non-diabetic individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The T (minor) allele of the variant rs7903146 was significantly associated with a greater OR for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> adjusted for age, sex and BMI in logistic regression analysis: OR 1.29 (95% CI 1.06-1.57, p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This risk allele was also associated with an increased proinsulin:insulin ratio after OGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similar results were obtained for the other TCF7L2 SNPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our results provide further evidence supporting the belief that the TCF7L2 gene is a major determinant of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk in Spain, as in other southern European populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The association with increased proinsulin:insulin ratio after an OGTT suggests that TCF7L2 might be involved in insulin synthesis and processing </plain></SENT>
