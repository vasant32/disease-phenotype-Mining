<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Prior reports have suggested that variants in the genes for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004904'>maturity-onset diabetes of the young</z:hpo> (MODY) may confer susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but results have been conflicting and coverage of the MODY genes has been incomplete </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To complement our previous studies of HNF4A, we examined the other five known MODY genes for association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Finnish individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For each of the five genes, we selected 1) nonredundant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (r(2)&lt; 0.8 with other SNPs) from the HapMap database or another linkage disequilibrium map, 2) SNPs with previously reported type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> association, and 3) nonsynonymous coding SNPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We tested 128 SNPs for association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in 786 index cases from type 2 diabetic families and 619 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-tolerant control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We followed up 35 of the most significant SNPs by genotyping them on another 384 case subjects and 366 control subjects from Finland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also supplemented our previous HNF4A results by genotyping 12 SNPs on additional Finnish samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After correcting for testing multiple correlated SNPs within a gene, we find evidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> association with SNPs in five of the six known MODY genes: GCK, HNF1A, HNF1B, NEUROD1, and HNF4A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that common variants in several MODY genes play a modest role in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility </plain></SENT>
