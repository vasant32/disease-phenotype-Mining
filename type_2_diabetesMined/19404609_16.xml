<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The variants identified are common and have low penetrance in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study is to investigate the combined effect of the 19 variants by applying receiver operating characteristics (ROC) to demonstrate the discriminatory value between <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-tolerant individuals and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients in a cross-sectional population of Danes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The 19 variants were genotyped in three study populations: the population-based Inter99 study; the ADDITION study; and additional type 2 diabetic patients and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-tolerant individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The case-control studies involved 4,093 type 2 diabetic patients and 5,302 glucose-tolerant individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Single-variant analyses demonstrated allelic odds ratios ranging from 1.04 (95% CI 0.98-1.11) to 1.33 (95% CI 1.22-1.45) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When combining the 19 variants, subgroups with extreme risk profiles showed a threefold difference in the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (lower 10% carriers with &lt; or =15 risk alleles vs upper 10% carriers with &gt; or =22 risk alleles, OR 2.93 (95% CI 2.38-3.62, p = 1.6 x 10(-25)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We calculated the area under a ROC curve to estimate the discrimination rate between <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-tolerant individuals and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients based on the 19 variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found an area under the ROC curve of 0.60 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two-way gene-gene interaction showed few nominal interaction effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Combined analysis of the 19 validated variants enables detection of subgroups at substantially increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; however, the discrimination between <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-tolerant and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> individuals is still too inaccurate to achieve clinical value </plain></SENT>
