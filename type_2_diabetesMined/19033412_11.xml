<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess associations between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000763'>peripheral sensory neuropathy</z:hpo> (PSN) and other <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHOD: In an area-based cohort of type 2 diabetic subjects, we investigated 156 subjects (age 61.7 +/- 7.2 years and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration 7.0 +/- 5.7 years) by questionnaires, clinical examinations, blood and urine sampling, and review of medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Prevalence of PSN, assessed by monofilament and neurothesiometer testing, increased with severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (50% frequency in moderate and 100% in severe or proliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>; P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Vibration perception threshold was higher in subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (25.6 +/- 8.9 vs. 20.5 +/- 8.9 V; P = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PSN was more common in subjects with overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, with higher vibration perception thresholds, than in subjects without overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subjects with PSN but no <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> had twice the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo> (PVD) (52%) as subjects with both PSN and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (19%; P = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In subjects with PSN alone, PVD was three times more likely (52%) than in subjects without PSN (16%; P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, PSN was independently associated with PVD (odds ratio 2.31; P = 0.007), age (1.12; P = 0.008), male sex (2.01; P = 0.02), and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (0.21; P &lt; 0.05) and tended to be independently associated with IGF-1 binding protein (1.03; P = 0.05) but not with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration or A1C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In a representative population of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, PSN is related to microvascular and macrovascular pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PSN is possibly affected by the IGF axis </plain></SENT>
