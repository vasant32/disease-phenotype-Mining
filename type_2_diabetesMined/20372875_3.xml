<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We also explored variation in anthropometric associations by sex and ethnicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed cross-sectional analysis of 22,293 men and women who were from five ethnic groups and 21 countries, and at risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Standardised anthropometric associations with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and AUC of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> status from OGTT (AUC(OGTT)) were determined using multiple regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Explanatory power was assessed using the c-statistic and adjusted r (2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An increase in BMI, waist circumference or WHR had similar positive associations with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, AUC(OGTT) and explanatory power after adjustment for age, sex, smoking and ethnicity (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, using BMI and WHR together resulted in greater explanatory power than with other models (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Associations were strongest when waist circumference and hip circumference were used together, a combination that had greater explanatory power than other models except for BMI and WHR together (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results were directionally similar according to sex and ethnicity; however, significant variations in associations were observed among these subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The combination of BMI and WHR, or of waist circumference and hip circumference has the best explanatory power for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> status compared with a single anthropometric measure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Measurement of waist circumference and hip circumference is required to optimally identify people at risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and people with elevated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
