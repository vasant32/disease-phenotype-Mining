<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Fat intake, especially <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25413">monounsaturated fatty acid</z:chebi> (MUFA), has been liberalized in diabetic diets to preserve <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> and improve glycemic control, yet the exact sources have not been clearly defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we assessed the effect of mixed nut consumption as a source of vegetable fat on serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and HbA(1c) in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 117 type 2 diabetic subjects were randomized to one of three treatments for 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Supplements were provided at 475 kcal per 2,000-kcal diet as mixed nuts (75 g/day), muffins, or half portions of both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was change in HbA(1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The relative increase in MUFAs was 8.7% energy on the full-nut dose compared with muffins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using an intention-to-treat analysis (n = 117), full-nut dose (mean intake 73 g/day) reduced HbA(1c) (-0.21% absolute HbA(1c) units, 95% CI -0.30 to -0.11, P &lt; 0.001) with no change after half-nut dose or muffin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Full-nut dose was significantly different from half-nut dose (P = 0.004) and muffin (P = 0.001), but no difference was seen between half-nut dose and muffins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> also decreased significantly after full-nut dose compared with muffin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> reduction after half-nut dose was intermediate and not significantly different from the other treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">Apolipoprotein</z:chebi> (apo) B and the apoB:apoA1 ratio behaved similarly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nut intake related negatively to changes in HbA(1c) (r = -0.20, P = 0.033) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (r = -0.24, P = 0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Two ounces of nuts daily as a replacement for carbohydrate foods improved both glycemic control and serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
