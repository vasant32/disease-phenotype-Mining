<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there are no prospective studies directly investigating the role of TL and relevant genes in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the multiethnic Women's Health Initiative, we identified 1,675 incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> case participants in 6 years of follow-up and 2,382 control participants matched by age, ethnicity, clinical center, time of blood draw, and follow-up duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Leukocyte TL at baseline was measured using quantitative PCR, and Mendelian randomization analysis was conducted to test whether TL is causally associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for matching and known <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk factors, odds ratios per 1-kilobase increment were 1.00 (95% CI 0.90-1.11) in whites, 0.95 (0.85-1.06) in blacks, 0.96 (0.79-1.17) in Hispanics, and 0.88 (0.70-1.10) in Asians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 80 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in nine genes involved in telomere regulation, 14 SNPs were predictive of TL, but none were significantly associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using ethnicity-specific SNPs as randomization instruments, we observed no statistically significant association between TL and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk (P = 0.52) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although leukocyte TL was weakly associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk, this association was not independent of known risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These prospective findings indicate limited clinical utility of TL in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk stratification among postmenopausal women </plain></SENT>
