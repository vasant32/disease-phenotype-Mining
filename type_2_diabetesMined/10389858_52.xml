<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Uncoupling protein 2 (UCP-2) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression has been shown to be altered by metabolic conditions such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in humans, but its functional significance is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The expression of UCP-2 mRNA and protein in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rat islets was established by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunocytochemistry in pancreatic islets and tissue, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intense immunostaining of UCP-2 correlated with insulin-positive ,-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of UCP-2 in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rat islets was accomplished by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with an adenovirus (AdEGI-UCP-2) containing the full-length human UCP-2 coding sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Induction of the AdEGI-UCP-2 gene resulted in severe blunting of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) without affecting islet insulin content or the ability of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22986">calcium ionophore</z:chebi> A23187 to increase insulin secretion from AdEGI-UCP-2-expressing islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, UCP-2 overexpression affects signal transduction proximal to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>-mediated steps, including exocytosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Insulin secretion from single beta-cells to 16.5 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> examined by reverse hemolytic plaque assay was nearly ablated if UCP-2 was overexpressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, a direct, causal relationship between overexpression of UCP-2 and inhibition of GSIS in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> islets has been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that increased expression of UCP-2 has the potential to cause the lack of a <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> effect on insulin secretion in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
