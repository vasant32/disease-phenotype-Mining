<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These defects reflect both genetic components and environmental risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, the common Gly(972)--&gt;Arg amino acid polymorphism of insulin receptor substrate 1 (Arg(972) IRS-1) has been associated with human type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we report on some functional and morphological properties of isolated human islets carrying the Arg(972) IRS-1 polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Insulin content was lower in variant than control islets (94 +/- 47 vs. 133 +/- 56 microU/islet; P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stepwise <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> increase (1.7 to 16.7 mmol/l) significantly potentiated insulin secretion from control islets, but not Arg(972) IRS-1 islets, with the latter also showing a relatively lower response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi> and a significantly higher response to arginine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Proinsulin release mirrored insulin secretion, and the insulin-to-proinsulin ratio in response to arginine was significantly lower from Arg(972) IRS-1 islets than from control islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> utilization and oxidation did not differ in variant and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> islets at both low and high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopy showed that Arg(972) IRS-1 beta-cells had a severalfold greater number of immature secretory granules and a lower number of mature granules than control beta-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, Arg(972) IRS-1 islets have reduced insulin content, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948379" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">impaired insulin secretion</z:e>, and a lower amount of mature secretory granules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These alterations may account for the increased predisposition to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in individuals carrying the Gly(972)--&gt;Arg amino acid polymorphism of IRS-1 </plain></SENT>
