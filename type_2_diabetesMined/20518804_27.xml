<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were pooled from 25 Phase III studies of vildagliptin, used either as monotherapy or combination therapy, with durations of 12 weeks to &gt; or = 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The safety of vildagliptin [50 mg qd (N = 1393) or 50 mg bid (N = 6116)] was assessed relative to a pool of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> comparators [both placebo and active comparators (N = 6061)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CCV events were adjudicated in a prospective, blinded fashion by an independent CCV adjudication committee </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Meta-analysis of confirmed CCV events was performed with Mantel-Haenszel risk ratios (RRs); categories included in the composite endpoint were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndrome, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attack</z:e> (with imaging evidence of infarction), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and CCV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analyses by age (&lt; and &gt; or = 65 years), gender and cardiovascular (CV) risk status [high CV risk status defined as a previous history of events in the Standard MedDRA Queries of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischaemic heart disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo>, ischaemic cerebrovascular conditions and/or embolic/thrombotic events, arterial) were also carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, unadjusted and exposure-adjusted incidences are presented for both the composite endpoint and its components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Relative to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> comparators, the RRs for the composite endpoint were &lt; 1 for both vildagliptin 50 mg qd [RR = 0.88; 95% CI (0.37, 2.11)] and vildagliptin 50 mg bid [RR = 0.84; 95% CI (0.62, 1.14)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results were consistent across subgroups defined by age, gender and CV risk status, including the higher CV risk subgroups of elderly patients [RR for vildagliptin 50 mg bid vs. <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> comparators = 1.04; 95% CI (0.62, 1.73)], males [RR = 0.87; 95% CI (0.60, 1.24)] or patients with a high CV risk status [RR = 0.78; 95% CI (0.51, 1.19)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The exposure-adjusted incidences of each component of the composite endpoint for vildagliptin 50 mg bid were also lower than or similar to those of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> comparators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In a large meta-analysis, vildagliptin was not associated with an increased risk of adjudicated CCV events relative to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> comparators in the broad population of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> including patients at increased risk of CCV events </plain></SENT>
