<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A prospective cohort study was performed in the setting of Spanish primary care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>White-European individuals without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> aged 45-75 years (n = 2,054) were screened using the Finnish <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Risk Score (FINDRISC) and a subsequent 2 h OGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Where feasible, high-risk individuals who were identified were allocated sequentially to standard care, a group-based or an individual level intervention (intensive reinforced DE-PLAN [<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> in Europe-Prevention using Lifestyle, Physical Activity and Nutritional] intervention) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> according to WHO criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analyses after 4-year follow-up were performed based on the intention-to-treat principle with comparison of standard care and the combined intervention groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The standard care (n = 219) and intensive intervention (n = 333) groups were comparable in age (62.0/62.2 years), sex (64.4/68.2% women), BMI (31.3/31.2 kg/m(2)), FINDRISC score (16.2/15.8 points), fasting (5.3/5.2 mmol/l), 2 h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (7.1/6.9 mmol/l) and self-reported interest to make lifestyle changes at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> was diagnosed in 124 individuals: 63 (28.8%) in the standard care group and 61 (18.3%) in the intensive intervention group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During a 4.2-year median follow-up, the incidences of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were 7.2 and 4.6 cases per 100 person-years, respectively (36.5% relative risk reduction, p &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The number of participants needed to be treated by intensive intervention for 4 years to reduce one case of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 9.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Intensive lifestyle intervention is feasible in a primary care setting and substantially reduces <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence among high-risk individuals </plain></SENT>
