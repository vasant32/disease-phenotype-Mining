<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among the 28 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> monkeys (percent body fat greater than 22%) over the age of 10 years, 9 developed overt Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, greater than 7.8 mmol/l, and reduced <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disappearance rates, KG less than 1.5), and 14 monkeys have shown progressive changes which suggest that they may also become diabetic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Application of a highly constant antecedent diet and a consistent 16-h fast minimized experimental variability, and permitted the identification of 8 phases in the progression from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lean young adult to overt Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The earliest changes which could be detected were a slight increase followed by a progressive rise in fasting plasma insulin levels and an <z:mp ids='MP_0003058'>increased insulin secretion</z:mp> in response to a <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> stimulus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These events preceded by several years the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of a gradual deterioration of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that hyper-, normo-, or hypoinsulinaemia could be associated with normoglycaemia or varying degrees of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e>; however, the prospective longitudinal study of individual monkeys clearly identified this apparent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of plasma insulin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels as reflecting sequential changes in a continuum of events preceding or accompanying the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> and Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
