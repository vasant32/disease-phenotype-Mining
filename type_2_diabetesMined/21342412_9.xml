<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this phase 3, parallel-group, double-blind, active-controlled study, 1306 patients 18-77 years of age (HbA1c 8.0-12.0%) were randomized to saxagliptin 5 mg + 500 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, saxagliptin 10 mg + 500 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, saxagliptin 10 mg + placebo or 500 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> + placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blinded <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> was titrated during weeks 1-5 of the short-term treatment period in 500 mg/day increments to 2000 mg/day maximum in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>-based treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No titration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> was permitted during the long-term treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 888 patients completed the study (76 weeks), 613 without being rescued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Changes in HbA1c, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, 120-min postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi>-area under the curve (AUC) from baseline to week 76 were analysed using a repeated-measures model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At 76 weeks, adjusted mean changes from baseline HbA1c (95% CI) for saxagliptin 5 mg + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, saxagliptin 10 mg + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, saxagliptin 10 mg and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> were -2.31 (-2.44, -2.18), -2.33 (-2.46, -2.20), -1.55 (-1.70, -1.40) and -1.79% (-1.93, -1.65), respectively (post hoc and nominal p &lt; 0.0001 vs. <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and saxagliptin monotherapies for saxagliptin 5 mg + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and saxagliptin 10 mg + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The proportions of patients requiring rescue or discontinuation for insufficient glycaemic control were lower for saxagliptin + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> than for either monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Little or no attenuation in <z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi>-AUC or 120-min <z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi> was observed between weeks 24 and 76 for saxagliptin + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, indicating persistent efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Adverse event rates were similar across groups; hypoglycaemic events occurred at a low frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Saxagliptin + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> initial combination therapy was well tolerated and produced sustained glycaemic control for up to 76 weeks, with greater improvements in glycaemic parameters compared with either drug alone </plain></SENT>
