<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Carnosinase 1 (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36826">CN1</z:chebi>) is a secreted dipeptidase that hydrolyzes L-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15727">carnosine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, we have identified an allelic variant of human <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36826">CN1</z:chebi> (hCN1) that results in increased enzyme activity and is associated with susceptibility for diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in human diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore hypothesized that L-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15727">carnosine</z:chebi> in the serum represents a critical protective factor in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: L-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15727">carnosine</z:chebi> serum levels were manipulated in db/db mice, a model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a transgenic approach, hCN1 cDNA was expressed under the control of a liver-specific promoter in db/db mice, mimicking the expression pattern of hCN1 in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> as well as A1C levels rose significantly earlier and remained higher in transgenic animals throughout life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Body weights were reduced as a result of significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0003076'>glucosuria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In an opposite approach, nontransgenic db/db mice were supplemented with L-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15727">carnosine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In these latter mice, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> manifested significantly later and milder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In agreement with the above data, serum fasting insulin levels were low in the transgenic mice and elevated by L-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15727">carnosine</z:chebi> feeding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo> and insulin secretion were not significantly affected by L-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15727">carnosine</z:chebi> serum levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Instead, a significant correlation of L-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15727">carnosine</z:chebi> levels with beta-cell mass was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: hCN1-dependent susceptibility to diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> may at least in part be mediated by altered <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
