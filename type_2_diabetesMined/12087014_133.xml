<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We searched for English language trials in Medline (1980-1999), Cinahl (1982-1999), and the Educational Resources Information Center database (ERIC) (1980-1999), and we manually searched review articles, journals with highest topic relevance, and reference lists of included articles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Studies were included if they were randomized controlled trials that were published in the English language, tested the effect of self-management education on adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and reported extractable data on the effect of treatment on GHb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 31 studies of 463 initially identified articles met selection criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We computed net change in GHb, stratified by follow-up interval, tested for trial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>, and calculated pooled effects sizes using random effects models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We examined the effect of baseline GHb, follow-up interval, and intervention characteristics on GHb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On average, the intervention decreased GHb by 0.76% (95% CI 0.34-1.18) more than the control group at immediate follow-up; by 0.26% (0.21% increase - 0.73% decrease) at 1-3 months of follow-up; and by 0.26% (0.05-0.48) at &gt; or = 4 months of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>GHb decreased more with additional contact time between participant and educator; a decrease of 1% was noted for every additional 23.6 h (13.3-105.4) of contact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Self-management education improves GHb levels at immediate follow-up, and increased contact time increases the effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The benefit declines 1-3 months after the intervention ceases, however, suggesting that learned behaviors change over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further research is needed to develop interventions effective in maintaining long-term glycemic control </plain></SENT>
