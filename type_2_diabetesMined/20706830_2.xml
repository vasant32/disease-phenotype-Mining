<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: At baseline in 1975 same-sex twin pairs born in Finland before 1958 were sent a questionnaire including questions on physical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The participants (20,487 individuals, including 8,182 complete twin pairs) were divided into quintiles by leisure-time physical activity metabolic equivalent (MET) index (MET h/day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was determined from nationwide registers for the follow-up period (1 January 1976-31 December 2004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Individual and pairwise Cox proportional hazard models were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During follow-up, 1,082 type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> cases were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> individuals, participants in MET quintiles (Q) III-V had significantly decreased risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with sedentary individuals (QI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pairwise analysis on pairs discordant for physical activity showed that participants in MET QII to V had significantly lower hazard ratios (0.61, 0.59, 0.61, 0.61) compared with sedentary participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings from the pairwise analysis persisted after adjusting for BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the pairwise analysis, the BMI-adjusted hazard ratio for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was lower for physically active members of twin pairs (combined QII-V) than for inactive co-twins (HR 0.54; 95% CI 0.37-0.78) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Similar results were obtained for both dizygotic and monozygotic pairs, as well as for the subgroup of twin pairs defined as free of co-morbidities in 1981 (HR 0.36; 95% CI 0.17-0.76) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Leisure-time physical activity protects from type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after taking familial and genetic effects into account </plain></SENT>
