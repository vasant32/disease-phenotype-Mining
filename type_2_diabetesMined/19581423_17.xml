<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Significant new data suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disorders</z:e> such as <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> posses an important inflammatory component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Infiltrating macrophages contribute to both tissue-specific and systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, which promotes <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The complement cascade is involved in the inflammatory cascade initiated by the innate and adaptive immune response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A mouse genomic F2 cross biology was performed and identified several causal genes linked to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, including the complement pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We therefore sought to investigate the effect of a C3a receptor (C3aR) deletion on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and macrophage function utilizing both the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-diet (ND) and a diet-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> mouse model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We demonstrate that high C3aR expression is found in white adipose tissue and increases upon high-fat diet (HFD) feeding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both adipocytes and macrophages within the white adipose tissue express significant amounts of C3aR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>C3aR(-/-) mice on HFD are transiently resistant to diet-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> during an 8-week period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Metabolic profiling suggests that they are also protected from HFD-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>liver steatosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>C3aR(-/-) mice had improved insulin sensitivity on both ND and HFD as seen by an insulin tolerance test and an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Adipose tissue analysis revealed a striking decrease in macrophage infiltration with a concomitant reduction in both tissue and plasma proinflammatory cytokine production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, C3aR(-/-) macrophages polarized to the M1 phenotype showed a considerable decrease in proinflammatory mediators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our results suggest that the C3aR in macrophages, and potentially adipocytes, plays an important role in adipose tissue homeostasis and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
