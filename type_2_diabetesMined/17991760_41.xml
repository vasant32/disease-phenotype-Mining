<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Vaspin was identified as an adipokine with insulin-sensitizing effects, which is predominantly secreted from visceral adipose tissue in a rat model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have recently shown that vaspin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in adipose tissue is related to parameters of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the regulation of vaspin serum concentrations in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: For the measurement of vaspin serum concentrations, we developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using this ELISA, we assessed circulating vaspin in a cross-sectional study of 187 subjects with a wide range of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, body fat distribution, insulin sensitivity, and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance and in 60 individuals with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (NGT), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT), or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> before and after a 4-week physical training program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Vaspin serum concentrations were significantly higher in female compared with male subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in circulating vaspin between individuals with NGT and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-tolerant group, circulating vaspin significantly correlated with BMI and insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, physical training for 4 weeks resulted in significantly increased circulating vaspin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found a sexual dimorphism in circulating vaspin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Elevated vaspin serum concentrations are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and impaired insulin sensitivity, whereas type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> seems to abrogate the correlation between increased circulating vaspin, higher body weight, and decreased insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Low circulating vaspin correlates with a high fitness level, whereas physical training in untrained individuals causes increased vaspin serum concentrations </plain></SENT>
