<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In the context of the Multinational MGSD Nutrition Study, three groups of subjects were studied: 204 subjects with recently diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (RDM), 42 subjects with undiagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (UDM) (American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association criteria-fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> [FPG] &gt; or =126 mg/dl), and 55 subjects with impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (IFG) (FPG &gt; or =110 and &lt;126 mg/dl) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each group was compared with a control group of nondiabetic subjects, matched one by one for center, sex, age, and BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nutritional habits were evaluated by a dietary history method, validated against the 3-day diet diary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In RDM, the questionnaire referred to the nutritional habits before the diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Demographic data were collected, and anthropometrical and biochemical measurements were taken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with control subjects, RDM more frequently had a family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (49.0 vs. 14.2%; P &lt; 0.001), exercised less (exercise index 53.5 vs. 64.4; P &lt; 0.01), and more frequently had sedentary professions (47.5 vs. 27.4%; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Carbohydrates contributed less to their energy intake (53.5 vs. 55.1%; P &lt; 0.05), whereas total fat (30.2 +/- 0.5 vs. 27.8 +/- 0.5%; P &lt; 0.001) and animal fat (12.2 +/- 0.3 vs. 10.8 +/- 0.3%; P &lt; 0.01) contributed more and the plant-to-animal fat ratio was lower (1.5 +/- 0.1 vs. 1.8 +/- 0.1; P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>UDM more frequently had a family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (38.1 vs. 19.0%; P &lt; 0.05) and sedentary professions (58.5 vs. 34.1%; P &lt; 0.05), carbohydrates contributed less to their energy intake (47.6 +/- 1.7 vs. 52.8 +/- 1.4%; P &lt; 0.05), total fat (34.7 +/- 1.5 vs. 30.4 +/- 1.2%; P &lt; 0.05) and animal fat (14.2 +/- 0.9 vs. 10.6 +/- 0.7%; P &lt; 0.05) contributed more, and the plant-to-animal fat ratio was lower (1.6 +/- 0.2 vs. 2.3 +/- 0.4; P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>IFG differed only in the prevalence of family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (32.7 vs. 16.4%; P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the view that increased animal fat intake is associated with the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
