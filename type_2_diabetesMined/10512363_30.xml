<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have shown that genetic deficiency of the adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (aP2) results in minor alterations of plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and adipocyte development but provides significant protection from dietary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To identify potential mechanisms responsible for this phenotype, we examined lipolysis and insulin secretion in aP2-/- mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Beta-adrenergic stimulation resulted in a blunted rise of blood <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> levels in aP2-/- compared with aP2+/+ mice, suggesting diminished lipolysis in aP2-/- adipocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Confirming this, primary adipocytes isolated from aP2-/- mice showed attenuated <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> and free fatty acid (FFA) release in response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50095">dibutyryl cAMP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The decreased lipolytic response seen in the aP2-/- mice was not associated with altered expression levels of hormone-sensitive lipase or perilipin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin secretory response to beta-adrenergic stimulation was also profoundly suppressed in aP2-/- mice despite comparable total concentrations and only minor changes in the composition of systemic FFAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To address whether levels of specific fatty acids are different in aP2-/- mice, the plasma FFA profile after beta-adrenergic stimulation was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant reduction in both stearic and cis-11-eicoseneic acids and an increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28716">palmitoleic acid</z:chebi> were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The response of aP2-/- mice to other insulin secretagogues such as arginine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi> was similar to that of aP2+/+ mice, arguing against generally impaired function of pancreatic beta-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, no aP2 expression was detected in isolated pancreatic islet cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results provide support for the existence of an adipo-pancreatic axis, the proper action of which relies on the presence of aP2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Consequently, aP2's role in the pathogenesis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> might involve regulation of both <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> through its impact on both lipolysis and insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
