<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study explored cultural individualist and collectivist aspects of self-management and their relationship to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 94 Adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for over 1 year and Chinese spoken as a first language at home recruited through healthcare providers completed the newly developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Management Orientation Scale (DMOS), and a validated <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Self-Efficacy Scale (DSES) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Exploratory factor analysis and logistic regression was used to examine the factor structure and relationship to glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three factors were extracted from the DMOS: Individualist, Collectivist, and Balanced Personal Responsibility (BPR) Orientations to self-management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BPR orientation was the only significant psychosocial predictor of glycemic control in this population (odds ratio of 2.85 for having good <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> control; HbA1c&lt;7.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Self-efficacy did not predict glycemic control in our sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Self-management education and clinical care that builds on BPR orientation may be more important than a sole focus on strengthening self-efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The DMOS has external validity and is potentially useful for both practice and research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Future research should explore how BPR orientation is developed, and whether it predicts glycemic control within more individualist cultures </plain></SENT>
