<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This has been partly attributed to impaired respiratory neuromuscular function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, data on respiratory neuromuscular involvement in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study therefore aimed to assess respiratory neuromuscular function related to diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001271'>polyneuropathy</z:hpo> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Respiratory neuromuscular function was assessed by the use of volitional tests and twitch mouth (TwPmo) and twitch transdiaphragmatic (TwPdi) pressures during non-volitional bilateral anterior magnetic phrenic nerve stimulation in 21 male type 2 diabetic patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary disease</z:e> and in 23 healthy, well-matched controls (forced expiratory volume in 1 s 103 +/- 11 vs 103 +/- 12% predicted; p = 0.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both volitionally assessed maximal inspiratory and expiratory mouth pressures, and sniff nasal and transdiaphragmatic pressures were comparable between diabetic patients and controls (p &gt; 0.1 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TwPmo was reduced in diabetic patients compared with controls (1.3 +/- 0.5 vs 1.0 +/- 0.4 kPa; p = 0.04), while TwPdi was comparable (1.7 +/- 0.5 vs 1.6 +/- 0.7 kPa; p = 0.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Following subgroup analysis, patients with no or mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001271'>polyneuropathy</z:hpo> (n = 10) as assessed by neurological disability scoring had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> respiratory neuromuscular function, whereas patients with moderate or severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001271'>polyneuropathy</z:hpo> (n = 11) presented with markedly impaired respiratory neuromuscular function as indicated by TwPmo (1.3 +/- 0.4 vs 0.8 +/- 0.3 kPa; p = 0.01) and TwPdi (1.9 +/- 0.6 vs 1.1 +/- 0.4 kPa; p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: With regard to volitional tests, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> does not affect respiratory neuromuscular function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the application of non-volitional phrenic nerve stimulation provides strong evidence that diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001271'>polyneuropathy</z:hpo>, as simply assessed by neurological disability scoring, is associated with substantially impaired respiratory neuromuscular function in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
