<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> can affect blood pressure (BP) through their plasma concentrations, which are dependent on their receptor activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We thus assessed the association between nine NPR3 gene polymorphisms and BP levels in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) tagging the haplotype structure of the NPR3 gene were genotyped in the 3,126 French <z:mp ids='MP_0002057'>Non-insulin-dependent Diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>Microalbuminuria</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>Proteinuria</z:hpo>, Cardiovascular Events, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8774">Ramipril</z:chebi> (DIABHYCAR) trial participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We then used a second population (Diabete de type 2, Nephropathie et Genetique [DIAB2NEPHROGENE]/Survie, Diabete de type 2 et Genetique [SURDIAGENE] study) of 2,452 patients for the purpose of replication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, we separately investigated subjects selected according to their rs 2270915SNP genotypes for their BP response to salt restriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In DIABHYCAR patients, three SNPs (rs6889608, rs1173773, and rs2270915) were significantly associated with systolic BP (SBP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The effect of the rs2270915 was replicated in the second step population: AA homozygotes had a lower SBP than G carriers (137.4 ± 19.1 vs. 140.0 ± 20.2 mmHg, P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The rs2270915 influenced the response of SBP to salt reduction, with AA homozygous patients showing greater reductions after restriction of salt intake compared with G carriers: -20 mmHg (-43 to -8) vs. -3 (-20 to +7); P = 0.006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found a consistent and significant association between the rs2270915 polymorphism of the NPR3 gene and SBP in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This genetic variation may affect pressure response to changes in dietary <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
