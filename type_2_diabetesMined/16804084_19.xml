<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies indicate that osteoprotegerin also acts as an important regulatory molecule in the vasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between plasma osteoprotegerin levels and endothelium-dependent arterial dilation in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study subjects included 40 newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients and 46 healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were given insulin therapy for 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma osteoprotegerin concentration was measured in duplicate by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method, and high-resolution ultrasound was used to measure brachial artery diameter at rest, after reactive hyperemia, and after sublingual glyceryltrinitrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The plasma osteoprotegerin level in patients before treatment was 3.36 +/- 0.32 ng/l, which was significantly higher than that in control subjects (2.38 +/- 0.25 ng/l, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 6 months of treatment, osteoprotegerin levels decreased markedly (2.83 +/- 0.34 ng/l, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Flow-mediated endothelium-dependent arterial dilation in patients before treatment was 3.21 +/- 0.52%, which was significantly lower than that in control subjects (4.46 +/- 0.56%, P &lt; 0.01), and it improved markedly after 6 months of treatment (4.03 +/- 0.49%, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, osteoprotegerin was significantly associated with endothelium-dependent arterial dilation, fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FBG), HbA(1c) (A1C), and ultrasensitive C-reactive protein (CRP) at baseline (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The absolute changes in osteoprotegerin showed significant correlation with changes in endothelium-dependent arterial dilation, FBG, A1C, and CRP in diabetic patients during the course of treatment (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study shows that plasma osteoprotegerin levels are elevated in newly diagnosed diabetic patients and are significantly associated with endothelial function </plain></SENT>
