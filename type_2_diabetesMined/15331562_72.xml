<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate whether adiponectin, a major adipocyte secretory protein, predicts <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we conducted a case-cohort study representing the approximately 9-year experience of the 10,275 middle-aged, U.S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>African-American and white participants of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Risk in Communities (ARIC) study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adiponectin was measured on stored plasma of 581 incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> case subjects and 572 noncase subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall hazard ratios (95% CIs) for developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, for those in the second, third, and fourth (versus the first) quartile of adiponectin were 0.57 (0.41-0.78), 0.39 (0.27-0.56), and 0.18 (0.11-0.27), respectively, after adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, study center, parental history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and 0.72 (0.48-1.09), 0.67 (0.43-1.04), and 0.58 (0.34-0.99), respectively, after additional adjustment for BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, and a score composed of six <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The association was of similar magnitude in men and women and in whites and African Americans, but was absent in smokers and in those with a greater <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> score (interaction P &lt; 0.01 for each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, in this community-based sample of U.S. adults, higher adiponectin levels were associated with a lower incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
