<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanism that converts islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (IAPP), the unique component of these deposits, into amyloid fibrils in vivo is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The amino acid sequence of IAPP is critical but insufficient for beta-pleated sheet formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E (apoE), another component of islet amyloid deposits, plays a critical role in amyloid formation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, we hypothesised that apoE could play an important role in islet amyloid formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Transgenic mice expressing the human form of IAPP ( hIAPP (+/0)) were crossbred with apoE deficient ( apoE (-/-)) mice and followed for 12 months, at which time the prevalence and severity of islet amyloid, as well as plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, hIAPP, immunoreactive insulin (IRI) and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> concentrations were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence and severity of islet amyloid after one year of follow up were comparable among hIAPP (+/0) mice that were apoE (+/+), apoE (+/-) or apoE (-/-) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Differences in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> abnormalities or changes in pancreatic content or plasma concentrations of hIAPP and/or IRI did not account for these findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: Our data shows that, unlike in the localized <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> in the brain characteristic of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, apoE is not critical for islet amyloid formation in a transgenic mouse model of Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the mechanisms of localised amyloid formation probably vary among different amyloid-associated disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, therapeutic strategies targeting apoE might not apply equally to patients with different amyloid associated diseases </plain></SENT>
