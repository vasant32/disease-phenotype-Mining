<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Long-term implications of childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and BMI change over the life course for risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> remain uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective was to establish whether there are effects on adult <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism of 1) sensitive periods of BMI gain or 2) long duration of overweight and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Participants in the 1958 British birth cohort with child to adult BMI and glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA(1c)) at 45 years (n = 7,855) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or HbA(1c) ≥7 was 2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BMI gains in child- and adulthood were associated with higher HbA(1c): for every SD of 5-year BMI increase from 0 to 7 years, there was a 75% (95% CI 1.42-2.16) increased risk of HbA(1c) ≥7, increasing to a 4.7-fold (3.12-7.00) risk for the interval 23-33 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Associations for BMI gain in adulthood were related to attained BMI but were independent for the longer period birth (or 7 years) to 45 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> was also associated with HbA(1c); compared with the never <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011463'>childhood onset</z:hpo> had a 23.9-fold risk (13.5-42.1) of HbA(1c) ≥7%; odds ratios were 16.0 (10.6-24.2) and 2.99 (1.77-5.03), respectively, for young and midadulthood <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similar trends by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> age were found in mean HbA(1c) levels and for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of overweight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Those with the earliest <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> had higher BMI and waist circumference at 45 years, which markedly explained the associations for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> age and HbA(1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Excessive BMI gain across the life span and earlier <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of overweight/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> are associated with impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism, in part through attained adult BMI </plain></SENT>
