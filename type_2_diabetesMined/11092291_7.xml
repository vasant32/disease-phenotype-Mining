<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A 10-year prospective study consisting of a representative group of 133 (70 men, 63 women) newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients diagnosed at health centers between 1979 and 1981 and 144 (62 men, 82 women) nondiabetic control subjects recruited from the population register was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMD</z:e> was determined by grading of 45 degrees stereoscopic fundus photographs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The subjects were studied at baseline and after 5 and 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: By the 10-year follow-up, visual acuity had declined more markedly in the diabetic patients than in the control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMD</z:e> was nearly the same in both groups (11-19%), it <z:hpo ids='HP_0000505'>decreased visual acuity</z:hpo> earlier in the diabetic patients than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMD</z:e> at baseline predicted 10-year cardiovascular mortality independently of adjustment for other risk factors in the diabetic patients (odds ratio [95% CI] 4.7 [1.1-19.3], P = 0.033) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Visual acuity deteriorated earlier in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients than in the control group although the cross-sectional frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMD</z:e> was nearly the same in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMD</z:e> was an independent risk factor for cardiovascular mortality in type 2 diabetic patients, but the background mechanism(s) behind this association is unknown </plain></SENT>
