<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: This study assessed the influence of various degrees of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal impairment</z:e> on the exposure of linagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor with a primarily non-renal route of excretion, in subjects with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Linagliptin pharmacokinetics was studied under single-dose and steady-state conditions in subjects with mild, moderate and severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal impairment</z:e> (with and without T2DM) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal disease</z:hpo> and compared with the pharmacokinetics in subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> renal function (with and without T2DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Renal excretion of unchanged linagliptin was &lt;7% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Under single-dose conditions, the degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal impairment</z:e> did not affect mean plasma linagliptin concentration-time profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These showed a similar decline and almost identical plasma concentrations 24 h postdosing in subjects with mild, moderate or severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal impairment</z:e> and in subjects with T2DM with and without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal impairment</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although there was a tendency towards slightly higher (20-60%) exposure in renally impaired subjects (with and without T2DM) compared with subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> renal function, the steady-state AUC and C(max) values showed a large overlap and were not affected by the degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal impairment</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The accumulation half-life of linagliptin ranged from 14-15 h in subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> renal function to 18 h in severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal impairment</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only a weak correlation (r(2) = 0.18) was seen between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance and steady-state exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Renal impairment</z:e> has only a minor effect on linagliptin pharmacokinetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Consequently, there will be no need for adjusting the linagliptin dose in renally impaired patients with T2DM </plain></SENT>
