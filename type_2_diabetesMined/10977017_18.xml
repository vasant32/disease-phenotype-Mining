<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate comorbidity and overall use and costs of medication for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Finnish individuals with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treated with drugs compared with sex- and age-matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: According to a cross-sectional population study using national registries, 116,224 individuals purchased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> medications in Finland in 1995 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The same number of nondiabetic individuals matched for sex, age, and area of residence were chosen as control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was used as a criterion for distinguishing between type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The criterion could be applied in 74% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 16,955 individuals were defined as having type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and 68,517 were defined as having type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comorbidity was determined by linkage with a national register including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> individuals entitled to special reimbursement for drug treatment for a range of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Data on use and costs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> medications prescribed were obtained from drug purchase records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">Cardiovascular diseases</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009644'>uremia</z:mp> were, as expected, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> diseases most closely associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Use of almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> kinds of medication was significantly greater in individuals with type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The greatest differences were observed in relation to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35554">cardiovascular drugs</z:chebi> and antibiotics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly low use of antiasthmatics was observed in individuals with both types of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, low use of <z:chebi fb="25" ids="35476">neuroleptics</z:chebi> was observed in type 1 diabetic individuals, and low use of hormone replacement therapy was observed in women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Total costs of medications for individuals with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were 3.5 times greater than those for nondiabetic control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The higher costs were mostly attributable to insulin therapy for individuals with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The higher costs for individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were related to the cost of medications other than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The possible selection bias in omitting diabetic individuals treated with diet only and individuals in whom <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> type could not be determined must be considered in interpreting the results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Greater use by and costs of medications for individuals with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than for nondiabetic individuals is related not only to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> treatment but also to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other kinds of medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Although drug treatment and the prevalence of several <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> conditions were overall greater in individuals with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> versus other individuals, some exceptions merit further study </plain></SENT>
