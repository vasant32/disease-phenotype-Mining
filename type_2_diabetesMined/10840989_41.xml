<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the prevalence of and risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262380" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">asymptomatic bacteriuria</z:e> (ASB) in women with and without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 636 nonpregnant women with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (type 1 and type 2) who were 18-75 years of age and had no abnormalities of the urinary tract, and 153 women without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were visiting the eye and trauma outpatient clinic (control subjects) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We defined ASB as the presence of at least 10(5) colony-forming units/ml of 1 or 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> species in a culture of clean-voided midstream urine from an individual without symptoms of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000010'>urinary tract infection</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">UTI</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of ASB was 26% in the diabetic women and 6% in the control subjects (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of ASB in women with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 21% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for ASB in type 1 diabetic women included a longer duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo>, and macroalbuminuria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of ASB was 29% in women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for ASB in type 2 diabetic women included age, macroalbuminuria, a lower BMI, and a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">UTI</z:e> during the previous year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No association was evident between current HbA1c level and the presence of ASB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of ASB is increased in women with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and might be added to the list of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> in these women </plain></SENT>
