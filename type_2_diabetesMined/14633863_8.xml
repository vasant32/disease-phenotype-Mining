<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed a genome-wide search to localize type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility genes in a recently genetically isolated population in the Netherlands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We identified 79 nuclear families with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were related within 13 generations and performed a 770-marker genome-wide scan search for shared <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six markers yielded a logarithm of odds (LOD) score &gt;0.59 (nominal P &lt; 0.05), of which 7 reached LOD scores &gt;1.17 (nominal P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The strongest evidence for a type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> locus was at marker D18S63 on chromosome 18p (LOD 2.3, P = 0.0006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This region was investigated further using additional markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For one of these markers (D18S1105), we found a significant association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (odds ratio 6.7 [95% CI 1.5-30.7], P = 0.005 for the 97-bp allele, assuming a dominant model), which increased when limiting the analysis to patients with high BMI (12.25 [2.1-71], P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A locus on chromosome 18p in patients with high BMI was suggested earlier by Parker et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our study is the first to confirm this locus </plain></SENT>
