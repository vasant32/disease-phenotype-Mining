<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies in humans and in rodents have produced conflicting results regarding the link between ZAG and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to examine the relationships between ZAG and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in cross-sectional and interventional studies.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSSerum ZAG (determined with ELISA) was compared with various parameters related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT), and newly diagnosed type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM), and in women with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000147'>polycystic ovary</z:hpo> syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCOS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamps were performed in healthy and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCOS</z:e> women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting were used to assess <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression of ZAG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effect of a glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 agonist on ZAG was studied in a 12-week liraglutide treatment trial.RESULTSCirculating ZAG was lower in patients with IGT and newly diagnosed T2DM than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Circulating ZAG correlated positively with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> and adiponectin, and correlated inversely with BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, body fat percentage, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, fasting insulin, HbA(1c), and homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-IR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, ZAG was independently associated with BMI, HOMA-IR, and adiponectin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ZAG <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein were decreased in adipose tissue of T2DM patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, circulating ZAG levels were lower in women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCOS</z:e> than in women with high insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Liraglutide treatment for 12 weeks significantly increased circulating ZAG levels.CONCLUSIONSWe conclude that ZAG may be an adipokine associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
