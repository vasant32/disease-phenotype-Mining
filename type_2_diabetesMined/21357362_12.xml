<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether this risk in individuals with impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism (IGM) or undiagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (UDD) is elevated relative to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism (NGM) or decreased relative to previously diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (PDD) has not been the subject of a systematic review/meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examined the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in IGM and UDD subjects relative to each other and to NGM and PDD subjects by reviewing the literature and conducting a meta-analysis of studies on this topic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: EMBASE and MEDLINE databases were searched for articles published up to May 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> studies that compared the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in subjects with IGM and UDD were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using fixed and random-effects models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The meta-analysis showed that the risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> was not increased in IGM versus NGM subjects (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.85-1.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> did not differ between individuals with UDD and individuals with either NGM (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.71-1.25) or IGM (OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.88-1.54) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, individuals with IGM or UDD both had a significantly lower risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> than individuals with PDD (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.48-0.73, and OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.45-0.74, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Results of this meta-analysis show that the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> is similar for NGM, IGM, and UDD subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>PDD subjects have an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> relative to IGM and UDD subjects </plain></SENT>
