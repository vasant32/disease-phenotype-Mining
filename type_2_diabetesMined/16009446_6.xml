<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examined the effect of probucol on progression of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a randomized, open trial on 102 type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients with clinical <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> (urinary albumin excretion &gt;300 mg/g Cr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty-one patients were assigned to probucol treatment (500 mg/day) and 51 to no probucol treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, 40 who had serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> &gt;or=2mg/dl at baseline were defined as advanced cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were followed for a maximum 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HbA1c levels were not different between two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">High-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> decreased significantly in probucol group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increase in urinary protein (g/day/month) was significantly greater in non-probucol than in probucol group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hemodialysis was initiated in 23 patients (10 in probucol group and 13 in non-probucol group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean interval to initiation of hemodialysis was significantly longer in probucol group (20.7+/-8.2 months) than in non-probucol group (11.3+/-7.4 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In advanced cases, increases of both serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> and urinary protein were significantly suppressed in probucol group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In advanced cases, the hemodialysis-free rate was significantly higher in probucol group than in non-probucol group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that probucol may suppress the progression of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
