<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this 26-week, multicentre, open-label, parallel-group trial, subjects poorly controlled with mono- or dual-oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> therapy were randomized 1 : 1 : 1 to receive a repaglinide/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> tablet either two times daily (BID) or three times daily (TID) or a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> tablet BID </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary objective comprised two hypotheses tested in a hierarchical order: (i) that treatment with the repaglinide/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> BID is non-inferior to that of a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> tablet BID as measured by changes in <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA1c) (results presented here) and (ii) if true, that treatment with the repaglinide/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> BID was non-inferior to that of the repaglinide/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> TID as measured by changes in HbA1c (results presented in a companion paper) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additional efficacy and safety end-points were also assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 561 subjects randomized, 383 completed the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reductions in HbA1c values became apparent at earlier times for repaglinide/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> BID treatment than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> BID, and final changes in HbA1c were not significantly different between treatment arms (p = 0.8186); thus, the predefined statistical criterion for non-inferiority was met </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall adverse event profiles were comparable between treatment groups, and no major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0745153" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemic episodes</z:e> were reported during the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The repaglinide/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> BID regimen showed efficacy that was non-inferior to that of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> BID regimen currently in clinical use and a more rapid reduction of HbA1c values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, repaglinide/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> BID is a clinically feasible alternative to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> BID </plain></SENT>
