<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On each day they were given a 500-kcal mixed meal plus an infusion of either porcine <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent insulinotropic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (GIP) (0.75 pmol/kg/min) or control solution (CS) from 0 to 30 min in random order </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Frequent measurements of plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, insulin and GIP concentrations were made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fasting GIP levels were similar on both days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the meal plus GIP infusion plasma GIP levels increased from a basal value of 7.6 +/- 1.5 pmol/1 to a peak of 88.6 +/- 5.4 pmol/1 at 30 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Following the meal infusion of CS GIP increased from a fasting level of 10.3 +/- 1.2 pmol/1 to a significantly lower peak of 58.0 +/- 8.3 pmol/1 at 60 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the meal plus GIP infusion GIP levels were higher at 10-45 min and at 90 min (P less than 0.05-0.001) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A supplementary infusion of porcine GIP with a mixed meal did not significantly alter the beta cell response or <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance in this group of patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
