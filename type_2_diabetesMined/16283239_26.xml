<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> were studied in two clinical trials in patients with inadequately controlled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (HbA1c &gt; or =7.5 and &lt; or =11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the first trial, patients currently receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> were randomised to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (15-45 mg/day, n=317) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi> (80-320 mg/day, n=313) add-on therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the second study, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (15-45 mg/day, n=319) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (850-2,550 mg/day, n=320) was added to sulphonylurea therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were force-titrated to the maximum tolerated dose of add-on therapy, which was maintained to the 2-year endpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between the groups with respect to HbA1c reduction from baseline to week 104 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Whether added to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> or sulphonylurea, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> caused highly significant greater decreases in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> and increases in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> from baseline to week 104 than treatments with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> add-on therapies (p&lt; or =0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> reductions noted with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> were maintained over time, with decreases of 16-18% at 1 year and 17-23% at 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> groups, the improvement in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> at 1 year was maintained, with 21-22% augmentations at 2 years (p&lt;0.001 between-group difference) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Small but statistically significant greater reductions in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> were observed with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi> vs <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> add-on to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> vs <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> add-on to sulphonylurea (p&lt;0.001 for between-group difference) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> groups, mean <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> at 2 years was similar to mean baseline <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: After 2 years, highly significant decreases in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> and increases in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> that were sustained over time or even improved were observed when <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> was added to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> or sulphonylurea therapy </plain></SENT>
