<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total 204 outpatients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were invited to complete a questionnaire using the Beck <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> inventory (BDI) to measure depressive symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Age, gender, body mass index, serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile, and a social history including marital status, occupation and educational background were also assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> was evaluated by examining the patients' medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diabetic patients who were not treated with anti-diabetic drugs were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the study subjects were classified into two groups based on their mode of therapy: the oral drug group and insulin group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The insulin group included patients treated with insulin-oral drug combinations as well as those treated solely with insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 32.4% of our diabetic subjects showed depressive symptoms with the criterion being a BDI score &gt; or = 16 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared to the oral drug group, the insulin group showed a significantly higher frequency of depressive symptoms (insulin group, 48.0%; oral drug group, 27.3%; p&lt;0.01) and higher BDI scores (insulin group, 16.6+/-10.7; oral drug group, 12.6+/-8.7; p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, after an adjustment for social factors, the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> and the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e>, the insulin group showed a significantly higher frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (odds ratio 4.38, 95% CI 1.66-11.6, p=0.003), compared to the oral drug group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The data showed that insulin treatment is related to the presence of depressive symptoms, and the importance of more careful psychological support of Korean insulin-treated type 2 diabetic patients is strongly suggested </plain></SENT>
