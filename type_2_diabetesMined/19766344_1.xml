<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A cohort derived from a national study population (FNRI-NNS, 1998) was revisited after 9 years to yield valuable data on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis among Filipinos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Six out of 13 national regions were included in the cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 1749 out of 2122 respondents (82.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>1386 (95.9%) consented to a fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FBG) test, and 1275 (88.2%) completed the 2h post-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (2HPG) load determination using whole blood capillary samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We observed a significant increase of mean FBGs (91.5mg/dL to 103.3mg/dL) from 1998 to 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 9-year incidence of T2DM was 16.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of T2DM was 28.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of pre-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, i.e., combined impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (IFG) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) was 31.3%; IFG was 17.5% and IGT was 23.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The study shows the alarming growth of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, IFG, and IGT in our country that warrants early aggressive intervention for prevention and management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We encourage the use of 2h post-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> load aside from FBG in screening for true diabetics, IFGs, and IGTs </plain></SENT>
