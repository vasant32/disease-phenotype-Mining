<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is a complex disease that is accompanied by elevated levels of nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs), which contribute to β-cell dysfunction and β-cell loss, referred to as lipotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Experimental evidence suggests that <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> is involved in lipotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we analyzed the molecular mechanisms of reactive oxygen species-mediated lipotoxicity in insulin-producing RINm5F cells and INS-1E cells as well as in primary rat islet cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The toxicity of saturated NEFAs with different chain lengths upon insulin-producing cells was determined by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51240">propidium iodide</z:chebi> (PI) viability assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Catalase or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase overexpressing cells were used to analyze the nature and the cellular compartment of reactive oxygen species formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With the new H₂O₂-sensitive fluorescent protein HyPer H₂O₂ formation induced by exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15756">palmitic acid</z:chebi> was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Only long-chain (&gt;C14) saturated NEFAs were toxic to insulin-producing cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of catalase in the peroxisomes and in the cytosol, but not in the mitochondria, significantly reduced H₂O₂ formation and protected the cells against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15756">palmitic acid</z:chebi>-induced toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With the HyPer protein, H₂O₂ generation was directly detectable in the peroxisomes of RINm5F and INS-1E insulin-producing cells as well as in primary rat islet cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that H₂O₂ formation in the peroxisomes rather than in the mitochondria are responsible for NEFA-induced toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we propose a new concept of fatty acid-induced β-cell lipotoxicity mediated via reactive oxygen species formation through peroxisomal β- oxidation </plain></SENT>
