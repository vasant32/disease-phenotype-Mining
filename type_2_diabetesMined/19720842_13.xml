<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of psychosocial stress at work on risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, adjusting for conventional risk factors, among a sample of British, white-collar, middle-aged men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a prospective analysis (1991-2004) from the Whitehall II cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The current sample consists of 5,895 Caucasian middle-aged civil servants free from <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was ascertained by an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test supplemented by self-reports at baseline and four consecutive waves of data collection including two screening phases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The job strain and iso-strain models were used to assess psychosocial work stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Iso-strain in the workplace was associated with a twofold higher risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in age-adjusted analysis in women but not in men (hazard ratio 1.94 [95% CI 1.17-3.21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This effect remained robust to adjustment for socioeconomic position and outside work stressors and was only attenuated by 20% after adjustment for health behaviors, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and other type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Psychosocial work stress was an independent predictor of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among women after a 15-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This association was not explained by potential confounding and mediating factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>More evidence from prospective studies using the same work stress models is needed to support the current findings and provide further information on sex differences </plain></SENT>
