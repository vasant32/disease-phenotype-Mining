<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe cultural and family challenges to illness management in foreign-born Chinese American patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and their spouses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was an interpretive comparative interview study with 20 foreign-born Chinese American couples (n = 40) living with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multiple (six to seven) semistructured interviews with each couple in individual, group, and couple settings elicited beliefs about <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and narratives of care within the family and community </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interpretive narrative and thematic analysis were completed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A separate respondent group of 19 patients and spouses who met the inclusion criteria reviewed and confirmed the themes developed from the initial couples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cultural and family challenges to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> management within foreign-born Chinese American families included how 1) <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> symptoms challenged family harmony, 2) dietary prescriptions challenged food beliefs and practices, and 3) disease management requirements challenged established family role responsibilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Culturally nuanced care with immigrant Chinese Americans requires attentiveness to the social context of disease management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients' and families' disease management decisions are seldom made independent of their concerns for family well-being, family face, and the reciprocal responsibilities required by varied family roles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Framing disease recommendations to include cultural concerns for balance and significant food rituals are warranted </plain></SENT>
