<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate if high-serum ferritin has long-term impact on response to treatment and the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We analysed the record of 90 consecutive type 2 diabetic subjects who had serum ferritin level determined soon after diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and who also had long-term follow-up data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with higher serum ferritin level had slightly worse <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>, blood pressure and liver enzyme levels at the end of follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, ferritin level had no impact on the initial or final requirements for diabetic medication and the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0003281'>elevated serum ferritin</z:hpo> is a marker of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, it is not necessarily a bad prognostic indicator that should affect the clinician's approach to management </plain></SENT>
