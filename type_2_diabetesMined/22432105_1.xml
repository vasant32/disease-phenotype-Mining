<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Glycemic control in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> generally worsens over time, requiring intensification of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5001">Fenofibrate</z:chebi> Intervention and Event Lowering in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> (FIELD) trial provided the opportunity to observe glycemic control in a real-world setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed the adequacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi>, and insulin to maintain glycemic control and their effects on weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> control was measured at baseline and yearly for a median of 5 years in the 4,900 patients from the nonintervention arm of this study allocated to placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median HbA(1c) was 6.9% at baseline and increased by an average of 0.22% over 5 years (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median weight was 86.3 kg at baseline and decreased by 0.4 kg over 5 years (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Baseline therapy was lifestyle measures only in 27%, oral agents without insulin in 59%, and insulin in 14% (7% also taking oral agents) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Over 5 years, insulin use increased to 32% (21% also taking oral agents) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Use of oral agents remained similar at 56% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only 2% of patients at baseline and 4% after 5 years were taking oral agents other than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Initiation of insulin therapy in 855 patients produced a sustained reduction of HbA(1c) from a median of 8.2 to 7.7%, with a <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> of 4.6 kg over 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: With intensification of traditional therapies, glycemic control deteriorated very little over 5 years in a large cohort of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, the requirement for insulin therapy doubled, at the expense of significant <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> and risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
