<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> ingestion inhibits hypothalamic neuronal activity </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Restoring energy balance by reducing caloric intake and losing weight are important therapeutic strategies in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that caloric restriction would have beneficial effects on the hypothalamic neuronal response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> ingestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 10 male type 2 diabetic patients before and after a 4-day very-low-calorie diet (VLCD) at a 3.0 Tesla scanner using a blood oxygen level-dependent technique for measuring neuronal activity in the hypothalamus in response to an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> load </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hypothalamic signals were normalized to baseline value, and differences between the pre- and postdiet condition were tested using paired t tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pre-VLCD scans showed no response of the hypothalamus to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> intake (i.e., no signal decrease after <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> intake was observed) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Post-VLCD scans showed a prolonged signal decrease after <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> ingestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results of the current study demonstrate that short-term caloric restriction readily normalizes hypothalamic responsiveness to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> ingestion in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
