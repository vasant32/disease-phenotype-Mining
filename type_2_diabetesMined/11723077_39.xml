<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Daily <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> profiles were assessed in non-insulin-treated type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Outpatients at the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> clinic (n = 371; one daily plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> profile) and at home (n = 30; five daily blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> profiles over 1 month) as well as inpatients (n = 455; profile of plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> on the day of admission) were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects had plasma/blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> assessment before and 2-3 h after breakfast, lunch, and dinner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HbA(1c) was also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After the meals many subjects had <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels &gt;8.9 mmol/l (160 mg/dl) and/or <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excursions &gt;2.2 mmol/l (40 mg/dl) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was also often found when HbA(1c) was satisfactory (&lt;7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The coefficients of simple correlation among plasma/blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> at different times of the day ranged from 0.52 to 0.88 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Correlations between HbA(1c) and plasma/blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> at different times of the day ranged from 0.44 to 0.67 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The strongest correlation was between HbA(1c) and mean daily <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (r = 0.57-0.69) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multiple regression analyses showed that premeal but not postmeal plasma/blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were independent predictors of HbA(1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that 1) the majority of non-insulin-treated type 2 diabetic patients have exaggerated plasma/blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excursions with meals, and many of them have higher-than-recommended <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations 2 h after the meals; 2) plasma/blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels throughout the day are not as strongly interrelated as one might believe; and 3) HbA(1c) is more related to preprandial than postprandial plasma/blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings have potential implications for treatment and monitoring of metabolic control in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
