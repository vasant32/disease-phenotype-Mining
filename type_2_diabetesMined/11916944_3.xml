<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of the many animal models used in the study of non-insulin-dependent (type 2) <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the JCR:LA-cp rat is unique in that it develops <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and manifests both peripheral and coronary vasculopathies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this animal model, arterial vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) from homozygous <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (cp/cp) rats, but not from age-matched healthy (+/+ or + /cp, collectively defined +/?) littermates, display an " activated" phenotype in vitro and in vivo and have an elevated level of cAMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this report, we confirm that cp/cp rat aortic VSMCs have an elevated level of PDE3 activity and show that only particulate PDE3 (PDE3B) activity is elevated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="?"><plain>In marked contrast to results obtained in + / </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>VSMCs, simultaneous activation of adenylyl cyclase and inhibition of PDE3 activity in cp/cp VSMCs synergistically increased cAMP </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>VSMCs, PDE3 inhibition did markedly potentiate the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42471">forskolin</z:chebi>-induced inhibition of migration of cp/cp-derived VSMCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although PDE3 activity was elevated in cp/cp rat aortic VSMCs, levels of expression of cytosolic PDE3 (PDE3A) and PDE3B in +/? and cp/cp VSMCs, as well as activation of these enzymes following activation of the cAMP-protein kinase A signaling cascade, were not different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data are consistent with an increased role for PDE3 in regulating cAMP-dependent signaling in cp/cp VSMCs and identify PDE3 as a cellular activity potentially responsible for the phenotype of cp/cp VSMCs </plain></SENT>
