<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The Comparative Outcomes Study of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> Intervention versus Conventional (COSMIC) Approach Study was a randomized, open-label, active-comparator, parallel-group, 1-year trial in type 2 diabetic patients suboptimally controlled on diet or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (n = 7,227) or other usual care treatments (n = 1,505) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was the incidence of SAEs, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SAEs occurred in 10.3% (95% CI 9.6-11.1%) of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> group and in 11.0% (9.5-12.7%) of the usual care group (P = 0.431) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003128'>Lactic acidosis</z:hpo> did not occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo>-cause mortality (1.1% [0.9-1.4%] vs. 1.3% [0.8-2.0%], P = 0.596) and hospitalization (9.4% [8.8-10.1%] vs. 10.4% [8.9-12.1%], P = 0.229) were similar between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of SAEs was similar between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003128'>Lactic acidosis</z:hpo> was not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> may be safely prescribed for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> if contraindications and warnings are respected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates the utility of large, simple trials for risk evaluation of treatments for common diseases </plain></SENT>
