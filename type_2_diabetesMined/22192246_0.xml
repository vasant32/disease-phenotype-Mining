<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate whether patients taking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> for type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) have improved glycaemic control without compromising tolerability by adding an agent with a complementary mechanism of action vs. uptitrating <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adults with T2DM and glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA1c) between 7.0 and 10.5% receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> extended release (XR) 1500 mg/day for â‰¥8 weeks were randomized to receive saxagliptin 5 mg added to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> XR 1500 mg (n = 138) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> XR uptitrated to 2000 mg/day (n = 144) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Endpoints were change from baseline to week 18 in HbA1c (primary), 120-min postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi>), fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) and the proportion of patients achieving HbA1c &lt;7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At week 18, the adjusted mean reduction from baseline HbA1c was -0.88% for saxagliptin + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> XR and -0.35% for uptitrated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> XR (difference, -0.52%; p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For 120-min <z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi> and FPG, differences in adjusted mean change from baseline between saxagliptin + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> XR and uptitrated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> XR were -1.3 mmol/l (-23.32 mg/dl) (p = 0.0013) and -0.73 mmol/l (-13.18 mg/dl) (p = 0.0030), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>More patients achieved HbA1c &lt;7.0% with saxagliptin + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> XR than with uptitrated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> XR (37.2 vs. 26.1%; p = 0.0459) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proportions of patients experiencing any adverse events (AEs) were generally similar between groups; neither group showed any notable difference in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> or gastrointestinal AEs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Adding saxagliptin to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> XR provided superior glycaemic control compared with uptitrating <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> XR without the emergence of additional safety concerns </plain></SENT>
