<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: From 1992 to 1997, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> schoolchildren aged 6-18 years were screened for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Taiwan Province </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This cohort consisted of 1,966 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 1,780 randomly selected subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fasting glycemia (NFG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Questionnaire interviewing was designed to classify <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The birth weight was obtained from the Taiwan's Birth Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After merging the data, there were 978 subjects, including 429 with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 549 with of NFG enrolled in the present analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The odds ratios (95% CI) for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, after adjusting age, sex, BMI, family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and socioeconomic status, were 2.91 (1.25-6.76) for children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birth weight</z:hpo> (&lt;2,500 g) and 1.78 (1.04-3.06) for those with high birth weight (&gt; or =4,000 g) when compared with the referent group (birth weight 3,000-3,499 g) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was still 64% higher in the high birth weight group [odds ratio (OR) 1.64 (95% CI 0.91-2.96)], even after adjustment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> mellitus (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were born with high birth weight were more likely to have a higher BMI and diastolic blood pressure as well as a higher family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birth weight</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A U-shaped relationship between birth weight and risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was found in the schoolchildren aged 6-18 years in Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Schoolchildren with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were born with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birth weight</z:hpo> had different metabolic phenotypes compared with those born with high birth weight </plain></SENT>
