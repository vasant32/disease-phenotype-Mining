<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">Thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> are a class of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> agents that are known to improve insulin sensitivity in various animal models of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The improved insulin sensitivity may be achieved either by systemic insulin sensitization or by direct action of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma on the transcription of genes involved in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Evidence supporting the direct action of PPAR-gamma on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism is observed in the genes involved in insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We already showed that GLUT2 and beta-glucokinase were directly activated by PPAR-gamma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recently, we have identified and characterized the functional PPAR response element in the GLUT2 and liver type glucokinase (LGK) promoter of the liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is well known that adipose tissue plays a crucial role in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> action of PPAR-gamma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, PPAR-gamma can directly affect liver and pancreatic beta-cells to improve <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis </plain></SENT>
