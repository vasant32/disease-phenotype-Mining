<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A postal case-history based questionnaire describing a male patient (previously not tested for MA) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who had several risk markers for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 2078GPs from nine European countries were included, with response rates varying from 7% to 43% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> GPs recommended annual testing for MA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty-five to 77% (depending on country) of GPs required more than one positive test to diagnose MA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The absolute increase in the percentages of GPs who would supplement the patient's drug treatment if MA developed was: for anginotensin converting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23924">enzyme inhibitors</z:chebi> (ACEIs) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> receptor blockers (ARBs) 23-50% (depending on country), for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> 0-19%, for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15365">acetylsalicylic acid</z:chebi> 2-13%, and for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi> (tablets and insulin) 0-33% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proportion of GPs recommending <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four possible treatment modalities was low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Guidelines for diagnosing MA were partly followed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ACEIs and ARBs were recommended when MA was present, but the recommended multifactorial treatment of cardiovascular risk markers was not implemented </plain></SENT>
