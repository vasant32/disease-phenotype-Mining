<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ossabaw swine develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the hallmarks of MetS including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> when being fed excess calorie atherogenic diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that Ossabaw swine with MetS would exhibit increased platelet reactivity compared with lean pigs without MetS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ossabaw swine were fed high caloric, atherogenic diet for 44 weeks to induce MetS (n = 10) and were compared with lean controls without MetS that had been fed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> calorie standard diet (n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Light transmittance aggregometry was performed using <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">diphosphate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>), collagen, thrombin, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> (AA) at different concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dose response curves and EC50 were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> tolerance testing and intravascular ultrasound study of coronary arteries were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MetS pigs compared with lean controls were morbidly <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, showed evidence of arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020443" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated cholesterol</z:e>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high-density lipoprotein</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Platelets from MetS pigs were more sensitive to <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-induced platelet aggregation than leans (EC50: 1.83 ± 1.3 μM vs 3.64 ± 2.2 μM; P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MetS pigs demonstrated higher platelet aggregation in response to collagen than lean pigs (area under the curve: 286 ± 74 vs 198 ± 123; P = 0.037) and a trend for heightened response to AA (AUC: 260 ± 151 vs 178 ± 145; P = 0.13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was found for platelet aggregation in response to thrombin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MetS in Ossabaw swine is associated with increased reactivity of platelets to <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> and collagen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The Ossabaw swine may be a practical, large animal model for the study of certain aspects of platelet pathophysiology and examine vascular devices in a metabolic environment comparable to humans with MetS </plain></SENT>
