<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Only in the last decade did modeling studies predict, and knockout experiments confirm, that type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is a "2-hit" disease in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> is necessarily accompanied by beta-cell defect(s) preventing the compensatory upregulation of insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This long- delayed insight was associated with the development of a constant, the "disposition index," describing the beta-cell sensitivity-secretion relationship as a rectangular hyperbola </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Shifts in insulin sensitivity are accompanied by compensatory alterations in beta-cell sensitivity to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Insulin-sensitive subjects do not require a massive insulin response to exogenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> to maintain a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>But if their insulin sensitivity decreases by 80%, as in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878751" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">late pregnancy</z:e>, they need a fivefold greater insulin response to achieve an identical disposition index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> have an insulin response similar to that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers; at first glance, this suggests similar islet function, but the utility of the disposition index is to normalize this response to the amplitude of third trimester <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, revealing severe beta-cell deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The index is a quantitative, convenient, and accurate tool in analyzing epidemiologic data and identifying incipient <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Separate major issues remain, however: the causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, the causes of the failure of adequate beta-cell compensation in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and the nature of the signal(s) from insulin-resistant tissues that fail to elicit the appropriate beta-cell increment in sensitivity to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and other stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The disposition index is likely to remain the most accurate physiologic measure for testing hypotheses and solutions to these challenges in whole organisms </plain></SENT>
