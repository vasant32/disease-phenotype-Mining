<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Prevention Program (DPP) lifestyle intervention is a cost-effective strategy to prevent type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but it is unclear how this intervention could be financed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We explored whether this intervention could be offered in a way that allows return on investment for private health insurers while remaining attractive for consumers, employers, and Medicare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used the DPP and other published reports to build a Markov simulation model to estimate the lifetime progression of disease, costs, and quality of life for adults with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The model assumed a health-payer perspective and compared DPP lifestyle and placebo interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Primary outcomes included cumulative incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, direct medical costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and cost per QALY gained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with placebo, providing the lifestyle intervention at age 50 years could prevent 37% of new cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> before age 65, at a cost of $1,288 per QALY gained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A private payer could reimburse $655 (24%) of the $2,715 in total discounted intervention costs during the first 3 intervention years and still recover <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these costs in the form of medical costs avoided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>If Medicare paid up to $2,136 in intervention costs over the 15-year period before participants reached age 65, it could recover those costs in the form of future medical costs avoided beginning at age 65 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cost-sharing strategies to offer the DPP lifestyle intervention for eligible people between ages 50 and 64 could provide financial return on investment for private payers and long-term benefits for Medicare </plain></SENT>
