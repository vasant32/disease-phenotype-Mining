<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aims were to evaluate the reliability of the algorithms and the effectiveness of a proposed stepwise screening programme for Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in general practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The screening programme had four steps: (i) mail-distributed self-administered risk-chart; (ii) screening tests: random blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (RBG) and HbA(1)c; (iii) diagnostic procedure 1 for fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FBG) (if RBG &gt;/=5.5 mmol/l or HbA(1)c &gt;/=6.1%); and (iv) OGTT as diagnostic procedure 2 (if 5.6&lt;/=FBG&lt;6.1 mmol/l or HbA(1)c &gt;/=6.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism were classified according to the WHO 1999 criteria, based on capillary whole blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The subjects were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients between 40 and 69 years of age ( n=60,926) who were registered in 88 general practices and had not been previously diagnosed with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 11,263 individuals had a high-risk risk-score and attended the screening consultation (step 1 test-positive) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these, 30.1% needed diagnostic tests (step 2 test-positive) and 27.2% of these needed an OGTT (step 3 test-positive) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The test-positive proportions were equal to the proportions obtained in data from a population-based survey from Step 2 onwards, and the algorithms were thus reliable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The identification rate was only 19% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> prevalent undiagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> according to a recently published prevalence estimate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This was due to a large dropout rate among high-risk individuals prior to entry into the programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Population-based mail-distributed stepwise screening for Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in general practice is ineffective, despite reliable screening algorithms, primarily because many high-risk individuals fail to participate </plain></SENT>
