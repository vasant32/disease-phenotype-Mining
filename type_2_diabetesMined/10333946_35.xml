<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We examined the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30314">lipoic acid</z:chebi> (LA), a cofactor of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase complex (PDH), on insulin sensitivity (SI) and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> effectiveness (SG) and on serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> levels after oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests (OGTTs) and modified frequently sampled intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests (FSIGTTs) in lean (n = 10) and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (n = 10) patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: FSIGTT data were analyzed by minimal modeling technique to determine SI and SG before and after oral treatment (600 mg, twice a day, for 4 weeks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> levels of diabetic patients after <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> loading were compared with those of lean (n = 10) and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (n = 10) healthy control subjects in which SI and SG were also determined from FSIGTT data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fasting <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> levels were significantly increased in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These metabolites did not exceed elevated fasting concentrations after <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> loading in lean patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, a twofold increase of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> levels was measured in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LA treatment was associated with increased SG in both diabetic groups (lean 1.28 +/- 0.14 to 1.93 +/- 0.13; <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> 1.07 +/- 0.11 to 1.53 +/- 0.08 x 10(-2) min-1, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Higher SI and lower fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> were measured in lean diabetic patients only (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">Lactate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> before and after <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> loading were approximately 45% lower in lean and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> diabetic patients after LA treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of lean and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> diabetic patients with LA prevents <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>-induced increments of serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> levels and increases SG </plain></SENT>
