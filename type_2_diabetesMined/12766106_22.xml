<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Subjects with stable, insulin-treated type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> performed SMBG using an electronic blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> meter before <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> meals and at bedtime for 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Baseline data were collected on demographics, clinical characteristics, diet, and exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HbA(1c) was measured at baseline, at 4 weeks, and at 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After the intensified monitoring period, subjects resumed their usual monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HbA(1c) was then measured at 24, 37, and 52 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate linear regression was used to determine the effect of monitoring on glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 201 subjects completed the monitoring period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The baseline HbA(1c) (8.10 +/- 1.67%) decreased during the monitoring period by 0.30 +/- 0.68% (P &lt; 0.001) at 4 weeks and by 0.36 +/- 0.88% (P &lt; 0.001) at 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although entry HbA(1c) and compliance independently predicted the week 8 HbA(1c) (r = 0.862, P &lt; 0.001), standardized regression analysis found that compliance with the SMBG protocol influenced the week 8 HbA(1c) more than age, sex, BMI, exercise level, carbohydrate consumption, or treatment intensity at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, SMBG benefited only subjects whose testing compliance exceeded 75% or with an entry HbA(1c) &gt;8.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Decreases in HbA(1c) (-0.31 +/- 1.17%, P = 0.001) persisted in the 159 subjects followed for 52 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intensified blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring improved glycemic control in a large cohort of stable, insulin-treated veterans with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>SMBG provided a strong stimulus for improved self-care resulting in clinically important and sustained reductions in HbA(1c) </plain></SENT>
