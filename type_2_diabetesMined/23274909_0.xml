<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2D) is characterized by β-cell dysfunction and the subsequent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of insulin production, usually in a context of increased peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>T2D patients are routinely treated with oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> agents such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> or DPP-4 antagonists, which promote <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>- and incretin-dependent insulin secretion, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, insulin secretion may also be induced by neural stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we report the expression of Nogo-A in β-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nogo-A is a membrane protein that inhibits neurite outgrowth and cell migration in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We observed that Nogo-A-deficient mice display improved insulin secretion and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> clearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was associated with a stronger parasympathetic input and higher sensitivity of β-cells to the cholinergic analog <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3385">carbachol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Insulin secretion was also improved in diabetic db/db mice treated with neutralizing antibody against Nogo-A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Together, these findings suggest that promoting the vagal stimulation of insulin secretion through the selective inhibition of Nogo-A could be a novel therapeutic approach in T2D </plain></SENT>
