<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The clinical picture of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) is formed by impairment in insulin secretion and resistance to insulin action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As a result of intensive efforts of the scientists around the world mutations and polymorphisms in a number of genes were linked with monogenic and polygenic forms of T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two major strategies were used in this research: genome scanning and the candidate gene approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Monogenic forms, despite their rarity, constitute a field where substantial progress has been made in the dissection of the molecular background of T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Monogenic forms of T2DM with profound defect in insulin secretion include subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004904'>maturity onset diabetes of the young</z:hpo> (MODY), maternally inherited <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo> (MIDD) caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> mutations, and rare cases resulting from insulin gene mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The majority of proteins associated with MODY are transcription factors, such as hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha (HNF-4alpha), HNF-1alpha, insulin promoter factor-1 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IPF</z:e>-1), HNF-1beta, and NEUROD1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They influence expression of the other genes through regulation of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only MODY2 form is associated with glucokinase, a key regulatory enzyme of the beta cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There are striking differences in the clinical picture of MODY associated with glucokinase and MODY associated with transcription factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three monogenic forms of T2DM characterized by severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> are the consequence of mutations in the PPARgamma, ATK2, and insulin receptor genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with monogenic T2DM, particularly with MODY, sometimes, develop discrete extra-pancreatic phenotypes; for example, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> abnormalities or a variety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1691228" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cystic renal diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Efforts aiming to identify genes responsible for more common, polygenic forms of T2DM were less effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These forms of T2DM have a middle/late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> and occur with both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948379" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">impaired insulin secretion</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Their clinical picture is created by the interaction of environmental and genetic factors, such as frequent polymorphisms of many genes, not just of one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These polymorphisms may be localized in the coding or regulatory parts of the genes and are present, although with different frequencies, in T2DM patients as well as in healthy populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Sequence differences in a few genes have been associated, so far, with complex, polygenic forms of T2DM, for example, calpain 10, PPARgamma, KCJN11, and insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In addition, some evidence exists that genes, such as adiponectin, IRS-1, and some others may also influence the susceptibility to T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>It is expected that in the nearest future more T2DM susceptibility genes will be identified </plain></SENT>
