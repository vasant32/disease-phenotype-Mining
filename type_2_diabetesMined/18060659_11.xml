<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In general practices in Denmark, stepwise screening for type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> in persons aged 40 to 69 years included a risk questionnaire, random blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, HbA1c, fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and an OGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 1,821 individuals with IGT or isolated IFG (WHO 1999) were re-invited after 1 and 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Follow-up data on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> measurements were available in 1,510 individuals and additional clinical data in 1,002 collected at the 3-year visits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regression models using interval censoring were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Progression rates from IFG and IGT to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> over 3.5 years were 11.8 and 17.0 per 100 person-years, respectively and were particularly high in the first year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Baseline determinants of progression were: IFG: <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> measures, BMI [per kg/m2, rate ratio (RR) 1.04 (95% CI, 1.01-1.08)] and triacylglycerol [per twofold increase, RR 2.19 (1.49-3.22)]; and IGT: <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> measures and known <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> [RR 1.46 (1.11-1.93)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Weight reduction and decreased triacylglycerol were inversely associated with development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in IFG individuals [per 1 kg/year, RR 0.81 (0.66-0.98) and per 1 mmol l(-1) year(-1), RR 0.08 (0.01-0.51), respectively], whereas in IGT participants only weight reduction was inversely associated [per 1 kg/year, RR 0.80 (0.67-0.96)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Higher levels of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> measures, larger BMI, known <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and hypertriacylglycerolaemia are significant determinants of progression in high-risk screened individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>Weight loss</z:hpo> of 1 kg/year or reduction of hypertriacylglycerolaemia markedly reduced the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
