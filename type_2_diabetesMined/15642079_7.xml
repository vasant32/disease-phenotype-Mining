<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in citizens of two rural communities in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The subjects were 102 men and 126 women over the age of 30 years selected from 1035 citizens who had undergone medical examinations in the towns of Tanno and Sobetsu, Hokkaido, in 1991 and 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Those who were on medication for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020473" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperlipidaemia</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> and cerebral vessel disease were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The simple index to determine <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> [i.e. homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-R) &gt; or = 1.73] was used, and subjects who were determined to be positive for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> according to this index in 1991 were also excluded in order to determine the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in subjects who had no abnormalities other than <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> level, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> level, blood sugar level, serum insulin value and HOMA-R were measured in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects in 1991 and in 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the subjects were divided into two groups according to BMI, a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group consisting of subjects with BMI &lt; 25 and an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> group consisting of subjects with BMI &gt; or = 25 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also compared the incidences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> groups of subjects who were newly determined to be positive for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> on the basis of data obtained from medical examinations conducted in 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> was significantly higher in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> group than in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group (25.0 vs. 4.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results of logistic regression analysis showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> was closely related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and that the relative risk of development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> adjusted for age, sex, SBP, FPG and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> was 3.193 (95% CI 1.085-9.401) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> was significantly higher in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> group than in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group in this study, suggesting that improvement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> is important for prevention of the occurrence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or atherosclerotic disease based on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
