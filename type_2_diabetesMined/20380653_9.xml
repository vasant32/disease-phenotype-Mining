<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A double-blinded, placebo-controlled study over 12 weeks in which 24 patients with T2DM were randomized to receive either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> (Januvia) 100 mg qd or placebo as an add-on therapy to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In week 0, 1 and 12 patients underwent a meal test and a 90-min 20 mM hyperglycaemic clamp with 5 g of l-arginine infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Main outcome measure was postprandial total glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> 1 (GLP-1) concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additional measures were insulin and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, glycaemic control, intact and total <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> YY (PYY) and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent insulinotropic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (GIP), and intact glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> 2 (GLP-2) and GLP-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> n = 12, age: 59.5 (39-64) years, HbA1c: 8.0 (7.3-10.0)%, BMI: 33.2 (29.3-39.4); placebo n = 12, age: 60 (31-72) years, HbA1c: 7.7 (7.1-9.8)%, BMI: 30.7 (25.7-40.5)] [median (range)] completed the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">Sitagliptin</z:chebi> treatment improved glycaemic control, had no effect on total GLP-1, GIP or intact GLP-2, but reduced total PYY and PYY(3- 36), and increased PYY(1- 36) and intact incretin hormones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">Sitagliptin</z:chebi> improved first and second phases of beta cell secretion and maximal secretory capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> effects were achieved after 1 week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant changes occurred in the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The postprandial responses of total GLP-1 and GIP and intact GLP-2 were unaltered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>PYY degradation was prevented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> and non-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> induced beta cell secretion was improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in responses to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> between 1 and 12 weeks of treatment </plain></SENT>
