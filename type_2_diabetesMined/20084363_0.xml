<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine the optimal frequency of telephone contact by nurse practitioners that was necessary to prevent glycaemic relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This parallel, randomised controlled trial ran from June 2002 to February 2006 at an academic medical centre, studying 164 type 2 diabetic patients who had recently achieved glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Participants were randomly assigned by sequential, concealed, computer-generated allocation to a 2 year maintenance strategy consisting of: (1) routine follow-up (n = 54); (2) routine follow-up and quarterly telephone contact (n = 55); or (3) routine follow-up and monthly telephone contact (n = 55) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blinding was not possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was cumulative incidence of glycaemic relapse, defined as an increase in HbA(1c) of &gt; or =1%; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cumulative incidence and prevalent proportions were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Weight change and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> were also assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants randomised were included in the analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The study was completed by 90% of participants and intervention fidelity was high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At 24 months, the cumulative incidence of relapse was 41% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At 12 months, prevalent proportions of relapse were 20%, 14% and 15% for control, quarterly contact and monthly contact, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>At 24 months, they were 25%, 21% and 29%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant difference in cumulative incidence or prevalent proportions of relapse among the study arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Adverse events did not differ between study arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: This first randomised controlled trial to test an intervention to prevent glycaemic relapse found that regularly scheduled telephone contact by a nurse practitioner was no more effective than routine follow-up care in preventing glycaemic relapse </plain></SENT>
