<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In latent autoimmune <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in adults (LADA), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> has been reported to be significantly lower than in autoantibody-negative type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2DM), but whether this might be related to differences in body mass index (BMI) has not been excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, previous studies have used limiting inclusive criteria for LADA, requiring only the presence of GADA or IA-2A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To apply more inclusive criteria for LADA, consistent with recent recommendations, we defined LADA by clinical manifestations characteristic of T2DM, but with the presence of any combination of GADA, IA-2A, ICA, or <z:mp ids='MP_0004157'>IAA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We recruited 43 LADA patients, 70 T2DM patients, and 150 non-diabetic controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo> was assessed by both the homeostasis model assessment and the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index, and BMI was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in LADA is equivalent to that of T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> is assessed as a function of BMI, both diabetic populations demonstrated an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> equally greater than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The interaction between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and BMI in the two diabetic groups was significantly different from that demonstrated in non-diabetic controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In summary, LADA demonstrates <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> of similar magnitude to T2DM, but with the concurrent component of an immune attack against the pancreatic beta-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>LADA patients may be at significant risk for metabolic consequences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> other than <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism, such as those described in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As complications and treatment regimens specific to LADA are realized, improved means of identification of LADA will become increasingly important </plain></SENT>
