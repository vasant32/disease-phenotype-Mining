<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy were randomized to add on treatment with Vildagliptin or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">Glimepiride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A standardized test meal was given at baseline, after 12 and 24 weeks of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Insulin, PI and blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> values were measured in the fasting state and postprandial for 300 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fasting PI levels significantly decreased in the Vildagliptin group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The area under the curve for the postprandial release of PI decreased during Vildagliptin and increased during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">Glimepiride</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proinsulin to insulin ratio declined in the Vildagliptin group, whereas it did not change significantly in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">Glimepiride</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Addition of Vildagliptin to ongoing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> treatment reconstitutes the disproportionality of the proinsulin to insulin secretion from the β cell </plain></SENT>
