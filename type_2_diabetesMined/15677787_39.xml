<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the perinatal outcome and the frequency of maternal complications in pregnancies of women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during 1996-2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Medical records of 61 consecutive singleton pregnancies in women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from 1996 to 2001 were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pregnancy outcome was compared with that of pregnant women with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during 1996-2000, the background population, and pregnant women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during 1980-1992 from the same department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The perinatal mortality in pregnancies complicated by type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (4/61, 6.6%) was increased four- and ninefold, respectively, and the rate of major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1705254" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital malformations</z:e> (4/60, 6.7%) was more than doubled, although not statistically significant, compared with type 1 diabetic pregnancies and the background population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The glycemic control was similar or better in women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with women with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression analysis in the pooled group of pregnancies with pregestational <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from 1996 to 2001 showed that high HbA(1c) at admission and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were independently associated with a serious adverse fetal outcome (perinatal mortality and/or major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1705254" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital malformations</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The perinatal mortality and the rate of major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1705254" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital malformations</z:e> in type 2 diabetic pregnancies have increased during the last decade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The perinatal outcome of pregnancies in women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during 1996-2001 is poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is worse than the outcome of pregnancies in women with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the background population in the same period, as well as in women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> studied during 1982-1990 </plain></SENT>
