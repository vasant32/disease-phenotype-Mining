<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Controversial data have been reported regarding Akt defective activation in the muscle of type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because three Akt isoforms exist, each having a distinct physiological role, we investigated the contribution of isoform-specific defects to insulin signalling in human muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The phosphorylation pattern and kinase activity of each Akt isoform were compared in primary myotubes from healthy control participants and type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylation of Ser(473) and of Thr(308) in each isoform was determined after immunoprecipitation in myotubes treated or not with insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Muscle cells from diabetic patients displayed defective insulin action and a drastic reduction of insulin-stimulated activity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Akt isoforms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was associated with specific defects of their phosphorylation pattern in response to insulin, with impaired Akt2- (and to a lower extent Akt3-) Ser(473) phosphorylation, and with altered Akt1-Thr(308) phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These defects were not due to faulty <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16749">phosphoinositide</z:chebi>-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) production or activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Rather, we found higher levels of the Akt2-Ser(473)-specific protein phosphatase PH domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase 1 (PHLPP1) in muscle from diabetic patients, which may contribute to the alteration of Akt2-Ser(473) phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These results suggest that several mechanisms affecting Akt isoforms, including deregulated production of PHLPP1, could underlie the alterations of skeletal muscle insulin signalling in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Taking into account the recently described isoform-specific metabolic functions of Akt, our results provide mechanistic insight that may contribute to the defective regulation of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolisms in the muscle of diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
