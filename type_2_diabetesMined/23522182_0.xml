<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study performed in Japan (NCT01152385) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients (n = 224) were randomized to AZD1656 (40-200, 20-140 or 10-80 mg titrated doses) or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary variable was the placebo-corrected change from baseline to 4 months in glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA1c ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Effects on fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and safety were also assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HbA1c was reduced numerically from baseline by 0.3-0.8% with AZD1656 and by 0.1% with placebo over the first 2 months of treatment, after which effects of AZD1656 started to decline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The changes from baseline to 4 months in HbA1c were not significant for the AZD1656 40-200 mg group vs. placebo (mean [95% CI] placebo-corrected change: -0.22 [-0.65, 0.20] %; p = 0.30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Formal significance testing was not carried out for the other two AZD1656 dose groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A higher percentage of patients on AZD1656 achieved HbA1c ≤7% after 4 months versus placebo, but responder rates were low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results for fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> reflected those for HbA1c  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> were rare with AZD1656 (one patient) and no safety concerns were raised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although initially favourable plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> reductions were observed, there was a loss of effect over time with sustained AZD1656 treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The study design did not allow an evaluation of the reasons for this lack of long-term efficacy </plain></SENT>
