<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Recent studies show the importance of controlling blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> variability in relationship to both reducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> and attenuating the risk for cardiovascular and behavioral complications due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is therefore important to design variability measures that are equally predictive of low and high blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excursions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We introduce the average daily risk range (ADRR), a variability measure computed from routine self-monitored blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (SMBG) data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ADRR was constructed using a development dataset for 39 and 31 adults with type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The formula was then fixed, and the ADRR was compared against other variability measures using an independent validation dataset containing approximately 4 months of SMBG for 254 and 81 adults with type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From the 1st month of validation SMBG data, we computed the ADRR, blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> SD and coefficient of variation, daily blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> range and interquartile range, mean amplitude of glycemic excursion, M-value, and lability index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Then <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> measures were tested as predictors of low blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (&lt;2.2 mmol/l; &lt;3.9 mmol/l) and high (&gt;10 mmol/l; &gt;22.2 mmol/l) events in the subsequent 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ADRR was the best predictor of both <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, with a 6-fold increase in the likelihood of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> and 3.5-fold increase in the likelihood of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> across its risk categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In a large SMBG database, the ADRR showed strong association with subsequent out-of-control <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> readings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with other variability measures, the ADRR demonstrated a superior balance of sensitivity to predicting both <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This prediction was independent from type of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
