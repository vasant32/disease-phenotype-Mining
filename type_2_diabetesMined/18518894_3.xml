<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of the current study were (i) to determine whether there was a relationship between glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (HgbA1c) and TG levels at the baseline visit and (ii) to analyse the relationship between DeltaHgbA1c and DeltaTG after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Among 650 consecutive diabetic patients seen in the Cleveland Clinic Preventive Cardiology Department, 372 had both baseline and post-treatment HgbA1c and TG values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We analysed the relationship between baseline HgbA1c and TG as well as between the change in HgbA1c and the change in TG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For analysis, patients were divided into nine groups by tertiles of HgbA1c (&lt; or =6.6, 6.7-7.8 and &gt;7.8%) and TG (&lt; or =1.75, 1.76-3.89 and &gt;3.89 mmol/l) at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, there was a small correlation between HgbA1c and TG (r(2) = 0.051; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For the entire group, there was a significant correlation between DeltaHgbA1c and DeltaTG from baseline to follow-up (r(2) = 0.077; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analyses by tertiles showed that DeltaTG were only associated with changes in two groups: HgbA1c tertile 3 (&gt;7.8%) and TG tertiles 2 (r(2) = 0.24; p &lt; 0.0001) and 3 (r(2) = 0.187; p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For every 1% change in the top tertile HgbA1c, there was a 9.3% change in TG (tertile 2) and a 9.8% change in TG (tertile 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggest that for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and elevated TG, the effect of HgbA1c reduction has limited effects on TG reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients may benefit from TG-specific therapy initiated earlier rather than waiting to see effects of glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
