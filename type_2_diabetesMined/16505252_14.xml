<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the structural gene located within a region on 1q21-q23 linked with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in several populations for variants in the Pima Indians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Functionally important segments of ATF6 were sequenced in 15 diabetic and 15 nondiabetic Pimas and representative single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) tested for association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in 900-1,000 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We identified 20 variants including three amino acid substitutions [Met(67)Val, Pro(145)Ala, and Ser(157)Pro] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pro(145)Ala and Ser(157)Pro were in a complete linkage disequilibrium and showed a nominal association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P = 0.05; odds ratio 2.3 [95% CI 1.0-5.2]) and with 30-min plasma insulin during oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test in 287 nondiabetic individuals (P = 0.045) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the associations with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and plasma insulin levels are marginal and their functional consequences are yet unknown, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three amino acid substitutions are located in a functionally important part of ATF6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because these variants are not unique to the Pimas, it will be feasible to investigate their association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in other populations to better evaluate their significance for a predisposition to the disease </plain></SENT>
