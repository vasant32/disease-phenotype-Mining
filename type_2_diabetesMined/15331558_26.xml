<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We determined the magnitude of familial aggregation in the development of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> (DN) among a population-based cohort of Finnish type 1 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Probands with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were identified from the nationwide register of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Finnish cases diagnosed during 1965-1979 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By 1998, there were 537 families with at least two siblings with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These 537 probands and their 616 diabetic siblings were followed for a diagnosis of DN until the end of 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We identified 323 cases of DN in these families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>If the proband had DN, 38% of the siblings also had DN, whereas out of the diabetic siblings of the probands without DN, only 17% had DN (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Diabetic siblings of the nephropathic probands had a 2.3 times (95% CI 1.4-2.7) higher risk of DN compared with siblings of probands free of DN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of a severe form of DN in the proband increases the risk threefold for diabetic siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sex, the DN of the proband, the age at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and parental type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were significant predictors of DN among diabetic siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although the majority of sibpairs with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are discordant for DN, its presence in one sibling doubles the risk for the other diabetic siblings </plain></SENT>
