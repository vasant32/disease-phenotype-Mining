<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The 10 year <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risks were estimated using the UK Prospective <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study (UKPDS) Risk Engine and the Framingham equation for 4,025 patients enrolled in the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">Lipids</z:chebi> in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study who had established type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> &lt;4.1 mmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean (SD) age of the patients was 60.7 (8.6) years, blood pressure 141/83 (17/10) mmHg and the total cholesterol:<z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> ratio was 3.9 (1.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median (interquartile range) <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration was 6 (3-11) years and the HbA(1c) level was 8.0% (7.2-9.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cohort comprised 65% men, 91% whites, 4% Afro-Caribbeans, 5% Asian Indians and 15% current smokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>More patients were classified as being at high risk by the UKPDS Risk Engine (65%) than by the Framingham <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> equation (63%) (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Framingham <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> equation classified fewer men and people aged &lt;50 years old as high risk (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no difference between the UKPDS Risk Engine and Framingham classification of women at high risk (p = 0.834) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These results suggest that the use of Framingham-derived rather than UKPDS Risk Engine-derived <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk estimates would deny about one in 25 patients <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> therapy when applying current NICE guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, under these guidelines the choice of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk calculator is important when assessing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, particularly for the identification of the relatively small proportion of younger people who require <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
