<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are association studies on genetic variation at CAPN10 in different human populations over a range of phenotypes related to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, physiological studies on the biological functions of calpain proteases, and evolutionary studies on CAPN10 and the NIDDM1 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We review here the studies published to date on CAPN10, as well as the latest findings from positional cloning studies on a number of other complex disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these studies provide perspective on the challenges of moving from the linkage mapping and positional cloning studies on which we have been focused to an understanding of the biology shaping the relationship of genotype to phenotype at loci influencing susceptibility to complex disorders like type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
