<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="3095">Biguanides</z:chebi> lower the blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> values without stimulation of insulin release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have investigated the short-term effect of buformin on insulin sensitivity, solved <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor receptors (sTNFRs), and serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> in overweight subjects with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Thirteen overweight subjects with type 2 DM were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The subjects who were fed 20 kcal/kg body weight were divided into two subgroups according to whether they were treated by buformin (Buformin group), or dietary therapy alone (Diet group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six patients were in Buformin group and seven patients were in Diet group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We calculated insulin-mediated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake by the liver and peripheral tissues using euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp combined with an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> load before and after buformin treatment or diet therapy for 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, total cholesterol (T-chol), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-chol), and sTNFR2 were significantly decreased, and hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake significantly increased from 32 +/- 7 to 42 +/- 7% (P &lt; 0.05) in Buformin group but did not changed significantly in Diet group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion rate thought to express insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissue, TNF-alpha, sTNFR1, fasting plasma insulin, C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, and NEFA levels did not change significantly in both the groups after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: Buformin improved insulin sensitivity in the liver and decreased T-chol, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-chol, and sTNFR2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of action for buformin likely involves inhibition of TNF-alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Buformin lowers <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> including serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> and will therefore, be useful in management of overweight type 2 DM patients </plain></SENT>
