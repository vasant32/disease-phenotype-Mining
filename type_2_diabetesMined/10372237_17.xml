<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the optimal diet for improving <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profiles in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during moderate energy restriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 35 free-living <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were assigned to one of three 1,600 kcal/day diets for 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diets were high carbohydrate (10% fat, 4% saturated), high monounsaturated fat (MUFA) (32% fat, 7% saturated), or high saturated fat (SFA) (32% fat, 17% saturated) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Diet composition did not affect the magnitude of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, with subjects losing an average of 6.6 +/- 0.9 kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Energy restriction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> resulted in reductions in fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (-14%), insulin (-27%), GHb (-14%), and systolic (-7%) and diastolic blood pressure (-10%) levels and the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> response area (-17%) independent of diet composition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diet composition did affect the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> was 10% and 17% lower with the high-carbohydrate and high-MUFA diets, respectively, whereas no change was observed with the high-SFA diet (P &lt; 0.001 for effect of diet) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> was transiently reduced on the high-carbohydrate diet at weeks 1, 4, and 8, whereas higher fat consumption maintained these levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The total cholesterol:<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> ratio, although significantly reduced on the high-MUFA diet (P &lt; 0.01), was not different from the other two diets after adjustment for baseline differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Energy restriction, independent of diet composition, improves glycemic control; however, reducing SFA intake by replacing SFA with carbohydrate or MUFA reduces <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> maximally during <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and to a greater degree than has been shown in weight-stable studies </plain></SENT>
