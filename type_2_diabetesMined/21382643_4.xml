<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Poor glycemic control may be reflected by both the failure of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-management by patients as well as inadequate intervention strategies by clinicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this systematic review is to summarize existing knowledge regarding various barriers of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> management from the perspectives of both patients and clinicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A search of PubMed, CINAHL, ERIC, and PsycINFO identified 1454 articles in English published between 1990 and 2009, addressing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, patient's barriers, clinician's barriers, and self-management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients' adherence, attitude, beliefs, and knowledge about <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may affect <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Culture and language capabilities influence the patient's health beliefs, attitudes, health literacy, thereby affecting <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other influential factors include the patient's financial resources, co-morbidities, and social support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinician's attitude, beliefs and knowledge about <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> also influence <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clinicians may further influence the patient's perception through effective communication skills and by having a well-integrated health care system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Identifying barriers to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> management is necessary to improve the quality of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care, including the improvement of metabolic control, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further research that considers these barriers is necessary for developing interventions for individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
