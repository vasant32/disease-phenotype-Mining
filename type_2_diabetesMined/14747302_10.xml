<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In a panel of large Caucasian pedigrees, we genotyped markers in eight chromosomal regions previously reported as supporting linkage with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously reported significant linkage on chromosome 20q (maximum logarithm of odds score [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MLS</z:e>] = 2.79) in this panel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present analysis, candidate regions on 1q, 2q, 3q, 5q, 9q, and 10q yielded little evidence for linkage; a region on 2p (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MLS</z:e> = 1.64, P = 0.01 at position 9.0 cM) gave suggestive evidence of linkage; and a region on 8p (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MLS</z:e> = 3.67, P = 2.8 x 10(-5), at position 7.6 cM) gave significant evidence of linkage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conditional analyses were performed for both 2p and 8p regions and the region reported on 20q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MLS</z:e> for 2p increased from 1.64 to 1.79 (empirical P = 0.142) when conditioned for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> on 20q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The case was similar for 8p, where the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MLS</z:e> increased from 3.67 to 4.51 (empirical P = 0.023) when conditioned on families without evidence of linkage at 20q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our data support a type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility locus on chromosome 8p that appears to be independent from other susceptibility loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although we were able to replicate linkage in our pedigrees on chromosome 2p, we did not find evidence of linkage for regions on 1q, 2q, 3q, 5q, 9q, or 10q </plain></SENT>
