<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Although <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> therapy reduces cardiovascular risk, its relationship with the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first study (West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study [WOSCOPS]) that evaluated this association reported a small protective effect but used nonstandardized criteria for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, results from subsequent hypothesis-testing trials have been inconsistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this meta-analysis is to evaluate the possible effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> therapy on incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A systematic literature search for randomized <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> trials that reported data on <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> through February 2009 was conducted using specific search terms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition to the hypothesis-generating data from WOSCOPS, hypothesis-testing data were available from the Heart Protection Study (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32413">HPS</z:chebi>), the Long-Term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischemic Disease (LIPID) Study, the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT), the Justification for the Use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">Statins</z:chebi> in Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38545">Rosuvastatin</z:chebi> (JUPITER), and the Controlled <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38545">Rosuvastatin</z:chebi> Multinational Study in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>Heart Failure</z:hpo> (CORONA), together including 57,593 patients with mean follow-up of 3.9 years during which 2,082 incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> cases accrued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Weighted averages were reported as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs using a random-effects model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Statistical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> scores were assessed with the Q and I(2) statistic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the meta-analysis of the hypothesis-testing trials, we observed a small increase in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk (RR 1.13 [95% CI 1.03-1.23]) with no evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> across trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, this estimate was attenuated and no longer significant when the hypothesis-generating trial WOSCOPS was included (1.06 [0.93-1.25]) and also resulted in significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> (Q 11.8 [5 d.f.], P = 0.03, I(2) = 57.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> therapy greatly lowers vascular risk, including among those with and at risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the relationship of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> therapy to incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> remains uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Future <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> trials should be designed to formally address this issue </plain></SENT>
