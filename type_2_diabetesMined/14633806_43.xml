<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its low levels are predictive of future development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because no studies on the regulatory role of adiponectin in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis in Asian Indians exist, this analysis was performed to determine the prospective association of adiponectin and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Baseline values of plasma adiponectin, results of anthropometry, fasting and 2-h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, HbA(1c), results of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> were analyzed in 91 subjects with IGT (53 men and 38 women) in a primary prevention study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reassessment of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance was performed during 1-year review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The predictive nature of adiponectin for development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was assessed using univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A control group comprising healthy, normoglycemic individuals was used for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At follow-up, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had developed in 25 of the 91 study subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean baseline adiponectin level was lower in the diabetic subjects than in the nondiabetic subjects (11.3 +/- 5.5 vs. 16.7 +/- 7.6 micro g/ml, P = 0.0017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Low adiponectin level was a strong predictor of future development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and HbA(1c) also showed a positive predictive association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Women had higher adiponectin levels (16.4 +/- 6.1 micro g/ml) than men (13.9 +/- 7.6 micro g/ml) (P = 0.035) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In Asian Indians, low plasma adiponectin level was predictive of future development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
