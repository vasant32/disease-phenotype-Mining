<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Exercise training improves insulin sensitivity, but its effects on beta-cell function are less well studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Sedentary, overweight adults were randomized to control or one of three 8-month exercise programs: 1) low amount/moderate intensity, 2) low amount/vigorous intensity, or 3) high amount/vigorous intensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 387 randomized, 260 completed the study and 237 had complete data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity (S(i)), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (AIRg), and the disposition index (DI = S(i) x AIRg) were modeled from an intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with control subjects, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three training programs led to increases in DI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the moderate-intensity group experienced a significantly larger increase in DI than either of the vigorous-intensity groups and through a different mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The high-amount/vigorous-intensity group improved S(i) and had a compensatory reduction in AIRg, whereas the moderate-intensity group had a similar improvement in S(i) but almost no reduction in AIRg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Importantly, the inactive control group experienced a significant increase in fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: To the extent that the DI accurately reflects beta-cell function, we observed that both moderate- and vigorous-intensity exercise training improved beta-cell function, albeit through distinct mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is not clear which of these mechanisms is preferable for maintenance of metabolic health </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>While moderate-intensity exercise led to a larger improvement in DI, which may reflect a transition toward a more <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> DI, longer-term investigations would be necessary to determine which was more effective at reducing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
