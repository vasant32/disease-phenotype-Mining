<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study using the 2001-2003 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, a national population-based, random sample telephone survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed access to health care, use of family planning, measurement and elevation of cholesterol, elevation of blood pressure, and respondents' perceptions of health and impairment among women aged 18-44 years with hGDM (n = 4,718) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariate models adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, BMI, presence of children in the household, and current smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Outcome measures were suboptimal across racial/ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Approximately one-fifth of the overall population reported no health insurance, cost barriers to physician visits, and no primary care provider </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One-quarter had no examination within the past year, and almost one-fifth reported no family planning and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020443" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated cholesterol</z:e> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Latinas were the most disadvantaged, with 40% reporting no health insurance and no primary care provider and one-fourth reporting suboptimal perceptions of health </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Asian/Pacific Islanders were the most advantaged in terms of health care access, cholesterol and blood pressure elevation, and impaired physical health </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Racial/ethnic differences in health care use and presence of risk factors were not entirely explained by health care access or other covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Significant racial/ethnic variation exists among women with hGDM for access to and use of health care, presence of risk factors, and perceptions of health </plain></SENT>
