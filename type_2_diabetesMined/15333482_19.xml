<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We examined the endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (eNOS) gene polymorphisms to assess its possible association with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> and macular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 226 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 186 healthy subjects were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Type 2 diabetic patients consisted of 110 patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, 46 patients with nonproliferative diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, and 71 patients with proliferative diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diabetic macular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> was present in 48 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three polymorphisms of the eNOS gene were determined: T-786C in the promoter region, 27-bp repeat in intron 4, and Glu298Asp in exon 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Close linkage disequilibrium was observed between the T-786C polymorphism and the 27-bp repeat, as has been previously reported, but Glu298Asp was not in linkage disequilibrium with the other two polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The eNOS gene polymorphisms were not significantly associated with the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> or with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> severity or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, by both association study and multiple logistic regression analysis, the T-786C and 27-bp repeat polymorphisms were significantly associated with a risk of developing macular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> with the -786C allele and the "a" allele increasing the risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that the eNOS gene is a novel genetic risk factor for diabetic macular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The eNOS gene polymorphisms may contribute to the development of macular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> by impairing basal eNOS expression and resulting in the breakdown of the blood-retina barrier </plain></SENT>
