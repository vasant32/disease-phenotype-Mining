<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a set of genes influencing oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is downregulated in diabetic muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we studied whether genetic, epigenetic and non-genetic factors influence a component of the respiratory chain, COX7A1, previously shown to be downregulated in skeletal muscle from patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The specific aims were to: (1) evaluate the impact of genetic (single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs]), epigenetic (DNA methylation) and non-genetic (age) factors on the expression of COX7A1 in human skeletal muscle; and (2) investigate whether common variants in the COX7A1 gene are associated with increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: COX7A1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was analysed in muscle biopsies from young (n = 110) and elderly (n = 86) non-diabetic twins and related to measures of in vivo metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genetic variants (three SNPs) from the COX7A1 locus were genotyped in the twins and in two independent type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> case-control cohorts (n = 1466 and 6380, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DNA methylation of the COX7A1 promoter was analysed in a subset of twins (ten young, ten elderly) using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulphite</z:chebi> sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: While DNA methylation of the COX7A1 promoter was increased in muscle from elderly compared with young twins (19.9 +/- 8.3% vs 1.8 +/- 2.7%; p = 0.035), the opposite was found for COX7A1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression (elderly 1.00 +/- 0.05 vs young 1.68 +/- 0.06; p = 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The heritability of COX7A1 expression was estimated to be 50% in young and 72% in elderly twins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One of the polymorphisms investigated, rs753420, influenced basal COX7A1 expression in muscle of young (p = 0.0001) but not of elderly twins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The transcript level of COX7A1 was associated with increased in vivo <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake and VO(2max) (p = 0.009 and p = 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We did not observe any genetic association between COX7A1 polymorphisms and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after correcting for multiple testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our results provide further evidence for age as a factor influencing DNA methylation and expression of OXPHOS genes, and thereby in vivo metabolism </plain></SENT>
