<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used data from a prospective cohort study in 38,094 Dutch men and women, aged 20-70 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dietary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18067">phylloquinone</z:chebi> and menaquinones intakes were assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> case patients were ascertained mainly via self-report and verified against medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During 10.3 years of follow-up, 918 incident cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate model adjusting for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk factors and dietary factors, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18067">phylloquinone</z:chebi> intake tended to be associated (P = 0.08) with a reduced risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.81 (95% CI 0.66-0.99) for the highest versus the lowest quartile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For menaquinones intake, a linear, inverse association (P = 0.038) with risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was observed with an HR of 0.93 (0.87-1.00) for each 10-microg increment in the multivariate model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18067">phylloquinone</z:chebi> and menaquinones intakes may be associated with a reduced risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
