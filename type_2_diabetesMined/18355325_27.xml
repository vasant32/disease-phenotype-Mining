<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comprising a 52-week core study with a 4-week, active treatment-free washout followed by a 52-week extension study with another washout period conducted in 131 drug-naïve patients with T2DM and mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> [glycosylated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA(1c)) 6.2-7.2%] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received lifestyle counselling at each study visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Efficacy and tolerability were assessed during visits at weeks 0 (core study baseline), 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40 and 52 of active treatment; at week 56 (i.e. after the first washout period); at weeks 68, 80, 96 and 108 and at week 112 (i.e. after the second washout period) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Standard meal tests were also performed at weeks 0, 24, 52, 56, 80, 108 and 112 to assess postprandial glycaemia and beta-cell function, which was quantified by <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> area under the curve (AUC(0-2) (h))/insulin secretory rate (ISR) AUC(0-2) (h) (ISR/G) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Changes from baseline and between-treatment differences (placebo-adjusted changes from baseline during vildagliptin treatment) were analysed by ancova </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The placebo-adjusted change from week 0 in HbA(1c) was -0.3 +/- 0.1% after 1 year of vildagliptin treatment (p &lt; 0.001) and -0.5 +/- 0.2% after 2 years (p = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The placebo-adjusted change from core study baseline in fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> AUC(0-2) (h) and in the beta-cell function parameter, ISR/G, tended to be greater after 2 years than after 1 year of treatment with vildagliptin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Even after a 4-week washout, the placebo-adjusted change from week 0 to week 112 in ISR/G was 3.2 +/- 1.6 pmol/min/m(2)/mM (p = 0.058) and the placebo-adjusted difference in the change from week 0 to week 112 in HbA(1c) was -0.3 +/- 0.1% (p = 0.051) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidences of adverse events (AEs), serious AEs and discontinuations because of AEs were similar in the two treatment groups, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0745153" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemic episodes</z:e> were reported by no patient receiving vildagliptin and by two patients receiving placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In drug-naïve patients with mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e>, 2-year treatment with vildagliptin 50 mg once daily attenuated the progressive loss of glycaemic control seen in patients receiving only lifestyle counselling (and placebo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This appears to be because of a corresponding attenuation of the deterioration of beta-cell function as assessed by ISR/G </plain></SENT>
