<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Saskatchewan Health databases were used to examine population-based mortality rates for new users of oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Individuals with prescriptions for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> in 1991-1996 and no use in the year prior were identified as new users </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prescription records were prospectively followed for 1-9 years; subjects with any insulin use were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were identified based on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9 codes in an electronic vital statistics database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression and survival analyses were used to assess the differences in mortality between drug cohorts, after adjusting for potential confounding variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The total study sample comprised 12,272 new users of oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> agents; the average length of follow-up was 5.1 (SD 2.2) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In subjects with at least 1 year of drug exposure and no insulin use, mortality rates were 750/3,033 (24.7%) for those receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> monotherapy, 159/1,150 (13.8%) for those receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy, and 635/4,683 (13.6%) for those receiving combination therapy over an average 5.1 (SD 2.2) years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The adjusted odds ratio (OR) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy was 0.60 (95% CI 0.49-0.74) compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">Sulfonylurea</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> combination therapy was also associated with reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.58-0.75) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Reduced cardiovascular-related mortality rates were also observed in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> users compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> monotherapy users </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> therapy, alone or in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi>, was associated with reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause and cardiovascular mortality compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> monotherapy among new users of these agents </plain></SENT>
