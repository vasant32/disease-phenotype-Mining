<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This review considers the epidemiologic evidence of an increasing incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in youth, the classification and diagnostic issues related to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in young populations, pathophysiologic mechanisms relevant to the increasing incidence, the role of genetics and environment, and the community challenge for prevention and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in youth has been recognized to be frequent in populations of native North Americans and to comprise some 30 percent of new cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the 2nd decade of life, largely accounted for by minority populations and associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among Japanese schoolchildren, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is seven times more common than type 1, and its incidence has increased more than 30-fold over the past 20 years, concomitant with changing food patterns and increasing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The forms of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> seen in children and youth include typical type 1, occurring in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> races; type 2, seen predominantly in minority youth; atypical <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, seen as an autosomal dominantly transmitted disorder in African-American populations; and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004904'>maturity-onset diabetes of the young</z:hpo> (MODY), seen rarely and only in Caucasians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the nonautoimmune forms of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> seen in youth, only type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is increasing in incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Proper classification requires consideration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>/severe versus insidious), ethnicity, family history, presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and if necessary, studies of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo> predicts the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Pima Indians, in offspring of parents with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and in other high-risk populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>African-American children and youth have greater insulin responses during <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance testing and during hyperglycemic clamp study than do whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There is also evidence of altered beta-cell function preceding the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of particular interest is the evidence that abnormal fetal and infantile nutrition is associated with the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The thrifty phenotype hypothesis states that poor nutrition in fetal and infant life is detrimental to the development and function of the beta-cells and insulin sensitive tissues, leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> under the stress of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The thrifty genotype hypothesis proposes that defective insulin action in utero results in decreased fetal growth as a conservation mechanism, but at the cost of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in later childhood or adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The vast majority of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in adults is polygenic and associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Monogenic forms (MODY, maternally transmitted <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> mutations) are rare, but are more likely to appear in childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Linkage studies of the common polygenic type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have emphasized the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of the disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The prevention and treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in children and youth is a daunting challenge because of the enormous behavioral influence, difficulty in reversing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and typical nonadherence in this age-group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The emerging epidemic of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the pediatric population, especially among minorities whose proportion in the U.S. population is increasing, presents a serious public health problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The full effect of this epidemic will be felt as these children become adults and develop the long-term complications of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
