<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SGLT-2 inhibitors are in clinical development for treatment of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mechanism may be of value also in the treatment of type 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T1DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study investigated effects of the SGLT-2 inhibitor, empagliflozin, alone and in combination with insulin, on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis in an animal model of T1DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were administered a single intraperitoneal injection of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> (STZ; 60 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Acutely, STZ rats received two doses of insulin glargine with or without empagliflozin, and blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a subchronic study, STZ rats received empagliflozin alone, one or two insulin-releasing implants or a combination of one implant and empagliflozin over 28 days; blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and HbA(1c) were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> setting, empagliflozin in combination with 1.5 IU insulin induced a similar <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering effect as 6 IU insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both interventions were more efficacious than monotherapy with 1.5 IU insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the subchronic study, 12-h blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> profile on day 28 in the combination group was lower than with one implant, and similar to two implants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Plasma HbA(1c) was improved in the combination group and in animals with two implants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Empagliflozin reduced blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels in a T1DM animal model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Empagliflozin combined with low-dose insulin showed comparable <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering efficacy to treatment with high-dose insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that empagliflozin is an efficacious adjunctive-to-insulin therapy with the clinical potential for the treatment of T1DM </plain></SENT>
