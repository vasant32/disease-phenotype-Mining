<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2D) and their first-degree relatives (FDRs) are characterized by hypoadiponectinaema and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In T2D patients, plasma adiponectin and insulin sensitivity (SI) increase in response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> (TZDs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest a role for adiponectin in the regulation of SI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied the relationship between plasma adiponectin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism and the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> (200 mg/day) for 12 weeks in 19 normoglycaemic, <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> FDR and 20 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> T2D patients, using euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamps, glycolytic flux calculations and indirect calorimetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma adiponectin was similar in both groups, despite higher <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal (Rd), <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> oxidation and glycolytic flux and lower <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> oxidation during insulin stimulation in FDR compared with T2D patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma adiponectin correlated with insulin-stimulated Rd, non-oxidative <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal (NOGD), <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> storage and SI in both groups after adjustment for sex and body fat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi>-mediated upregulation of plasma adiponectin was associated with increased insulin-stimulated Rd, NOGD and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> storage in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No effect on endogenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In FDR, plasma adiponectin correlated with insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase activity and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi>-induced increase in plasma adiponectin correlated with the improvement in insulin-stimulated Rd and SI after adjustment for sex and body fat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, plasma adiponectin in weight-matched FDR and T2D patients is comparably low and correlates with insulin-mediated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake and storage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, these data provide evidence for an adiponectin-dependent insulin-sensitizing effect of TZDs at an early stage before development of T2D and that this effect is exerted mainly on insulin-mediated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
