<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> is an increasingly recognized entity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathogenic factors that may contribute to its development, especially the earliest changes of diastolic dysfunction (DD), have not been clearly defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Microvessel dysfunction and upregulation of profibrotic growth factors have been described as possible causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was therefore to determine whether microvascular dysfunction and/or upregulation of the profibrotic connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) are associated with subclinical DD in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 20 age-matched non-diabetic controls, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom had no clinical evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischaemic heart disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> or echo evidence of systolic ventricular dysfunction, were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Microvascular function was measured by laser Doppler velocimetry, with examination of endothelium-dependent increase in blood flow following iontophoresis of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi>) and endothelium-independent increase in blood flow in response to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50566">nitric oxide donor</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi> (SNP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CTGF levels were determined by Western immunoblotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: DD determined on the basis of traditional echocardiographic criteria was similar in diabetic subjects compared with controls (28 vs. 20%, p = 0.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using left ventricular myocardial tissue Doppler-based indices for DD, the E/E' and the E'/A' ratios (where E is the flow related to early ventricular filling and E' and A' are early and late diastolic velocities, respectively) in diabetic subjects revealed evidence of more DD than controls (p = 0.046 and p = 0.007 respectively)  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Comparing controls with no DD by conventional echocardiographic criteria (Group I), <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and no DD (Group II) and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with DD (Group III), there was a significant trend in reduction of both endothelium-dependent (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> fold change; p = 0.04) and endothelium-independent (SNP fold change; p = 0.0004) blood flow across the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> and SNP responses, however, were not correlated significantly with quartiles of the E/E' ratio or the E'/A' ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CTGF plasma levels did not differ across the groups and CTGF did not correlate with parameters of microvascular function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that while there is a significant association between DD and measures of microvascular function, the relationship between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e>, CTGF and subtle measures of DD is not strong </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Other factors are therefore likely to play an important role in the early pathogenesis of subclinical cardiac DD in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
