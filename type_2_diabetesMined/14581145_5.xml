<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> disorder characterized by defects in the early phase of insulin secretion after meals and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> at its early stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A new insulin secretagogue, nateglinide, has been shown to elicit an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin release and to reduce <z:hpo ids='HP_0011998'>postprandial hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have treated 30 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> using nateglinide and performed a standard meal test at breakfast, both before and after the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo> and beta-cell function was assessed by the HOMA model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nateglinide, at 1 and 2 h after the test meal, significantly stimulated postprandial insulin secretion by 62.0 and 41.0% and improved blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> values by 17.3 and 21.9%, respectively, after the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FBG) and glycohemoglobin was significantly reduced by 9.8 and 10.3%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The reduction was significantly larger in postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> than in FBG (P&lt;0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significant correlation was found in the HOMA-insulin resistant (IR) index and in the changes of fasting IRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When the patients were divided into three groups, forming a markedly insulin resistant (MIR) group, an IR group and a non-insulin resistant (NIR) group, HOMA-IR levels improved significantly, from 7.0 +/- 4.3 to 4.5 +/- 2.8 (P=0.026) in the MIR group and showed a tendency toward improvement in the IR group, from 2.9 +/- 0.7 to 2.3 +/- 1.1 (P=0.062), but failed to exhibit such a positive response in the NIR group, changing from 1.2 +/- 0.2 to 1.9 +/- 0.9 (P=0.21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>HOMA-beta, on the other hand, improved significantly in the NIR group only, from 16.4 +/- 7.8 to 26.9 +/- 9.9 (P=0.017), but not in the IR nor MIR groups (M +/- S.D.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, nateglinide improved the excessive excursion of postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> by the augmentation of early insulin secretion after a meal and differentially affected fasting insulin levels and HOMA-IR indexes, depending on the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
