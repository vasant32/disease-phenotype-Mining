<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Liraglutide, a once-daily glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, is approved for use as monotherapy in the USA and Japan (but not in Europe or Canada) and in combination with selected oral agents (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> regions) for the treatment of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Guidance from local advisory bodies is emerging on the most appropriate place for liraglutide in the treatment pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is apparent from its phase 3 clinical trial programme that liraglutide provides superior glycaemic control compared with that achieved with other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> agents used early in the treatment pathway (e.g. <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Key additional benefits include a low incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> and clinically relevant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, although these benefits may be ameliorated by concomitant sulphonylurea (SU) treatment and, in the case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e>, reduction of the SU dose may be necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall, the profile of liraglutide is similar and, in some aspects, superior to twice-daily exenatide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The implementation of liraglutide therapy is straightforward, with simple dose titration from the starting dose of 0.6 to 1.2 mg/day after 1 week; some patients may benefit from additional titration to 1.8 mg/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment is self-administered by subcutaneous injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This contrasts with other agents used early in the treatment pathway, but clinical data suggest patients' overall treatment satisfaction with liraglutide is similar (1.2 mg) or better (1.8 mg) than that with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> despite differing administration methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Some patients may experience <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> when initiating liraglutide treatment, but the titration regimen is designed to improve tolerability and clinical data indicate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> is transient </plain></SENT>
