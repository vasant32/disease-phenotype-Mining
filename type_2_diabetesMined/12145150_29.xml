<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast, a dissociation of insulin effect on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and amino acid metabolism has been reported in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Type 2 diabetic patients are reported to have reduced muscle oxidative enzymes and VO(2max) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effect of 11 days of intensive insulin treatment (T(2)D+) on whole-body amino acid kinetics, muscle protein synthesis rates, and muscle functions in eight type 2 diabetic subjects after withdrawing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treatments for 2 weeks (T(2)D-) and compared the results with those of weight-matched lean control subjects using stable isotopes of the amino acids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Whole-body leucine, phenylalanine and tyrosine fluxes, leucine oxidation, and plasma amino acid levels were similar in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups, although plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were significantly higher in T(2)D- </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Insulin treatment reduced leucine nitrogen flux and transamination rates in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Synthesis rates of muscle <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo>, sarcoplasmic, and mixed muscle proteins were not affected by glycemic status or insulin treatment in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Muscle strength was also unaffected by <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or glycemic status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the diabetic patients showed increased tendency for <z:mp ids='MP_0003646'>muscle fatigability</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Insulin treatment also failed to stimulate muscle <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4056">cytochrome</z:chebi> C oxidase activity in the diabetic patients, although it modestly elevated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50744">citrate</z:chebi> synthase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, improvement of glycemic status by insulin treatment did not alter whole-body amino acid turnover in type 2 diabetic subjects, but leucine nitrogen flux, transamination rates, and plasma ketoisocaproate level were decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Insulin treatments in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had no effect on muscle <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> protein synthesis and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4056">cytochrome</z:chebi> C oxidase, a key enzyme for ATP production </plain></SENT>
