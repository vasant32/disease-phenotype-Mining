<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Local <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> of white adipose tissue induces cytokine-mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> of adipocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This results in <z:mp ids='MP_0008034'>enhanced lipolysis</z:mp> within these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The fatty acids that are released into the cytosol can be removed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> beta-oxidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The flux through this pathway is normally limited by the rate of <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> supply, which in turn is determined by the metabolic activity of the adipocyte </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is expected that the latter does not adapt to an increased rate of lipolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We propose that elevated fatty acid concentrations in the cytosol of adipocytes induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> uncoupling and thereby allow mitochondria to remove much larger amounts of fatty acids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By this, release of fatty acids out of adipocytes into the circulation is prevented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When the rate of fatty acid release into the cytosol exceeds the beta-oxidation capacity, cytosolic fatty acid concentrations increase and induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This results in a decrease in beta-oxidation capacity and the entry of fatty acids into the circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Unless these released fatty acids are removed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> oxidation in active muscles, these fatty acids result in ectopic triacylglycerol deposits, induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, beta cell damage and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">Thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> improve <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> function within adipocytes and may in this way alleviate the burden imposed by the excessive fat accumulation associated with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, the number and activity of mitochondria within adipocytes contribute to the threshold at which fatty acids are released into the circulation, leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
