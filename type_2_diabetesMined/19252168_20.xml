<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the detailed associations of these complex relationships remain elusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the prospective associations between self-reported TV viewing time, objectively measured time spent sedentary, at light-intensity activity, and at moderate- and vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In 192 individuals (81 men and 111 women) with a family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we measured physical activity and anthropometric and metabolic variables at baseline and after 1 year of follow-up in the ProActive UK trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Physical activity was measured objectively by accelerometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo> was expressed as fasting insulin and the homeostasis model assessment score (HOMA-IR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Baseline MVPA was a significant predictor of fasting insulin at follow-up (beta = -0.004 [95% CI -0.007 to -0.0001], P = 0.022), and the association approached significance for HOMA-IR (beta = -0.003 [-0.007 to 0.000002], P = 0.052), independent of time spent sedentary, at light-intensity activity, sex, age, smoking status, waist circumference, and self-reported TV viewing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Time spent sedentary and at light-intensity activity were not significantly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The change in MVPA between baseline and follow-up was inversely related to fasting insulin (beta = -0.003 [-0.007 to -0.0003], P = 0.032) and the HOMA-IR score (beta = -0.004 [-0.008 to -0.001], P = 0.015) at follow-up, after adjustment for baseline phenotype in addition to the same confounders as above </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight the importance of promoting moderate-intensity activity such as brisk walking for improving insulin sensitivity and possibly other metabolic risk factors to prevent type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
