<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Asymmetric <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17929">NG,NG-dimethylarginine</z:chebi> (ADMA), an endogenous inhibitor of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase, is regulated by the enzymatic participants of synthetic and metabolic processes, i.e., type I protein N-arginine methyltransferase (PRMT) and dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous reports have demonstrated that circulating ADMA levels can vary in patients with type 1 and type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>White adipose tissue expresses the full enzymatic machinery necessary for ADMA production and metabolism; however, modulation of the activities of adipose ADMA-related enzymes in T2DM remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519106" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">rodent model</z:e> of T2DM using 11- and 20-week old Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression and catalytic activity of PRMT1 and DDAH1 and 2 in the white adipose tissues (periepididymal, visceral and subcutaneous fats) and femur skeletal muscle tissue were determined by immunoblotting, in vitro methyltransferase and in vitro <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18211">citrulline</z:chebi> assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> diabetic GK rats showed low expression and activity of adipose PRMT1 compared to age-matched Wistar controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adipose tissues from the periepididymal, visceral and subcutaneous fats of GK rats had high DDAH1 expression and total DDAH activity, whereas the DDAH2 expression was lowered below the control value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This dynamic of ADMA-related enzymes in white adipose tissues was distinct from that of skeletal muscle tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>GK rats had lower levels of serum non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (TG) than the control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects the adipose PRMT1 and DDAH activities were statistically correlated with the levels of serum NEFA and TG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Activities of PRMT1 and DDAH in white adipose tissues were altered in diabetic GK rats in an organ-specific manner, which was reflected in the serum levels of NEFA and TG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Changes in adipose ADMA-related enzymes might play a part in the function of white adipose tissue </plain></SENT>
