<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Eight patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (BMI 32.7 +/- 1.3 kg/m(2) and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> 13.5 +/- 1.2 mmol/l) underwent four different treatment regimens in random order: saline therapy, monotherapy with continuous subcutaneous infusion of GLP-1 (4.8 pmol x kg(-1) x min(-1)), monotherapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (30-mg tablet of Actos), and combination therapy with GLP-1 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The observation period was 48 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>End points were plasma levels of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, glucagon, free fatty acids (FFAs), and sensation of appetite </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> decreased from 13.5 +/- 1.2 mmol/l (saline) to 11.7 +/- 1.2 (GLP-1) and 11.5 +/- 1.2 (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>) and further decreased to 9.9 +/- 1.0 (combination) (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight-hour mean plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were reduced from 13.7 +/- 1.1 mmol/l (saline) to 10.6 +/- 1.0 (GLP-1) and 12.0 +/- 1.2 (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>) and were further reduced to 9.5 +/- 0.8 (combination) (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Insulin levels increased during monotherapy with GLP-1 compared with monotherapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Glucagon levels were reduced in GLP-1 and combination therapy compared with saline and monotherapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FFAs during breakfast (area under the curve, 0-3 h) were reduced in combination therapy compared with saline (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sensation of appetite was reduced during monotherapy with GLP-1 and combination therapy (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: GLP-1 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> show an additive <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A combination of the two agents may, therefore, be a valuable therapeutic approach for the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
