<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This double-blind randomized placebo-controlled parallel group study assessed the efficacy and safety (with particular regard to body weight and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>) of repaglinide when used in a flexible mealtime dosing regimen in a situation close to everyday clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 408 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> considered poorly controlled by diet, but without a history of previous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> medication, were randomized to receive 0.5 mg repaglinide at mealtimes (increased to 1 mg after 4 weeks depending on blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> response) or placebo for 16 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were free to choose a flexible meal pattern, adjusting the dosing schedule from two to four preprandial doses per day in accordance with a "one meal, one dose; no meal, no dose" principle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additional snacks were not a requirement of the treatment schedule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treatment with repaglinide significantly improved glycemic control with respect to baseline and placebo, reducing HbA1c by 1.14% from baseline and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> by 1.8 mmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Improvement in glycemic control was independent of the meal pattern adopted by patients, including those most commonly taking two or four meals daily, with no correlation between meal pattern and risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The improvement in glycemic control was also independent of degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and age &lt; or =65 or &gt;65 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant body weight increase in the repaglinide group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Mealtime dosing with repaglinide is effective in improving overall glycemic control in type 2 diabetic patients for which control is suboptimal using diet alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients are able to vary their meal pattern from a conventional regimen of three meals daily without compromising control or increasing the risk of adverse events </plain></SENT>
