<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo> is associated with decreased plasma LPL mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effects of insulin sensitisation on tissue-specific LPL expression and transport in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Arterio-venous gradients of plasma LPL activity and mass across adipose tissue and skeletal muscle were measured in 16 type 2 diabetic patients in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over randomised trial of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vivo LPL rate of action was assessed by tissue-specific arterio-venous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> concentration gradients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LPL <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was quantified in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Adipose tissue released large quantities of inactive LPL (p&lt;0.001); skeletal muscle released small amounts of active LPL (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">Rosiglitazone</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0009126'>increased adipose tissue</z:hpo> release of LPL mass (+35%, p=0.04) and decreased the release of active LPL from skeletal muscle (-57%, p=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">Rosiglitazone</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0009126'>increased adipose tissue</z:hpo> and skeletal muscle LPL <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, but did not affect adipose tissue LPL rate of action or activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Adipose tissue release of LPL mass correlated with systemic LPL mass concentrations (r=0.47, p=0.007), suggesting that the rate of adipose tissue release of LPL mass is a major determinant of systemic LPL mass concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: LPL transport from adipose tissue and skeletal muscle are regulated differently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In adipose tissue, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> increases LPL <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> abundance and LPL transport rate and possibly increases endothelial binding sites for LPL, but affects neither tissue LPL activity nor LPL rate of action </plain></SENT>
