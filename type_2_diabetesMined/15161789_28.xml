<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Ninety-three women assigned to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> had intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests at randomization and after 3 months of treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi>, 400 mg/day, and were genotyped for the Pro12Ala variant of the PPAR-gamma gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects were divided into tertiles based on their change in minimal model insulin sensitivity (S(i)) during the first 3 months of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean changes in S(i) in the bottom, middle, and top tertiles of S(i) response were -0.21 +/- 0.57, 0.91 +/- 0.26, and 2.58 +/- 1.32 min(-1) per microU/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>10(-4), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Frequencies of the Ala/- genotype were 30, 22, and 26% in the same three tertiles (P = 0.77) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of phenotypes by genotype revealed only small differences between the Pro/Pro and Ala/- groups, respectively, in baseline S(i) (2.76 +/- 0.19 vs. 2.33 +/- 0.33 x 10(-4) min(-1) per microU/ml; P = 0.27), the change in S(i) after 3 months of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> treatment (1.19 +/- 0.17 vs. 0.93 +/- 0.30; P = 0.46), and the cumulative incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during a median follow-up of 30 months (13 vs. 17%; P = 0.66) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among young Hispanic women at high risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the Pro12Ala variant of the PPAR-gamma receptor gene did not explain the failure of approximately 1/3 of subjects to increase their insulin sensitivity when placed on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> at a dose of 400 mg/day </plain></SENT>
