<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>FOXC2 is a winged helix gene that has been shown to counteract <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002155'>hypertriglyceridemia</z:hpo>, and diet-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in rodents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, FOXC2 was analyzed as a candidate gene for susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Pima Indians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four variants were identified by sequencing the coding region, as well as 638 bp of the 5' region and 300 bp of the 3' region of the gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were found in the putative promoter region, a C-512T transition and a G-350T </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, two SNPs were found in the 3' region, a C1548T and a C1702T </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The G-350T and the C1702T variants were in complete linkage disequilibrium, and the C1548T variant was relatively rare; therefore, only the C-512T and G-350T variants were additionally genotyped in 937 full-blooded Pima Indians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neither of these polymorphisms were associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; however, the C-512T variant was associated with BMI (P = 0.03) and percentage of body fat (P = 0.02) in male and female Pima subjects, as well as with basal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> turnover and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that variation in FOXC2 may have a minor role in body weight control and seems to be involved in the regulation of basal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> turnover and plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels in women, but this gene does not significantly contribute to the etiology of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Pima Indians </plain></SENT>
