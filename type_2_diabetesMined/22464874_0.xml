<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SMBG presents information about current glycemic status and provides the ability to obtain immediate feedback regarding the impact of behavioral and pharmacological interventions on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, SMBG is useful only when the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> information is understood correctly, data are accurately interpreted, and results prompt appropriate therapeutic actions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The International <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Federation (IDF) recently published guidelines for SMBG use in non-insulin treated people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, recommending that SMBG should be used only when patients and/or their clinicians possess the ability and willingness to incorporate SMBG monitoring and therapy adjustment into their <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care plan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>If SMBG is used, the IDF also recommends that structured SMBG be performed utilizing defined regimens to meet individual needs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Structured SMBG can be performed as daily <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> profiles that are representative of daily <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excursions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Measuring preprandial/postprandial blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (bG) levels on consecutive or alternating days ("testing in pairs") also provides impactful <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> information for daily <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This article reviews recent studies that appropriately utilized structured SMBG as an integral component of comprehensive <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> management and discusses how their findings support the IDF recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our goal is to help clinicians make more informed decisions about the value and utility of SMBG in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> management </plain></SENT>
