<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: In type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, therapies to maintain blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control usually fail after several years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We estimated the glycemic burden that accumulates from treatment failure and describe the time course and predictors of failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A prospective, population-based study using retrospective observational data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 7208 complete courses of treatment with nondrug therapy, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> monotherapy, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy, and combination oral antihyperglycemic therapy between 1994 and 2002, inclusive, among members of the Kaiser Permanente Northwest Region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We calculated mean cumulative glycemic burden, defined as HbA(1c)-months &gt;8.0 or 7.0% for each treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We then measured the likelihood that the next HbA(1c) would exceed 8.0 and 7.0% after HbA(1c) exceeded each of ten hypothetical treatment thresholds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, we estimated multivariate logistic regression models to predict when HbA(1c) would continue to deteriorate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In this well-controlled population, the average patient accumulated nearly 5 HbA(1c)-years of excess glycemic burden &gt;8.0% from diagnosis until starting insulin and about 10 HbA(1c)-years of burden &gt;7.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Whenever patients crossed the American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association-recommended treatment threshold of 8.0%, their next HbA(1c) result was as likely to be &lt;8.0 as &gt;8.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate prediction models had highly statistically significant coefficients, but predicted &lt;10% of the variation in future HbA(1c) results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should change <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering treatments in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> much sooner or use treatments that are less likely to fail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>An action point at 7.0% or lower is more likely to prevent additional deterioration than the traditional action point of 8.0% </plain></SENT>
