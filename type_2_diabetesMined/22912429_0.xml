<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the longitudinal effects of medication nonadherence (MNA) on key costs and estimate potential savings from increased adherence using a novel methodology that accounts for shared correlation among cost categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Veterans with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (740,195) were followed from January 2002 until <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, loss to follow-up, or December 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A novel multivariate, generalized, linear, mixed modeling approach was used to assess the differential effect of MNA, defined as medication possession ratio (MPR) ≥0.8 on healthcare costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A sensitivity analysis was performed to assess potential cost savings at different MNA levels using the Consumer Price Index to adjust estimates to 2012 dollar value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean MPR for the full sample over 5 years was 0.78, with a mean of 0.93 for the adherent group and 0.58 for the MNA group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In fully adjusted models, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> annual cost categories increased ∼3% per year (P = 0.001) during the 5-year study time period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MNA was associated with a 37% lower pharmacy cost, 7% lower outpatient cost, and 41% higher inpatient cost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on sensitivity analyses, improving adherence in the MNA group would result in annual estimated cost savings ranging from ∼$661 million (MPR &lt;0.6 vs. ≥0.6) to ∼$1.16 billion (MPR &lt;1 vs. 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Maximal incremental annual savings would occur by raising MPR from &lt;0.8 to ≥0.8 ($204,530,778) among MNA subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Aggressive strategies and policies are needed to achieve optimal medication adherence in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Such approaches may further the so-called "triple aim" of achieving better health, better quality care, and lower cost </plain></SENT>
