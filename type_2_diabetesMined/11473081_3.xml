<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35554">cardiovascular drug</z:chebi> use and hospitalizations attributable to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from 1 year before until 6 years after the start of oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this cohort study, 2,584 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were selected from the PHARMO Record Linkage System, comprising pharmacy records and hospitalizations for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 320,000 residents of six Dutch cities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were identified as incident oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drug users between 1992 and 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nondiabetic subjects were 1:1-matched for age, sex, pharmacy, and index date and received no insulin, oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs, or <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-testing supplies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were more likely to use <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35554">cardiovascular drugs</z:chebi> (RR 1.28 [95% CI 1.23-1.34]) and to be hospitalized because of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> (1.54 [1.33-1.78]) after the start of oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> therapy than nondiabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Differences between patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and nondiabetic subjects lessened from 1 year before until 6 years after the start of oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> therapy, reflected by decreasing attributable risks for <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretics</z:chebi>, beta-blockers, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38215">calcium channel blockers</z:chebi>, and cardiac and antithrombotic drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The difference in use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35457">angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering drugs increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular hospitalizations attributable to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were approximately 50% in the years close to the start of oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> treatment and decreased to approximately 33% in the following years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35554">cardiovascular drug</z:chebi> use and hospitalizations remained increased in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after the start of oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> therapy, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35554">cardiovascular drug</z:chebi> use attributable to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> decreased after the start of oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> therapy, especially beta-blockers, whereas cardiovascular hospitalizations first decreased and then stabilized </plain></SENT>
