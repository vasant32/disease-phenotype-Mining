<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine the relationship of skeletal muscle PTP1B to whole-body insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied 17 African Americans with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) and 16 without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PTP1B gene expression and protein abundance were determined in the biopsied skeletal muscles at the baseline of a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PTP1B gene expression was significantly higher in subjects with T2DM versus control (P &lt; 0.0001) and remained significantly different after adjusting for age and insulin sensitivity (P = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PTP1B gene expression was positively related to protein abundance (r(s) = 0.39; P = 0.03; adjusted for age and insulin sensitivity) and negatively related to insulin sensitivity (r(s) = -0.52; P = 0.002; adjusted for age) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overexpression and interference <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> of PTP1B were performed in primary human skeletal muscle culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PTP1B overexpression resulted in reduction of Akt phosphorylation in the control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, interference <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> transfection downregulated PTP1B expression and enhanced Akt phosphorylation in subjects with T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data show that skeletal muscle PTP1B gene expression is increased in African American subjects with T2DM, is negatively associated with whole-body insulin sensitivity, and contributes to modulation of insulin signaling </plain></SENT>
