<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighty-four participants were randomly assigned to either a control group or one of three experimental conditions: motivational intervention (PMT), volitional intervention (APCP), or combined motivational and volitional intervention (PMT&amp;APCP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PMT variables, dietary and exercise behaviours were measured at three time-points over a four-week period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The motivational intervention significantly changed PMT variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The combined motivational and volitional intervention significantly decreased fat intake and increased the frequency of exercise relative to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other groups, and significantly increased the amount of fruit and vegetables consumed relative to control and volitional intervention groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that motivational intervention is effective at changing cognitions but changing behaviour requires an intervention based on both motivation and volition </plain></SENT>
