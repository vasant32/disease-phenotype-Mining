<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Restricted to non-diabetic participants, we now investigate the relationship between POPs and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e>, a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetic state</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional associations were investigated in 721 non-diabetic participants aged &gt; or =20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nineteen POPs in five subclasses were selected because they were detectable in &gt; or =60% of participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among five POPs subclasses, organochlorine (OC) pesticides were most strongly and consistently associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e>: adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of 1.0, 1.5, 2.3 and 5.3 across OC <z:chebi fb="239" ids="25944">pesticide</z:chebi> quartiles (p for trend &lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="44" ids="28119">Dioxin</z:chebi>-like polychlorinated <z:chebi fb="21" ids="22888">biphenyls</z:chebi> (PCBs) were also positively associated with adjusted ORs of 1.0, 1.1, 2.2 and 2.1 (p for trend = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, non-<z:chebi fb="44" ids="28119">dioxin</z:chebi>-like PCBs showed an inverted U-shaped association with adjusted ORs of 1.0, 1.3, 1.8 and 1.0 (p for quadratic term &lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Associations of specific POPs varied across five components of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>OC pesticides were positively and significantly associated with four of the five components, especially elevated triacylglycerol and high fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, but not <z:mp ids='MP_0002842'>high blood pressure</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PCBs were significantly associated with waist circumference, triacylglycerol and impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="23825">dioxins</z:chebi> and polychlorinated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28145">dibenzofurans</z:chebi> showed small but significant associations only with <z:mp ids='MP_0002842'>high blood pressure</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: This study suggests that the prevalence of a cluster of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> relates to background exposure to a mixture of POPs, several of which are also related to the prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>POPs associated differentially with different components of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
