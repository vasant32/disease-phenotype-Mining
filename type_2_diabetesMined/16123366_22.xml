<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we evaluated changes in gene expression that accompany <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta-cell dysfunction</z:hpo> in the db/db mouse model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In db/db islets, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of many genes implicated in beta-cell <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> sensing were progressively reduced with time, as were several transcription factors important for the maintenance of beta-cell differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conversely, genes normally suppressed in beta-cells, such as a variety of stress response mediators and inhibitor of differentiation/DNA binding 1, a gene capable of inhibiting differentiation, were markedly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We assessed whether this global alteration in the pattern of beta-cell gene expression was related more to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>; db/db mice were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8113">phlorizin</z:chebi>, which selectively lowered plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47612">bezafibrate</z:chebi>, which selectively lowered plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>GIIS as well as the majority of the changes in gene expression were completely normalized by lowering <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> but were unaffected by lowering <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the restoration of GIIS was not accompanied by normalized uncoupling protein 2 or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels, which were upregulated in db/db islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These studies demonstrate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, independent of plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels, is sufficient for the loss of beta-cell differentiation and secretory function in db/db mice </plain></SENT>
