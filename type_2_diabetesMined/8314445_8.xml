<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of potential glucokinase defects contributing to susceptibility to Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> in Welsh Caucasians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For this analysis, two microsatellite repeat polymorphisms flanking opposite ends of the gene were employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For a recently described microsatellite (GCK2), located 6 kilobases upstream of islet exon 1, six different sized alleles were observed, with heterozygosity of 0.50 and polymorphism information content 0.44 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Combined heterozygosity with another microsatellite repeat (GCK1) was 0.72 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant linkage disequilibrium was noted between GCK2 and GCK1, suggesting that haplotypes may be a better predictor of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than analysis with either microsatellite alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using these two markers, the association with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of alleles and genotypes at GCK1 did not differ between the patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 157) and control subjects (n = 73) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similarly no differences were observed in GCK2 alleles or genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of haplotypes, derived from the two markers, also did not differ between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>To investigate the possibility of minor metabolic effects of glucokinase defects, we also studied the association between the GCK alleles or haplotypes and the response profiles to meal tolerance tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No association was observed between plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> or insulin responses to meal tolerance tests with GCK haplotypes or alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that glucokinase mutations in Welsh Caucasians are not major determinants of susceptibility to the common type of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
