<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between depressive symptoms and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-specific distress and the independent relationships of each of these factors with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We expected that symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> would be associated with poorer <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-care, independent of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-specific distress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We surveyed 848 primary care patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> using the Harvard Department of Psychiatry/National <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Screening Day Scale (HANDS), Problem Areas in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> scale (PAID), Summary of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Self-Care Activities, and self-reported medication adherence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The PAID and HANDS scores were positively correlated in the overall sample (r=0.54, p&lt;0.0001), among those who did not meet diagnostic criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1269683" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="MDD">major depressive disorder</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDD</z:e>) based on the HANDS screening result (n=685; r=0.36, p&lt;0.001) and in patients who did meet the screening criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDD</z:e> (n=163; r=0.36, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Higher PAID scores significantly predicted lower levels of diet, exercise and medication adherence (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p values &lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, once <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> symptom scores were entered into these models, most relationships were reduced to non-significance, while the HANDS score retained significant relationships with most indices of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The same pattern of results was found in the subset of patients who did not screen positive for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These results suggest that specific symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> have a greater negative relationship with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-care than <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-specific distress, even among those patients who do not meet screening criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interventions that focus on improving the management of specific symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> may be more effective in improving self-care than those that focus on reducing distress </plain></SENT>
