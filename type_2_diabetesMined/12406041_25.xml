<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a multicentre, randomized, placebo-controlled study with a 4-week placebo plus diet lead-in period and a 48-week, double-blind treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Overweight or <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> adults [body mass index (BMI) &gt;or= 28 kg/m2] with HbA1c of 6.5-11% and clinical type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were randomized to orlistat (120 mg t.i.d. n = 189) or placebo (n = 180) in conjunction with a low-calorie diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients had either received sulphonylurea therapy for at least 2 months before the study or were not receiving any <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> medication (the majority of which were drug-na√Øve) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 1 year, patients in the orlistat group lost significantly more weight than patients in the placebo group (-5.4% vs. -3.6%; p = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, significantly more patients achieved <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> of &gt;or= 5% with orlistat compared with placebo (51.3% vs. 31.6%; p = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients treated with orlistat also had significantly greater improvements than placebo-treated patients in HbA1c (-0.9% vs. -0.4%; p &lt; 0.001), fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (-1.6 vs.-0.7 mmol/l; p = 0.004) and post-prandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (-1.8 vs. -0.5 mmol/l; p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, orlistat-treated patients had a significantly greater reduction in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> compared with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, orlistat had a similar safety profile to placebo, with the exception of a higher incidence of generally mild and transient gastrointestinal events known to be associated with the mode of action of orlistat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with orlistat plus diet resulted in significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, improved glycaemic control and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factor</z:e> profile in overweight patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
