<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Physical activity improves features of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> but many patients find it difficult to exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To determine whether use of an electrical muscle stimulator mimics exercise in neurologically intact individuals and has metabolic benefits in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> changes in pulse, blood pressure and energy expenditure were measured in 33 healthy volunteers using the muscle stimulator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> changes in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake were measured in five subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Body composition, features of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> and measures of insulin sensitivity were measured before and after 12 weeks daily use of the stimulator in four subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The muscle stimulator acutely increased pulse, blood pressure, energy expenditure and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Daily use over 12 weeks improved insulin stimulated nonesterified fatty acid suppression but did not result in changes in body composition or clinical parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although the muscle stimulator acutely mimics exercise, limitations in the size of the stimulating current mean that the magnitude of these changes is too small to produce clinical benefit </plain></SENT>
