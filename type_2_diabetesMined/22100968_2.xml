<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We examined associations of birth weight and <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> in infancy and early childhood with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (DM) risk in five cohorts from low- and middle-income countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Participants were 6,511 young adults from Brazil, Guatemala, India, the Philippines, and South Africa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Exposures were weight at birth, at 24 and 48 months, and adult weight, and conditional <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> (CWG, deviation from expected <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>) between these ages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Outcomes were adult fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> or DM (IFG/DM), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> homeostasis model assessment (IR-HOMA, three cohorts) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Birth weight was inversely associated with adult <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and risk of IFG/DM (odds ratio 0.91[95% CI 0.84-0.99] per SD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Weight at 24 and 48 months and CWG 0-24 and 24-48 months were unrelated to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and IFG/DM; however, CWG 48 months-adulthood was positively related to IFG/DM (1.32 [1.22-1.43] per SD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for adult waist circumference, birth weight, weight at 24 and 48 months and CWG 0-24 months were inversely associated with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and IFG/DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Birth weight was unrelated to IR-HOMA, whereas greater CWG at 0-24 and 24-48 months and 48 months-adulthood predicted higher IR-HOMA (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for adult waist circumference, birth weight was inversely related to IR-HOMA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Lower birth weight and accelerated <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> after 48 months are risk factors for adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Accelerated <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> between 0 and 24 months did not predict <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> but did predict higher <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
