<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Genome-wide nonparametric linkage analysis of 480 sib-pairs affected with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> revealed linkage to a previously unreported susceptibility locus on chromosome 18p11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This result improved with stringent subphenotyping using age- and sex-adjusted BMI, ultimately reaching a logarithm of odds of 3.82 (allele sharing 0.6654) at a point between markers D18S976 and D18S391 when the most <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> 20% of the sample was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several genes on chromosome 18 have been suggested as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disease</z:e> candidates, but none of these colocalize with our linkage result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We conclude that our results provide support for the presence of a currently uncharacterized gene on chromosome 18p, certain alleles of which confer increased susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in conjunction with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We additionally observed moderate evidence for linkage to chromosome 1, near marker D1S3462; chromosome 4, near marker D4S2361; chromosome 5, near marker D5S1505; and chromosome 17, near marker D17S1301 </plain></SENT>
