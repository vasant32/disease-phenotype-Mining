<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Intake of carbohydrates which elicit a large glycemic response is hypothesized to increase the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, studies assessing the relationship between glycemic index (GI) and glycemic load (GL) and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are inconsistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only few studies have studied the relationship between GI and GL and markers of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism, mostly in western populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between GI and GL and indices of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism and prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Greenland's Inuit population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: The Inuit Health in Transition Study is a geographically representative cross-sectional study among aged ≥18years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diet was assessed using a 67-item food frequency questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Logistic and linear regression was used to assess the association between GI and GL and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo>, HbA(1c), fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, 2h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, HOMA2-IR and HOMA2-%β </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No association was found between GI and GL and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>GL was significantly inversely associated with IFG (OR: 0.91 (0.84-0.98)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>While GI was positively associated with FPG, GL was positively associated with both HOMA2-IR and HOMA2-%β and inversely associated with IFG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings do not support a link between dietary GI or GL and risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among Greenland's Inuit population </plain></SENT>
