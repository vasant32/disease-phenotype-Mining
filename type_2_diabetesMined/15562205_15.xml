<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Early identification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD) in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is important because these patients are at increased risk for CAD and have worse outcome than nondiabetic patients after CAD is diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, noninvasive coronary angiography and assessment of left ventricular function has been demonstrated with multislice computed tomography (MSCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to validate this approach in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: MSCT was performed in 30 patients with confirmed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From the MSCT images, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242231" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary artery stenoses</z:e> (&gt; or =50% <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> narrowing) and left ventricular function (left ventricular ejection fraction, regional wall motion) were evaluated and compared with results of conventional angiography and two-dimensional echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two hundred twenty of 256 coronary artery segments (86%) were interpretable with MSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In these segments, sensitivity and specificity for detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242231" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary artery stenoses</z:e> were 95% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Including the uninterpretable segments, sensitivity and specificity were 81 and 82%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Bland-Altman analysis in the comparison of left ventricular ejection fractions demonstrated a mean difference of -0.48 +/- 3.8% for MSCT and echocardiography, which was not significantly different from 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Agreement between the two modalities for assessment of regional contractile function was excellent (91%, kappa statistic 0.81) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Accurate noninvasive evaluation of both the coronary arteries and left ventricular function with MSCT is feasible in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This noninvasive approach may allow optimal identification of high-risk patients </plain></SENT>
