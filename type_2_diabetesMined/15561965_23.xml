<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several reports suggest that a<z:chebi fb="1" ids="32722"> Gly--</z:chebi>&gt;Arg change in codon 972 is associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and related traits, and a recent meta-analysis reported a modest but nominally significant association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (odds ratio [OR] 1.25 in favor of carriers of the Arg allele [95% CI 1.05-1.48) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To test the reproducibility of the model in a recent meta-analysis, we examined genotype-phenotype correlation in three large Caucasian samples (not previously reported for this variant) totaling 9,000 individuals (estimated to have &gt;95% power to obtain a P &lt; 0.05 for the OR of 1.25 estimated in the meta-analysis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In our combined sample, comprising 4,279 case and 3,532 control subjects, as well as 1,189 siblings discordant for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, G972R was not associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (OR 0.96 [0.84-1.10], P = 0.60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genotype at G972R had no significant effect on various measures of insulin secretion or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in a set of Scandinavian samples in whom we had detailed phenotypic data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the well-documented associations of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma P12A and Kir6.2 E23K with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are both robustly observed in these 9,000 subjects, including an additional (previously unpublished) confirmation of Kir6.2 E23K and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the Polish and North American samples (combined OR 1.15 [1.05-1.26], P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite genotyping 9,000 people and &gt;95% power to reproduce the estimated OR from the recent meta-analysis, we were unable to replicate the association of the IRS-1 G972R polymorphism with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
