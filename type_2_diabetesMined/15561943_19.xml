<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The dogma that IGF-I stimulates pancreatic islet growth has been challenged by combinational targeting of IGF or IGF-IR (IGF receptor) genes as well as beta-cell-specific IGF-IR gene deficiency, which caused no defect in islet cell growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To assess the physiological role of locally produced IGF-I, we have developed pancreatic-specific IGF-I gene deficiency (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PID</z:chebi>) by crossing Pdx1-Cre and IGF-I/loxP mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PID</z:chebi> mice are <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> except for decreased blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level and a 2.3-fold <z:mp ids='MP_0009171'>enlarged islet cell</z:mp> mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When challenged with low doses of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi>, control mice developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> after 6 days that was maintained at high levels for at least 2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PID</z:chebi> mice only exhibited marginal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> after 12 days, maintained throughout the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifteen days after <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PID</z:chebi> mice demonstrated significantly higher levels of insulin production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi>-induced beta-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> (transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick-end labeling [TUNEL] assay) was significantly prevented in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PID</z:chebi> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PID</z:chebi> mice exhibited a delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> induced by a high-fat diet, accompanied by super <z:mp ids='MP_0009171'>enlarged pancreatic islets</z:mp>, increased insulin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels, and preserved sensitivity to insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that locally produced IGF-I within the pancreas inhibits islet cell growth; its deficiency provides a protective environment to the beta-cells and potential in combating <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
