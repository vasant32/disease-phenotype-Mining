<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A questionnaire, including the HRQoL-measured EQ-5D, was mailed to a random sample of 3,546 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (59.3% female) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The EQ-5D score was analyzed by grouping patients according to those on a DMP and those receiving routine care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The analysis showed that participation in the DMP (P &lt; 0.001), the number of other medical conditions (P &lt; 0.001), and the interaction between the DMP and the number of other conditions (P &lt; 0.05) had a significant impact on the EQ-5D score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the number of other medical conditions may have a negative impact on the HRQoL of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrate that the German DMP for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may help counterbalance this effect </plain></SENT>
