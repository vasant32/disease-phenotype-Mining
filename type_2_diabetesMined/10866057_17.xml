<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the hypothesis that modified <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> trigger an immune response leading to the production of autoantibodies and subsequently to the formation of atherogenic immune complexes (IC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We recruited 20 type 2 diabetic patients with macrovascular disease, 14 nondiabetic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD), and 34 healthy control subjects matched for age, sex, and race </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum antibodies to oxidized and glycated <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> did not differ significantly among the 3 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum IC contained variable, but not statistically different, amounts of IgG, IgM, and IgA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the content of cholesterol in IC isolated from diabetic patients was significantly higher than that in IC isolated from control subjects, and the content of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> (apo)-B was significantly higher than that in IC isolated from control subjects and patients with CAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cholesteryl <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> accumulation in human monocyte-derived macrophages incubated with IC, a measure of the atherogenic potential of IC, was significantly higher in macrophages incubated with red blood cell-adsorbed IC isolated from diabetic patients compared with IC isolated from control subjects (P &lt; 0.03) or from patients with CAD (P &lt; 0.04) and was strongly correlated with the content of apoB (r = 0.68, P &lt; 0.001) and cholesterol (r = 0.61, P &lt; 0.001) in IC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> from diabetic patients was more susceptible to oxidation in vitro, was significantly smaller, and contained significantly less <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22470">alpha-tocopherol</z:chebi> than <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> isolated from subjects in the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid content of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> and cholesteryl <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">esters</z:chebi> in <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> isolated from diabetic patients was significantly increased (P &lt; 0.05) compared with that from patients with CAD or from control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We postulate that <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> size, susceptibility to oxidation, and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> fatty acid composition may play a critical role in the production of antibodies to oxidized <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> and consequently in the formation of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-containing IC in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
