<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate the effect of an elevated plasma free fatty acid (FFA) concentration on SGU in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we measured SGU in eight diabetic patients (mean age 51 +/- 4 years, BMI 29.3 +/- 1.4 kg/m(2), fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> 9.3 +/- 0.7 mmol/l) during an intravenous Intralipid/<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> infusion and 7-10 days later during a saline infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SGU was estimated by the OGL insulin clamp method: subjects received a 7-h euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp (insulin infusion rate = 100 mU x m(-2) x min(-1)), and a 75-g OGL was ingested 3 h after starting the insulin clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> ingestion, the steady-state <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion rate during the insulin clamp was decreased appropriately to maintain euglycemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SGU was calculated by subtracting the integrated decrease in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion rate during the 4-h period after <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> ingestion from the ingested <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> load (75 g) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>3-[(3)H]<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was infused during the 3-h insulin clamp before <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> ingestion to determine the rates of endogenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disappearance (R(d)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intralipid/<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> or saline infusion was initiated 2 h before the start of the OGL clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasma FFA concentrations were significantly higher during the OGL clamp with the intralipid/<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> infusion than with the saline infusion (2.5 +/- 0.3 vs. 0.11 +/- 0.02 mmol/l, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During the 3-h insulin clamp period before <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> ingestion, Intralipid/<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> infusion reduced R(d) (4.4 +/- 0.3 vs. 5.3 +/- 0.3 mg x kg(-1) x min(-1), P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During the 4-h period after <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> ingestion, SGU was significantly decreased during the intralipid/<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> versus saline infusion (30 +/- 2 vs. 37 +/- 2%, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
