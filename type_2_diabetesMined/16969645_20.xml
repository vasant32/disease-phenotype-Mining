<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data at baseline and at 3 years from the D.E.S.I.R. cohort were used, comprising 2,071 men and 2,130 women without baseline <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Changes in GGT level were correlated with changes in markers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (fasting insulin, homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>), as well as with the following elements of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e>: central <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and increased fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> and blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 3-year increase in GGT was associated with incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in both sexes, after adjusting for age and baseline GGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After further adjustment for baseline confounding factors, including alanine-aminotransferase, alcohol intake, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and fasting insulin, the odds ratios (95% CI) for an association between incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and unchanged or increased (as opposed to decreased) GGT levels were 2.54 (1.38-4.68) in men (p=0.003) and 2.78 (1.20-6.42) in women (p=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These associations were slightly attenuated after adjusting for the 3-year change in BMI, alcohol consumption and fasting insulin, the odds ratios being 2.49 (1.28-4.86) in men and 2.53 (1.01-6.40) in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This relationship was not dependent on intra-individual variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: An unchanged or increased GGT level over time, even when GGT is in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range, is correlated with increasing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and is associated with a risk of incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in both sexes, independently of baseline GGT, which is itself a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk factor </plain></SENT>
