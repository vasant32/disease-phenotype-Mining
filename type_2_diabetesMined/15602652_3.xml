<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As the small, dense <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> phenotype is a typical feature of the dyslipidaemic state found in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, this characteristic could be an important mediator of the elevated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> risk in this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have therefore studied the effect of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on various electrophoretic characteristics of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> particles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Potential differences in <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> peak particle size and in concentration of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> in small (&lt;255 A) and large (&gt;260 A) <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> particles were assessed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gradient gel electrophoresis among 183 non-diabetic and 56 type 2 diabetic women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> peak particle size was significantly smaller in type 2 diabetic women than in non-diabetic women (p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the proportion of small <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> particles (&lt;255 A) was higher in type 2 diabetic women, whereas the proportion of large <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> particles (&gt;260 A) was lower than in non-diabetic women (p&lt;0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Type 2 diabetic women also had the highest waist circumference and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels (p&lt;0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When subgroups of non-diabetic and type 2 diabetic women were individually matched (n=41) for similar waist circumference and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels, the differences initially found in <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> peak particle size and in the proportion of small and large <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> particles remained significantly different between the two groups (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These results provide evidence that type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may have an independent effect on <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> peak particle size and on the proportion of small and large <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> particles </plain></SENT>
