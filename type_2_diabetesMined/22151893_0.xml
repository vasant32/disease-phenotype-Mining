<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: ZDF rats at 20 weeks of age were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> (10 mg/kg/day) during 6 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effect of the drug on glycaemia was assessed by evaluating glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The content and/or distribution of tight junction (TJ) proteins occludin and claudin-5, as well as nitrotyrosine residues, interleukin (IL)-1Î², BAX and Bcl-2 was evaluated in the retinas by western blotting and/or immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">Retinal</z:chebi> cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was assessed by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick-end labelling (TUNEL) assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of CD34+ cells present in peripheral circulation was assessed by flow cytometry, and endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> ability to the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vessels was evaluated by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">Sitagliptin</z:chebi> improved glycaemic control as reflected by a significant decrease in HbA1c levels by about 1.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> prevented the changes in the endothelial subcellular distribution of the TJ proteins induced by <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">Sitagliptin</z:chebi> also decreased the nitrosative stress, the inflammatory state and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in diabetic retinas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Diabetic animals presented decreased levels of CD34+ cells in the peripheral circulation and decreased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> ability of EPC to the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">Sitagliptin</z:chebi> allowed a recovery of the number of CD34+ cells present in the bloodstream to levels similar to their number in controls and increased the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> ability of EPC to the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">Sitagliptin</z:chebi> prevented nitrosative stress, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> cells and exerted beneficial effects on the blood-<z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> barrier integrity in ZDF rat retinas </plain></SENT>
