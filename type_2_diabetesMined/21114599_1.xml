<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is a medical need for GLP-1 analogues that can be administered less frequently for patient convenience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We synthesized a series of human GLP-1 (hGLP-1(7-36)NH(2) ) derivatives containing α-aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) substitutions, analysed their enzymatic stabilities and evaluated their secondary structures using circular dichroism (CD) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Plasma stability experiments showed that only the analogue containing Aib substitutions in both the N-terminus (position 8) and the C-terminus (position 35), [Aib⁸(,)³⁵]hGLP-1(7-36)NH₂ (BIM-51077), was fully resistant to enzymatic cleavage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Incubation with human plasma kallikrein or plasmin confirmed that the Aib substitution at position 35 prevented protease cleavage around this residue, which contributes to the significantly enhanced plasma stability and increased plasma half-life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CD revealed increased C-terminal α-helicity in Aib³⁵-substituted analogues compared with both hGLP-1(7-36)NH₂ and analogues containing only Aib⁸ substitutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on NMR studies, the secondary structure of BIM-51077 is similar to hGLP-1(7-36)NH₂ with a slight increase in α-helicity in the C-terminus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with hGLP-1(7-36)NH₂, BIM-51077 had similar binding affinity for the human GLP-1 receptor and activated this receptor with similar potency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We have discovered an Aib⁸(,)³⁵-substituted analogue of native hGLP-1(7-36)NH₂ (BIM-51077) that retains the structure of the native <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, and has similar activity and enhanced stability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A sustained-release formulation of this molecule (taspoglutide) is in phase-3 clinical development </plain></SENT>
