<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To assess the efficacy and safety of adding alogliptin versus uptitrating <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and inadequate glycaemic control on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group study, patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and A1c ≥7.0 and ≤10.0% on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (≥1500 mg or maximum tolerated dose; Met) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> 30 mg (Pio30) received alogliptin 25 mg (Alo25; n = 404) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> 15 mg (n = 399) added to Met+Pio30 for 52 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was change from baseline (CFB) in A1c at weeks 26 and 52, with sequential testing for non-inferiority of Met+Pio30+Alo25 at weeks 26 and 52 and then for superiority at week 52 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Met+Pio30+Alo25 showed superior glycaemic control versus Met+Pio45 at week 52 [least squares (LS) mean CFB in A1c, -0.70 vs. -0.29%; p &lt; 0.001] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At week 52, Met+Pio30+Alo25 resulted in greater CFB in A1c regardless of baseline A1c (p &lt; 0.001); higher proportions of patients achieving A1c ≤7.0 (33.2 vs. 21.3%) and ≤6.5% (8.7 vs. 4.3%; p &lt; 0.001); greater CFB in fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG; LS mean CFB, -0.8 vs. -0.2 mmol/L; p &lt; 0.001); and greater improvements in measures of β-cell function (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hypoglycaemia</z:e> incidence was low (Met+Pio30+Alo25, 4.5%; Met+Pio45, 1.5%), mostly mild to moderate, but with two severe events in the Met+Pio30+Alo25 group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No meaningful differences in incidences of individual adverse events were observed between treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Adding alogliptin to an existing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> regimen provided superior glycaemic control and potentially improved β-cell function versus uptitrating <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, with no clinically important differences in safety </plain></SENT>
