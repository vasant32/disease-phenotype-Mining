<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is possible that postprandial hyperglucagonemia in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is due to impaired postprandial insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To address this, we studied eight adult Goettingen minipigs before and after an approximately 60% reduction in beta-cell mass induced by alloxan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pigs were studied fasting and after ingestion of a mixed meal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Insulin and glucagon secretion were determined by deconvolution of blood hormone concentrations measured at 1-min intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relationship between insulin and glucagon release was analyzed using cross-correlation and forward versus reverse cross-approximate entropy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We report that glucagon and insulin were secreted in approximately 4-min pulses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prealloxan, postprandial insulin secretion drove an approximately 20% suppression of glucagon concentrations (P &lt; 0.01), through inhibition of glucagon pulse mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The alloxan-induced approximately 60% deficit in beta-cell mass lead to an approximately 70% deficit in postprandial insulin secretion and loss of the postprandial insulin-driven suppression of glucagon secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that postprandial hyperglucagonemia in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is likely due to loss of intraislet postprandial suppression of glucagon secretion by insulin </plain></SENT>
