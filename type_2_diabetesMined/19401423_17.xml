<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Given that FGF-21 has been suggested to be a peroxisome proliferator-activator receptor (PPAR) alpha-dependent regulator of fasting metabolism, we hypothesized that free fatty acids (FFAs), natural <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> of PPARalpha, might modify FGF-21 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The effect of fatty acids on FGF-21 was investigated in vitro in HepG2 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Within a randomized controlled trial, the effects of elevated FFAs were studied in 21 healthy subjects (13 women and 8 men) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Within a clinical trial including 17 individuals, the effect of insulin was analyzed using an hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp and the effect of PPARgamma activation was studied subsequently in a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> treatment trial over 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30823">Oleate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30245">linoleate</z:chebi> increased FGF-21 expression and secretion in a PPARalpha-dependent fashion, as demonstrated by small-interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-induced PPARalpha knockdown, while <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> had no effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vivo, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> infusion induced an increase of circulating FGF-21 in humans, and a strong correlation between the change in FGF-21 levels and the change in FFAs was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An artificial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo>, which was induced to delineate the potential interaction between elevated FFAs and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo>, revealed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> also increased FGF-21 levels in vivo, while <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> treatment had no effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results presented here offer a mechanism explaining the induction of the metabolic regulator FGF-21 in the fasting situation but also in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
