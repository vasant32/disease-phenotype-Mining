<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Blood samples were analyzed in a Couette rheometer at 32 MHz following shear rate reductions from 500 s(-1) to residual shears of 0 (stasis), 1, 2, 10, 50, 100, and 200 s(-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The increase in EA was determined with the integrated backscatter coefficient as a function of time and shear rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The time required to form aggregates was shorter in diabetic patients at shear rates below 200 s(-1) (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Erythrocytes formed larger aggregates in diabetic patients than in control subjects (P &lt; 0.05 at 2 to 100 s(-1)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound can potentially noninvasively demonstrate, in vivo and in situ, the impact of local abnormal EA on arteriovenous flow disorders in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
