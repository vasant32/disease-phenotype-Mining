<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Although an excess transmission of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from mothers has been documented, whether this is an independent trait or whether the effect can be detected early through risk factors for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> remains to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence of and the possible prospective effect of family history on type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence adjusted for multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk factors in a 22.5-year follow-up study of healthy men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 1,947 apparently healthy nondiabetic men with fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FBG) levels &lt;110 mg/dl at baseline, in whom an intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (IVGTT) was administered and several conventional risk factors were measured, were followed for 22.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Family history data were obtained at the baseline examination, and morbidity data were obtained from repeated investigations, hospital records, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> certificates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 131 men reported <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>maternal diabetes</z:hpo> family history only, 65 men reported paternal <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> family history only and 10 men reported both maternal and paternal <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> family history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the 1,947 men, 143 cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> developed during 22.5 years of observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Maternal family history and combined maternal and paternal family history predisposed to future type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> both in univariate Cox analysis and in multivariate Cox regression analysis after adjusting for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disappearance rate (Rd) during an IVGTT, FBG level, BMI, physical fitness, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> level, and age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Maternal family history showed a relative risk (RR) of 2.51 (95% CI 1.55-4.07), combined maternal and paternal family history showed an RR of 3.96 (1.22-12.9), and paternal family history showed an RR of 1.41 (0.657-3.05) in multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Maternal family history appears to be an important risk factor for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> independent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetic</z:e> Rd, FBG, BMI, and physical fitness levels </plain></SENT>
