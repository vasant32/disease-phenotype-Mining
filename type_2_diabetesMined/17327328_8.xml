<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms of these interactions depend on poorly known factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to study the contribution of the serum soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Circulating sTfR was evaluated in 221 men (97 with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance [NGT], 36 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo>, and 88 with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a subset of these subjects, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test [OGTT]), minimal model-derived insulin sensitivity, and sTfR during the OGTT were also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Men with altered <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance showed significantly increased sTfR (9.4 +/- 4.4 vs. 8.2 +/- 2.6 microg/ml, P = 0.02) and higher serum ferritin than men with NGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum sTfR was negatively associated with serum ferritin (r = -0.16, P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>sTfR correlated with several clinical and metabolic variables such as systolic blood pressure, glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin values during OGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity was also negatively associated with sTfR in NGT and nonobese subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>BMI (P = 0.01), serum ferritin (P = 0.025), and insulin sensitivity (P &lt; 0.0001) contributed independently to 21% of sTfR variance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Serum sTfR concentration did not significantly change during the OGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Both insulin sensitivity and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance status are significantly associated with serum sTfR concentrations, although insulin sensitivity predicts independently circulating sTfR, mainly in subjects with NGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The implications of the interrelationships between iron and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism should be investigated further </plain></SENT>
