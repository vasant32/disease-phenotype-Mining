<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> were hospitalized and treated with intensive insulin injections for 10-14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) was performed after intensive insulin treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After discharge, the patients were randomized to receive either insulin injections or oral antidiabetes drugs (OADs) for further management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The OGTT was repeated 6 months later, and beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity were evaluated again </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These subjects were continually followed up for another 6 months to evaluate their long-term glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At the 6th month of the study, the A1C level was significantly lower in the insulin group than in the OAD group (6.33 +/- 0.70% vs. 7.50 +/- 1.50%; P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up visit, the A1C level was still better in the insulin group (6.78 +/- 1.21% vs. 7.84 +/- 1.74%; P = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> parameters regarding beta-cell function measured in the OGTT were improved significantly in both groups after 6 months of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with the OAD group, the homeostasis model assessment of beta-cell function index, insulin area under the curve, and insulinogenic index were better in the insulin group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A 6-month course of insulin therapy, compared with OAD treatment, could more effectively achieve adequate glycemic control and significant improvement of beta-cell function in new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 diabetic patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
