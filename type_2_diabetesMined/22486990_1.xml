<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the choice of a second-line drug lacks consistent consensus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to assess available information of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs added to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> on the change in glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (A1C), risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> and change in body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: PubMed and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) written in English through December 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We analysed direct and indirect comparisons of different treatments using Bayesian network meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-nine RCTs involving 17 860 individuals were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) analogues resulted in greater decrease in A1C compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi>, glinides, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi>, α-glucosidase inhibitors and DPP-4 inhibitors [-0.20% (95% CI -0.34 to -0.04%), -0.31% (95% CI -0.61 to -0.02%), -0.20% (95% CI -0.38 to -0.00), -0.36% (95% CI -0.64 to -0.07%), -0.32% (95% CI -0.47 to -0.17%), respectively] and was comparable with basal insulin and biphasic insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A1C decrease was greater for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> compared with DPP-4 inhibitors [-0.12% (-0.23 to -0.03%)], and for biphasic insulin compared with glinides (-0.36%; 95% CI -0.82 to -0.11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with placebo, the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> was increased in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi>, glinides, basal insulin and biphasic insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Weight increase was seen with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi>, glinides, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi>, basal insulin and biphasic insulin, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> was seen with α-glucosidase inhibitors and GLP-1 analogues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Biphasic insulin, GLP-1 analogues and basal insulin were ranked the top three drugs in terms of A1C reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>GLP-1 analogues did not increase the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> and resulted in a significant decrease in body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Most oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs had similar effects on A1C, but some agents had a lower risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> and body <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
