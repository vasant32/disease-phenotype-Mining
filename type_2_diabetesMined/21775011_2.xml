<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> activates platelets; activated platelets release <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi>, and therefore, evaluation of <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> levels in blood could be a valuable biomarker for future risk of cardiovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Plasma <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> levels obtained from patients with DM complicated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> were measured using HPLC and were compared to <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> levels of healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with DM were classified into 2 subgroups of mildly (group 1) and moderately/severely (group 2) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>impaired renal function</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">Serotonin</z:chebi> concentration in platelet-poor plasma for group 1 was significantly higher than that of healthy control subjects (p &lt; 0.01), and was significantly higher than that of patients from group 2 (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The concentration of <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> in whole blood for group 2 patients was significantly lower than that measured from healthy control subjects (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ratio of the plasma to whole blood level was significantly elevated in both groups 1 and 2 compared with healthy controls (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that platelets are activated to release <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> into plasma in diabetic patients with mildly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>impaired renal function</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When renal damage is advanced, platelets are over-activated to release <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
