<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Women who completed the TRIPOD study were offered participation in the PIPOD study for a planned 3 years of drug treatment and 6 months of postdrug washout </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests were performed annually on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> and at the end of the postdrug washout </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests (IVGTTs) for assessment of insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function were conducted at baseline, after 1 year on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>, and at the end of the postdrug washout </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of 95 women who were not diabetic at the end of the TRIPOD study, 89 enrolled in the PIPOD study, 86 completed at least one follow-up visit, and 65 completed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> study visits, including the postdrug tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparison of changes in beta-cell compensation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> across the TRIPOD and PIPOD studies revealed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> stopped the decline in beta-cell function that occurred during placebo treatment in the TRIPOD study and maintained the stability of beta-cell function that had occurred during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> treatment in the TRIPOD study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, which occurred at an average rate of 4.6% per year, was lowest in women with the largest reduction in total IVGTT insulin area after 1 year of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The similarity of findings between the PIPOD and TRIPOD studies support a class effect of thiazolidinedione drugs to enhance insulin sensitivity, reduce insulin secretory demands, and preserve pancreatic beta-cell function, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> in association with a relatively low rate of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, in Hispanic women with prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
