<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male and female rats were maintained on a high-<z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> diet for 5-11 weeks, and mechanical properties of isolated ventricular myocytes were measured by high-speed video edge detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several in vitro interventions were used to manipulate intracellular Ca(2+) in order to determine whether altered Ca(2+) availability contributes to the cardiomyocyte dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Myocyte shortening and relengthening were significantly slower in <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi>-fed (insulin-resistant) males than in <z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">starch</z:chebi>-fed (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>) male rats, whereas only relengthening was slower in <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi>-fed females when compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Areas under the contraction and relaxation phases for <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi>-fed males were also significantly larger than in diet-matched females, and the slowed cardiomyocyte mechanics appeared earlier in males (7 vs 10 weeks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prolonged relaxation was ameliorated in myocytes from <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi>-fed female rats by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> interventions (i.e. 10(-8) mol/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6257">l isoprenaline</z:chebi>, elevated extracellular Ca(2+), and higher rates of stimulation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twice as much extracellular Ca(2+) (4 mmol/l) was required to restore <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> time courses of contraction and relaxation in <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi>-fed males than in females, and mechanical responses to higher frequency stimulation remained impaired (slower) in some myocytes from <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi>-fed male rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These data suggest that in myocytes from insulin-resistant rats altered Ca(2+) handling occurs, contributing to abnormal excitation-contraction coupling; female rats seem to have some cardioprotection during early stages in the progression towards type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Females show delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and milder abnormalities in metabolic status and cardiomyocyte function, but with a much tighter temporal coupling of these dysfunctions </plain></SENT>
