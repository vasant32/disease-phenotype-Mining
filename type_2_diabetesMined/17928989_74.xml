<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in these genes and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in participants from the Japanese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixteen previously reported SNPs were genotyped in 864 Japanese type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> individuals (535 men and 329 women; age 63.1 +/- 9.5 years (mean+/-SD), BMI 24.3 +/- 3.9 kg/m(2)) and 864 Japanese control individuals (386 men and 478 women; age 69.5 +/- 6.8 years, BMI 23.8 +/- 3.7 kg/m(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The SNPs rs5015480 [odds ratio (OR) = 1.46 (95% CI 1.20-1.77), p = 2.0 x 10(-4)], rs7923837 [OR = 1.40 (95% CI 1.17-1.68), p = 2.0 x 10(-4)] and rs1111875 [OR = 1.30 (95% CI 1.11-1.52), p = 0.0013] in HHEX were significantly associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with the same direction as previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SNP rs8050136 in FTO was nominally associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> [OR = 1.22 (95% CI 1.03-1.46), p = 0.025] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SNPs in other genes such as rs7756992 in CDKAL1, rs10811661 in CDKN2B and rs13266634 in SLC30A8 showed nominal association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>rs7756992 in CDKAL1 and rs10811661 in CDKN2B were correlated with impaired pancreatic beta cell function as estimated by the homeostasis model assessment beta index (p = 0.023, p = 0.0083, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: HHEX is a common type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-susceptibility gene across different ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
