<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we examined DNA methylation of the insulin gene promoter in pancreatic islets from patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and non-diabetic human donors and related it to insulin expression, HbA(1c) levels, BMI and age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: DNA methylation was analysed in 25 CpG sites of the insulin promoter and insulin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was analysed using quantitative RT-PCR in pancreatic islets from nine donors with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 48 non-diabetic donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Insulin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression (p = 0.002), insulin content (p = 0.004) and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion (p = 0.04) were reduced in pancreatic islets from patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with non-diabetic donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, four CpG sites located 234 bp, 180 and 102 bp upstream and 63 bp downstream of the transcription start site (CpG -234, -180, -102 and +63, respectively), showed increased DNA methylation in type 2 diabetic compared with non-diabetic islets (7.8%, p = 0.03; 7.1%, p = 0.02; 4.4%, p = 0.03 and 9.3%, p = 0.03, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While insulin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression correlated negatively (p &lt; 1 × 10(-6)), the level of HbA(1c) correlated positively (p ≤ 0.01) with the degree of DNA methylation for CpG -234, -180 and +63 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, DNA methylation for nine additional CpG sites correlated negatively with insulin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression (p ≤ 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also, exposure to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> for 72 h increased insulin promoter DNA methylation in clonal rat beta cells (p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATIONS: This study demonstrates that DNA methylation of the insulin promoter is increased in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and correlates negatively with insulin gene expression in human pancreatic islets </plain></SENT>
