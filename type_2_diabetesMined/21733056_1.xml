<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of repeated doses of RE in subjects with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, subjects who were drug-na√Øve or had <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> discontinued received RE [100 mg BID (n = 9), 1000 mg QD (n = 9), 1000 mg BID (n = 9)], or placebo (n = 8) for 12 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Safety parameters were assessed, including urine studies to evaluate renal function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma concentrations of RE and metabolites were measured with the first dose and at steady state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RE effects on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were assessed with fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations, frequently sampled 24-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> profiles and oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001939'>laboratory abnormalities</z:hpo> or safety events were reported; the most frequent adverse events were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and flatulence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasma exposure to RE and R were proportional to administered dose with negligible accumulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean 24-h UGE increased in RE treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with the placebo group, 24-h mean (95% CI) changes in plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> were -1.2 (-2.2 to -0.3) (100 mg BID), -0.8 (-1.7 to 0.2) (1000 mg QD) and -1.7 (-2.7 to -0.8) mmol/l (1000 mg BID) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Administration of RE for 12 days is well-tolerated and results in clinically meaningful improvements in plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, accompanied by changes in body weight and blood pressure in subjects with T2DM </plain></SENT>
