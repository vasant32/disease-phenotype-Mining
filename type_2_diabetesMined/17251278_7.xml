<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to quantify the expression of muscle GLUT in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and to determine if treatment with an insulin-enhancing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50991">thiazolidenedione</z:chebi> drug, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>, would alter its expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Twelve patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were randomly assigned to treatment with either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> or placebo in a double-blinded 8-week protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> for GLUT4 and GLUT5 were quantified in muscle homogenates from biopsies of vastus lateralis before and after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The five additional GLUT family isoforms expressed in muscle had <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> quantified in these samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Baseline and posttreatment repeat measurements of GLUT4 protein were not different from control measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, GLUT5 protein increased 2.5-fold, and GLUT5 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was 82% higher in the pretreatment samples from the diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Concentrations of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> for the six other GLUTs (GLUT1, GLUT3, GLUT4, GLUT8, GLUT11, and GLUT12) were not different from control subjects before or after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The proportion of type I (red) fibers (46%) in diabetic muscle was not affected by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">Pioglitazone</z:chebi> treatment decreased muscle GLUT5 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein by 52 and 40%, respectively, whereas placebo did not alter GLUT5 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both red and white fibers had higher GLUT5 expression in the baseline diabetic muscle samples, and a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>-related decrease in GLUT5 protein also occurred in both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: GLUT5 was dramatically increased in diabetic muscle, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> treatment reversed this overexpression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The role of this <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28757">fructose</z:chebi> transporter expression in the insulin-enhancing effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> in muscle is unclear </plain></SENT>
