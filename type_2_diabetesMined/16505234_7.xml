<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have recently reported that c-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28911">Cbl</z:chebi>(-/-) mice exhibit a lean phenotype and enhanced peripheral insulin action likely due to elevated energy expenditure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the study reported here, we examined the effect of a high-fat diet on energy homeostasis and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in these animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When c-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28911">Cbl</z:chebi>(-/-) mice were fed a high-fat diet for 4 weeks, they maintained <z:hpo ids='HP_0002591'>hyperphagia</z:hpo>, higher whole-body oxygen consumption (27%), and greater activity (threefold) compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> animals fed the same diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, the activity of several enzymes involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> fat oxidation and the phosphorylation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15351">acetyl CoA</z:chebi> carboxylase was significantly increased in muscle of high-fat-fed c-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28911">Cbl</z:chebi>-deficient mice, indicating a greater capacity for fat oxidation in these animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As a result of these differences, fat-fed c-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28911">Cbl</z:chebi>(-/-) mice were 30% leaner than <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> animals and were protected against high-fat diet-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These studies are consistent with a role for c-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28911">Cbl</z:chebi> in regulating nutrient partitioning in skeletal muscle and emphasize the potential of c-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28911">Cbl</z:chebi> as a therapeutic target in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
