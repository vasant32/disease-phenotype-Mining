<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Scientific evidence showed that specific treatment of this disease could be successfully tailored on the basis of proper differential diagnosis that in many instances also requires genetic testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This may be helpful in achieving metabolic control of the disease, increasing quality of life and potentially reducing the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Identification of the molecular background of these specific forms of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> gives new insight into the underlying aetiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This knowledge helps to optimize treatment in specific clinical situations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Monogenic <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is an excellent example of a clinical area where new advances in molecular genetics can aid patient care and treatment decisions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most frequently diagnosed forms of monogenic <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are MODY, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, permanent and transient neonatal <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (PNDM and TNDM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These rare forms probably constitute at least a few percent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> cases seen in diabetic clinics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The proper differential diagnosis also helps to predict the progress of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in affected individuals and defines the prognosis in the family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Recently, several genome wide association studies added new facts to the knowledge on complex forms of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) as the scientists substantially extended the short list of previously identified genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Most newly identified variants influence beta-cell insulin secretion, while a few modulate peripheral insulin action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is not clear whether in the future the genetic testing of frequent polymorphisms will influence the treatment of T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In this review, we present the clinical application of genetic testing in non-autoimmune <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, mostly monogenic forms of disease </plain></SENT>
