<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, SOCS1 is considered a candidate gene in the pathogenesis of both type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T1D) and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2D) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective was to perform mutation analysis of SOCS1 and to test the identified variations for association to T2D-related quantitative traits, T2D or T1D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Mutation scanning was performed by direct sequencing in 27 white Danish subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genotyping was carried out by TaqMan allelic discrimination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of more than 8100 individuals were genotyped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight variations were identified in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two of these had allele frequencies below 1% and were not further examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The six other variants were analysed in groups of T1D families (n = 1461 subjects) and T2D patients (n = 1430), <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerant first-degree relatives of T2D patients (n = 212) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerant (NGT) subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The rs33977706 polymorphism (-820G &gt; T) was associated with a lower body mass index (BMI) (p = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In a second study (n = 4625 NGT subjects), significant associations of both the rs33977706 and the rs243330 (-1656G &gt; A) variants to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> were found (p = 0.047 and p = 0.015) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The rs33977706 affected both binding of a nuclear protein to and the transcriptional activity of the SOCS1 promoter, indicating a relationship between this polymorphism and gene regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: This study demonstrates that functional variations in the SOCS1 promoter may associate with alterations in BMI in the general white population </plain></SENT>
