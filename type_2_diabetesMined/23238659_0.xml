<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We directly standardized age- and sex-adjusted prevalence rates of proteinuric DKD (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> with or without low estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]) or nonproteinuric DKD (low eGFR alone) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We calculated sex-specific odds ratios (ORs) of DKD in racial/ethnic minorities (relative to NHWs) after adjustment for traditional DKD risk factors.RESULTSRacial/ethnic minorities had higher rates of proteinuric DKD than NHWs (24.8-37.9 vs. 24.8%) and lower rates of nonproteinuric DKD (6.3-9.8 vs. 11.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On adjusted analyses, Chinese (odds ratio 1.39 for women and 1.56 for men), Filipinos (1.57 for women and 1.85 for men), Hispanics (1.46 for women and 1.34 for men), and NHBs (1.50 for women) exhibited significantly (P &lt; 0.01) higher odds of proteinuric DKD than NHWs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conversely, Chinese, Hispanic, and NHB women and Hispanic men had significantly lower odds of nonproteinuric DKD than NHWs.CONCLUSIONSWe found novel racial/ethnic differences in DKD among patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Racial/ethnic minorities were more likely to have proteinuric DKD and less likely to have nonproteinuric DKD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Future research should examine diverse DKD-related outcomes by race/ethnicity to inform targeted prevention and treatment efforts and to explore the etiology of these differences </plain></SENT>
