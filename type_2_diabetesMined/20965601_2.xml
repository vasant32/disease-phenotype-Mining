<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 100 persons with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (mean age 64.5 Â± 9.4 years) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Persons with manifest mobility limitations were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Possible determinants measured: <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo>, neuropathic pain, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral arterial disease</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, decreased muscle strength (handgrip strength), BMI, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> and fear of falling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Walking activity was measured during one week with a pedometer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Functional capacity was measured with the 6 min walk test, the timed "up and go" test and a stair climbing test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> (40%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (53%) was high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Persons took a median of 6429 steps/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In multivariate regression analysis, adjusted for age and sex, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> was associated with a reduction of 1967 steps/day, decreased muscle strength with 1782 steps/day, and an increase in BMI of 1 kg/m(2) with a decrease of 210 steps/day (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Decreased muscle strength and BMI, but not <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e>, were associated with outcome of functional capacity tests in multiple regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo>, decreased muscle strength and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> are strongly associated with walking in persons with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> without manifest mobility limitations </plain></SENT>
