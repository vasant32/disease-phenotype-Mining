<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many standard <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treatments, however, fail to achieve or maintain glycaemic control, and are often associated with an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently developed incretin-based therapies are a promising addition to the current armamentarium of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two types of incretin-based therapies are currently available: glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (GLP)-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> (liraglutide and exenatide) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (sitaglipin, vildagliptin and saxagliptin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This review aims to summarize the key efficacy and safety data of liraglutide, a once-daily human GLP-1 analogue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Extensive phase III clinical trials have shown liraglutide to improve glycaemic control with additional benefits on body weight, blood pressure and Î²-cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Liraglutide is also generally well tolerated with a low risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
