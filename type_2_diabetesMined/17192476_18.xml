<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Indeed, <z:mp ids='MP_0011612'>hyperghrelinemia</z:mp> appears to promote an increase in food intake as seen in Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Exendin (Ex)-4 is an <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> of the glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (GLP)-1 receptor (GLP-1r) that has anorexigenic and fat-reducing properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we report that Ex-4 reduces the levels of ghrelin by up to 74% in fasted rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These effects are dose dependent and long lasting (up to 8 h), and they can be detected after both central and peripheral administration of Ex-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Suppression of ghrelin was neither mimicked by GLP-1(7-36)-NH(2) nor blocked by the GLP-1r antagonist Ex-(9-39) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, it was independent of the levels of leptin and insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The decrease in ghrelin levels induced by Ex-4 may explain the reduced food intake in fasted rats, justifying the more potent anorexigenic effects of Ex-4 when compared with GLP-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As well as the potential benefits of Ex-4 in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the potent effects of Ex-4 on ghrelin make it tempting to speculate that Ex-4 could offer a therapeutic option for PWS and other syndromes characterized by substantial amounts of circulating ghrelin </plain></SENT>
