<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To estimate the odds and prevalence of clinically relevant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in adults with type 1 or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> and an increased risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e>; relief of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> is associated with improved glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A more accurate estimate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> prevalence than what is currently available is needed to gauge the potential impact of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> management in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: MEDLINE and PsycINFO databases and published references were used to identify studies that reported the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prevalence was calculated as an aggregate mean weighted by the combined number of subjects in the included studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used chi(2) statistics and odds ratios (ORs) to assess the rate and likelihood of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> as a function of type of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, sex, subject source, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> assessment method, and study design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 42 eligible studies were identified; 20 (48%) included a nondiabetic comparison group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the controlled studies, the odds of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in the diabetic group were twice that of the nondiabetic comparison group (OR = 2.0, 95% CI 1.8-2.2) and did not differ by sex, type of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, subject source, or assessment method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of comorbid <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> was significantly higher in diabetic women (28%) than in diabetic men (18%), in uncontrolled (30%) than in controlled studies (21%), in clinical (32%) than in community (20%) samples, and when assessed by self-report questionnaires (31%) than by standardized diagnostic interviews (11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> doubles the odds of comorbid <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Prevalence estimates are affected by several clinical and methodological variables that do not affect the stability of the ORs </plain></SENT>
