<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate transmission patterns of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and their relationships with clinical characteristics in Hong Kong Chinese patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> (age &gt; or =35 years) type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This study involved 2,310 patients consecutively selected from a hospital clinic-based <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These patients <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> reported the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> status of their parents as well as siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Approximately 36% of the 2,310 patients reported at least 1 affected parent or sibling (25 and 21% reported at least 1 diabetic parent and sibling, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These patients, irrespective of their sex, were more likely to have a diabetic mother than a diabetic father (17 vs. 13% of the male patients and 18 vs. 9% of the female patients, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The male patients were more likely than the female patients to have a diabetic father (13 vs. 9%, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The female patients with a diabetic mother were found to have higher levels of plasma total cholesterol compared with the female patients with a diabetic father in multiple comparisons with adjustment for significance (5.56+/-1.30 vs. 5.09+/-0.95 mmol/l, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 2-group comparisons, there was also evidence that the male patients with a diabetic father had higher BMI values than the male patients with a diabetic mother (25.9+/-3.5 vs. 25.0+/-3.5 kg/m2, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found familial clustering of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the Hong Kong Chinese population as well as a significant maternal influence and a male sex-specific <z:mp ids='MP_0010723'>paternal effect</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We suggest that both maternal and paternal factors may be implicated in the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the Chinese population </plain></SENT>
