<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive the initial combination of 30 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> plus 5 mg linagliptin (n = 259) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> plus placebo (n = 130), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> once daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was change from baseline in HbA1c after 24 weeks of treatment, adjusted for baseline HbA1c and prior antidiabetes medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 24 weeks of treatment, the adjusted mean change (±s.e.) in HbA1c with the initial combination of linagliptin plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> was -1.06% (±0.06), compared with -0.56% (±0.09) for placebo plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The difference in adjusted mean HbA1c in the linagliptin group compared with placebo was -0.51% (95% confidence interval [CI] -0.71, -0.30; p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reductions in fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) were significantly greater for linagliptin plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> than with placebo plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>; -1.8 and -1.0 mmol/l, respectively, equating to a treatment difference of -0.8 mmol/l (95% CI -1.2, -0.4; p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients taking linagliptin plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>, compared with those receiving placebo plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>, were more likely to achieve HbA1c of &lt;7.0% (42.9 vs. 30.5%, respectively; p = 0.0051) and reduction in HbA1c of ≥0.5% (75.0 vs. 50.8%, respectively; p &lt; 0.0001). β-cell function, exemplified by the ratio of relative change in adjusted mean HOMA-IR and disposition index, improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The proportion of patients that experienced at least one adverse event was similar for both groups </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Initial combination therapy with linagliptin plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> was well tolerated and produced significant and clinically meaningful improvements in glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This combination may offer a valuable additive initial treatment option for T2DM, particularly where <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> either is not well tolerated or is contraindicated, such as in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal impairment</z:e> </plain></SENT>
