<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several studies point to a similar mechanism at the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) GWAS locus for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To address this possibility, we carried out an in vitro scan of this <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-associated locus to fine-map cis-regulatory sequences within this genomic interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A systematic cell-based enhancer strategy was employed to interrogate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sequences within the 92 kb type-2-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-association interval for cis-regulatory activity in a panel of cell lines (HCT-116, Neuro-2a, C2C12, U2OS, MIN6 and HepG2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We further evaluated chromatin state at a subset of these regions in HCT-116 and U2OS cells and examined allelic-specific enhancer properties at the type-2-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-associated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs7903146 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, we assigned cis-regulatory activity to approximately 30% (9/28) of constructs tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Notably, a subset of enhancers was active across multiple cell lines and overlapped with key epigenetic markers suggestive of cis-regulatory sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We further replicated the allelic-specific properties for SNP rs7903146 in pancreatic beta cells and additionally demonstrate identical allelic-specific enhancer effects in other cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results provide a detailed map of cis-regulatory elements within the TCF7L2 GWAS locus and support the hypothesis of cis-regulatory variation leading to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> predisposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The detection of allelic-specific effects for SNP rs7903146 in multiple cell lines further alludes to the likelihood of a peripheral defect in disease aetiology </plain></SENT>
