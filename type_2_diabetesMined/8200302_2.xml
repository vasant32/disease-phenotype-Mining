<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sequenced 536 basepairs in the 5'-upstream sequence of the gene of 35 Japanese with this disease and 3 patients with maturity-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the young </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The sequences corresponding to both alleles of the gene were identical to one another and to the sequence of subjects without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> except for one allelic variation of 'A' and 'C' at the position -230 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis by allele specific polymerase chain reaction revealed no significant difference in frequency of the variation at this position between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and type 2 diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the 5' region of the IAPP gene is highly conserved and only 1 DNA polymorphism is detected and that this polymorphism does not associate with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
