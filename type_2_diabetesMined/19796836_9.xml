<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective observational cohort studies of primary care-based <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> register were carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Risk of total and cardiovascular (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) mortality was evaluated in cohort of T2D patients that were treated with either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> (n=50,341), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> (n=2479) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi> (n=11,368) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cox regression was used for multifactor evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A cross-sectional evaluation of oral anti-diabetic drug (OAD) structure for 2005 and 2007 was also performed, as well as age at the time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was compared in the timeframe between 2002 and 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Total mortality was lower for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi>, vs. <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> cohort: HRs 0.33 (95% CI 0.26-0.41), p&lt;0.001 and 0.605 (95% CI 0.413-0.886), p&lt;0.01 respectively </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">Glibenclamide</z:chebi> prescriptions had changed from 64.0% (95% CI 63.5-64.5) to 59.5% (95% CI 9.7-10.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Age at the time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> for OAD-treated patients increased by 6.27 (95% CI 3.67-8.87)yrs, p&lt;0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">Glibenclamide</z:chebi> treatment of T2D is associated with greater risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality, vs. <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> treatment, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> mortality, vs. <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
