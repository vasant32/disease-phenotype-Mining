<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to study circulating levels of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, proinsulin, insulin, C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, glucagon, glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1), glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-2 (GLP-2) and gastric inhibitory <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (GIP) among individuals carrying the high-risk rs7903146 TT genotype and low-risk CC genotype following a meal test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A meal challenge was performed in 31 glucose-tolerant men (age 54 ± 7 years and BMI 26 ± 3 kg/m²) with rs7903146 TT genotype and 31 glucose-tolerant age- and BMI-matched men with CC genotype (age 53 ± 6 years and BMI 26 ± 3 kg/m²) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum proinsulin, insulin, C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> and plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, glucagon, GLP-1, GLP-2 and GIP were obtained 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, 120, 135, 150, 180, 210, and 240 min after ingestion of a standardised breakfast meal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An elevated incremental AUC for plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was observed among TT genotype carriers (CC carriers 21.8 ± 101.9 mmol/l × min vs TT carriers 97.9 ± 89.2 mmol/l × min, p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TT carriers also had increased AUCs for proinsulin (CC carriers 6,030 ± 3,001 pmol/l × min vs TT carriers 6,917 ± 4,820 pmol/l × min, p = 0.03), C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (CC carriers 397.6 ± 131.9 nmol/l × min vs TT carriers 417.1 ± 109.3 nmol/l × min, p = 0.04) and GIP (CC carriers 12,310 ± 3,840 pmol/l × min vs TT carriers 14,590 ± 5,910 pmol/l × min, p = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Middle-aged normoglycaemic individuals carrying the rs7903146 TCF7L2 risk TT genotype show early signs of dysregulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism, decreased processing of proinsulin and elevated GIP secretion following a meal challenge </plain></SENT>
