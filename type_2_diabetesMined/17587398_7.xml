<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To evaluate the efficacy of nateglinide vs. repaglinide in blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (BG) control and the effect on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and beta-Cell function in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A randomized controlled double-blind and double-dummy multicentre clinical trial was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 230 Chinese patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were enrolled in five clinical centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided randomly into group A [repaglinide 1.0 mg three times daily (t.i.d.), n = 115] or group B (nateglinide 90 mg t.i.d., n = 115) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At baseline and end of the 12-week clinical trial, standard mixed meal tolerance tests were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 223 patients (96.9%) completed the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between repaglinide and nateglinide groups in the effects of reducing fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FBG), 30-, 60- and 120-min BG during 12 weeks (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At week 12, no significant difference was shown between the two groups in BG or <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c) (HbA(1c)) (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the effect on HbA(1c) in repaglinide group was stronger than that in nateglinide group (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After 12-week treatment, area under the curve (AUC) of BG decreased (p &lt; 0.05), and AUC of insulin and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (CP) increased in both groups (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The effects of nateglinide on AUC of BG, insulin and CP were similar to that of repaglinide (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between the two groups in AUC of BG, insulin or CP in week 12 (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-IR) and beta-cell function indexes measured by HOMA-beta, DeltaI(30)/DeltaG(30) and (DeltaI(30)/DeltaG(30))/HOMA-IR were improved significantly in both groups during 12 weeks (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The effects of improving HOMA-IR and beta-cell function indexes in nateglinide group were comparable with that of repaglinide group (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of repaglinide and nateglinide in FBG, postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excursion and early-phase insulin secretion is similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>But the effect of repaglinide 1.0 mg t.i.d. on HbA(1c) is stronger than that of nateglinide 90 mg t.i.d. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This trial had shown that nateglinide and repaglinide could comparably improve insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function </plain></SENT>
