<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> took part in one of two large-scale, 2-year clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One study compared <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> treatment as add-on to failing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> therapy (N=317) with add-on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi> treatment to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (N=313) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The other study compared combination therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> added to existing failing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> therapy (N=319) with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> treatment in addition to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> (N=320) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HbA(1c) and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations were measured at baseline and throughout the study and at the final visit at week 104 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At selected centers (N=299 patients), a 3-h OGTT was performed at baseline and at week 104 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At week 104, mean HbA(1c) reduction from baseline was 0.89% for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> and 0.77% for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi> addition to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (p=0.200) and 1.03% with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> and 1.16% with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> addition to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> (p=0.173) in the total patient cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the 299 patients who underwent OGTT, 2 years of treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>, whether added to existing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> medication, resulted in decreases in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excursions after an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> load without increasing post-load serum insulin concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi> in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> therapy caused increases in both post-load serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin excursions after 2 years, whereas <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> add-on to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> did not have a significant effect on post-load serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations and resulted in an increase in insulin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There were no significant differences in HbA(1c) levels between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, 2-year treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> as an add-on to either failing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> therapy improved post-load <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excursions without affecting insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excursions were not improved by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> add-on therapy, despite increases in post-load insulin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> reduces peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> via mechanisms different from those of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
