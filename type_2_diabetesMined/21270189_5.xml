<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess change in patient-reported outcomes in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treated with exenatide once weekly compared with those treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this 26-week randomized, multicenter, double-dummy study, 491 subjects received 2 mg of exenatide once weekly or maximum daily doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> (100 mg) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (45 mg) on a background of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Weight-related quality of life, health utility, psychological well-being, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treatment satisfaction were assessed at baseline and week 26 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean group changes from baseline to week 26 were estimated by ANCOVA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Weight-related quality of life total scores improved significantly in the exenatide once weekly and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> arms only; the exenatide once weekly group experienced significantly greater improvement than the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> group in weight-related quality of life total scores and in several domain scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Health utility scores improved significantly for exenatide once weekly and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> groups (P &lt; 0.05) with no significant difference between the exenatide once weekly group and either comparison group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> groups experienced significant improvements on the psychological well-being global scale and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six domain scores, with no significant difference between the exenatide once weekly group and either comparator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> groups experienced significant improvements in total <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treatment satisfaction scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The exenatide once weekly group experienced greater improvement than the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> group in treatment satisfaction total scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In combination with clinical outcomes from this study, these results indicate it is possible for patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> to initiate exenatide therapy with potential benefits in both clinical and patient-reported outcomes </plain></SENT>
