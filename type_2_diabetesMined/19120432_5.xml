<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of insulin aspart (IAsp) were studied in elderly patients to examine the potential for postprandial dosing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nineteen type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> subjects, aged &gt; or =65 years, were enrolled in this randomized, double-blind, crossover trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects received 0.3 U/kg IAsp or regular human insulin during a <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> clamp procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IAsp showed a faster <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of action with significantly higher values for area under the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion rate curves, AUC(GIR(0-120 min)) and AUC(GIR(0-300 min)) (p = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Maximum metabolic activity was higher (4.4 vs. 3.8 mg/kg/min, p = 0.0039) and occurred earlier with IAsp (196 vs. 278 min, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Late metabolic activity (AUC(GIR (300-600 min))) was significantly lower with IAsp (p = 0.0006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Clinical studies are required to confirm whether postprandial administration of IAsp is appropriate for elderly patients </plain></SENT>
