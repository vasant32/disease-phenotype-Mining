<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Multicentre, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of 52-week treatment with vildagliptin (50 mg q.d.) in 306 drug-naïve patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (A1C = 6.2-7.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A1C, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) and measures of prandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control and beta-cell function determined during standard meal tests were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Baseline A1C and FPG averaged 6.7% and 7.1 mmol/l, respectively, in patients randomized to vildagliptin (n = 156) and 6.8% and 7.2 mmol/l in those randomized to placebo (n = 150) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A1C decreased modestly in vildagliptin-treated patients (Delta = -0.2 +/- 0.1%) and increased in patients receiving placebo (Delta = 0.1 +/- 0.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The between-group difference (vildagliptin - placebo) in adjusted mean change (AM Delta) in A1C was -0.3 +/- 0.1% (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FPG increased in patients receiving placebo (Delta = 0.5 +/- 0.1 mmol/l) and to a significantly lesser extent in vildagliptin-treated patients (between-group difference in AM Delta FPG = -0.4 +/- 0.2 mmol/l, p = 0.032) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Relative to placebo, 2-h postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi>) decreased (-0.9 +/- 0.4 mmol/l, p = 0.012), and insulin secretory rate (ISR) relative to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> [ISR area under the curve (AUC)(0-2) (h)/<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> AUC(0-2) (h)] increased (+5.0 +/- 1.2 pmol/min/m(2)/mM, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean body weight decreased by 0.5 +/- 0.3 kg in vildagliptin-treated patients and by 0.2 +/- 0.3 kg in patients receiving placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The side-effect profile of vildagliptin was similar to that of placebo, and one <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0745153" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemic episode</z:e> occurred in one patient receiving placebo </plain></SENT>
