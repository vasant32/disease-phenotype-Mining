<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Insulin is secreted as discrete insulin secretory bursts at ~5-min intervals into the hepatic portal vein, these pulses being attenuated early in the development of type 1 and type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intraportal insulin infusions (pulsatile, constant, or reproducing that in T2DM) indicated that the pattern of pulsatile insulin secretion delivered via the portal vein is important for hepatic insulin action and, therefore, presumably for hepatic insulin signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To test this, we examined hepatic insulin signaling in rat livers exposed to the same three patterns of portal vein insulin delivery by use of sequential liver biopsies in anesthetized rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intraportal delivery of insulin in a constant versus pulsatile pattern led to delayed and impaired activation of hepatic insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 and IRS-2 signaling, impaired activation of downstream insulin signaling effector molecules AKT and Foxo1, and decreased expression of glucokinase (Gck) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We further established that hepatic Gck expression is decreased in the HIP rat model of T2DM, a defect that correlated with a progressive defect of pulsatile insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the physiological pulsatile pattern of insulin delivery is important in hepatic insulin signaling and glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hepatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is likely in part due to impaired pulsatile insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
