<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Between 1992 and 2004, 38,716 apparently healthy U.S. women aged &gt;or=45 years and free of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> were in two randomly assigned intervention groups and received 600 IU of vitamin E (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="22470">alpha-tocopherol</z:chebi>, n = 19,347) or placebo (n = 19,369) on alternate days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During a median 10-year follow-up, there were 827 cases of incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the vitamin E group and 869 in the placebo group, a nonsignificant 5% risk reduction (relative risk [RR] 0.95 [95% CI 0.87-1.05], P = 0.31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence that <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk factors including age, BMI, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin use, physical activity, alcohol intake, and smoking status modified the effect of vitamin E on the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a sensitivity analysis taking compliance into account, women in the vitamin E group had an RR of 0.93 (95% CI 0.83-1.04) (P = 0.21) compared with those randomized to placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this large trial with 10-year follow-up, alternate-day doses of 600 IU vitamin E provided no significant benefit for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in initially healthy women </plain></SENT>
