<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Serum levels of AGEs were determined by immunoassay in a random sample of 874 Finnish diabetic study participants (488 men, 386 women), aged 45-64 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These participants were followed for 18 years for total, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> and CHD mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Multivariate Cox regression models revealed that serum levels of AGEs were significantly associated with total (p = 0.002) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> mortality (p = 0.021) in women, but not in men </plain></SENT>
