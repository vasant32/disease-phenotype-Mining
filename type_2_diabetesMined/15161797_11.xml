<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study population, 131 Hispanic overweight children (mean BMI percentile 97.0 +/- 3.1, 72 boys, 59 girls, ages 8-13 years, mean Tanner stage 2.4 +/- 1.5) with a family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, underwent a physical examination of the neck to determine AN absence or presence (0-1), AN extent score (0-4 scale), AN texture score (0-3 scale), and an AN combined score (extent + texture; 0-7 scale) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>S(i) was measured by the frequently sampled intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test and minimal modeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariate linear regression analysis was used to determine the role of BMI and AN in predicting S(i) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BMI was the main predictor of S(i), explaining approximately 41% of the variance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of AN explained an additional 4% of the variability in S(i); scale scoring of AN extent or texture did not significantly improve the prediction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although AN is an independent risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in overweight Hispanic children at risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, body <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> is the primary determinant of insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, scale scoring AN seems of minimal usefulness in clinically estimating the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> over and above assessing the presence or absence of AN and calculating BMI </plain></SENT>
