<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Common and rare variants of the hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha (HNF4A) gene have been associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and related traits in several populations suggesting the involvement of this transcription factor in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within a large haplotype block surrounding the alternate P2 promoter, located approximately 45 kb upstream from the coding region, have been investigated in several populations of varying ethnicity with inconsistent results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Additionally, SNPs located within the P1 promoter and coding region have also been inconsistently associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Characterization of variation across this gene region in Mexican-American populations has not been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We therefore examined polymorphisms across the HNF4A gene in a cohort of Mexican-American pedigrees and assessed their association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We observed evidence for association of SNPs in the P2 promoter region with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P = 0.003) and its age at diagnosis (P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The risk allele frequency (53%) was intermediate to that reported in Caucasian populations (20-27%) and Pima Indians (83%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No other SNPs were associated with either trait </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results support the possibility that a variant in the P2 promoter region of HNF4A, or variants in linkage disequilibrium within this region, contributes to susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in many ethnic populations including Mexican Americans </plain></SENT>
