<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effects of these compounds were investigated in diabetic db/db mice, insulin-resistant diet-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (DIO) mice, and rats with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> (STZ)-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MTZ reduced fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and HbA(1c) levels in db/db mice, <z:mp ids='MP_0005292'>improved glucose tolerance</z:mp> in DIO mice, and enhanced the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering effects of exogenous insulin administration in rats with STZ-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps in DIO mice revealed that MTZ increased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion rate and suppressed endogenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Whole-body or cellular oxygen consumption rate was not altered, suggesting MTZ may inhibit <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production by different mechanism(s) to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In support of this, MTZ enhanced the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> in db/db mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MTZ is known to be a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23018">carbonic anhydrase inhibitor</z:chebi> (CAI); however, CAIs <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi>, ethoxyzolamide, dichlorphenamide, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3654">chlorthalidone</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47426">furosemide</z:chebi> were not effective in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that MTZ acts as an insulin sensitizer that suppresses hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> effect of MTZ does not appear to be a function of its known activity as a CAI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The additive <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering effect of MTZ together with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> highlights the potential utility for the management of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
