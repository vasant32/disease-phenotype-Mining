<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to study the associations of childhood lifestyle factors (the frequency of consumption of vegetables, fruit, fish, and meat, butter use on bread, and physical activity) with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> (MetS) in adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study cohort consisted of 2,128 individuals, 3-18 years of age at the baseline, with a follow-up time of 27 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used the average of lifestyle factor measurements taken in 1980, 1983, and 1986 in the analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Childhood dietary factors and physical activity were assessed by self-reported questionnaires, and a harmonized definition of MetS was used as the adult outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Childhood vegetable consumption frequency was inversely associated with adult MetS (odds ratio [OR] 0.86 [95% CI 0.77-0.97], P = 0.02) in a multivariable analysis adjusted with age, sex, childhood metabolic risk factors (<z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, systolic blood pressure, insulin, BMI, and C-reactive protein), family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and socioeconomic status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The association remained even after adjustment for adulthood vegetable consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Associations with the other childhood lifestyle factors were not found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the individual components of MetS, decreased frequency of childhood vegetable consumption predicted <z:mp ids='MP_0002842'>high blood pressure</z:mp> (0.88 [0.80-0.98], P = 0.01) and a high <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> value (0.88 [0.79-0.99], P = 0.03) after adjustment for the above-mentioned risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Childhood vegetable consumption frequency is inversely associated with MetS in adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that a higher intake of vegetables in childhood may have a protective effect on MetS in adulthood </plain></SENT>
