<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is widely recognized that the current environment (e.g. an unhealthy diet and sedentary lifestyle) contributes to this process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In recent years, however, the role of the early environment, particularly nutrition, has emerged as an important factor capable of influencing health and disease risk of an individual, including risk of T2D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The impact of early environment on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism has been extensively studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compelling evidence from epidemiological studies and animal models suggests that early nutrition can affect insulin action as a mediator of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis in peripheral tissues and as an important regulator of appetite and body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The early environment can also affect β-cell mass and function, and hence insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The molecular mechanisms underlying the relationship between a suboptimal early environment and impaired insulin action and secretion is thought to include epigenetic modifications of the foetal genome, <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction </plain></SENT>
