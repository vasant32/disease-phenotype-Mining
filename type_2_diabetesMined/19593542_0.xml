<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: KK Cg-Ay/J mice, aged 12 to 14 weeks, underwent an initial intraperitoneal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GTT</z:e>) and were divided into the following groups: KK control group, basal medium (M199) only; KK myoblast group, with hSkM transplantation; KK fibroblast group, with human fibroblast transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Non-diabetic C57BL mice were used as an additional <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control and also had hSkM transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cells were transplanted intra-muscularly into the skeletal muscles of the mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">ciclosporin</z:chebi> for 6 weeks only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HbA(1c) and fasting <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GTT</z:e>, as well as serum adiponectin, cholesterol, insulin and triacylglycerol were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry studies showed extensive survival of the transplanted hSkMs in the skeletal muscles at 12 weeks, with nuclei of the hSkMs integrated into the host muscle fibres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Repeat <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GTT</z:e> showed a significant decrease in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations in the KK myoblast group compared with the KK control and KK fibroblast groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The KK myoblast group also had reduced mean HbA(1c), cholesterol, insulin and triacylglycerol, and increased adiponectin compared with the KK control and KK fibroblast groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>C57BL mice showed no change in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis after hSkM transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Human skeletal myoblast transplantation attenuated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020459" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperinsulinaemia</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005292'>improved glucose tolerance</z:mp> in the KK mouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This novel approach of improving muscle <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> may be a potential alternative treatment for type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
