<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Physicians' Routine Evaluation of Safety and Efficacy of NovoMix 0 Therapy Korea study was a 6-month, prospective, observational study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No study-specific interventions were involved except the collection of data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> not adequately controlled on their previous therapy, and who were prescribed BIAsp30 as monotherapy, or in combination with oral hypoglycaemic agents, were eligible for the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This subgroup analysis was based on the outcomes in patients &gt; or years (n = 1720) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BIAsp30 treatment was associated with significant mean reductions in <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and post-prandial plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels of 1.2 +/- 1.6%, 2.3 +/- 3.5 mmol/l and 4.8 +/- 5.3 mmol/l at 6 months (p &lt; 0.0001 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>), from baseline levels of 9.1 +/- 1.7%, 10.7 +/- 3.4 mmol/l and 16.7 +/- 5.0 mmol/l, respectively </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The proportion of patients reporting adverse drug reactions was low (0.3 and 0.1% at 3 and 6 months, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Body <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> was mild at &lt;0.1 kg at 3 months, and 0.3 kg at 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As compared to the previous treatment, &gt;80% of patients were rated as being either 'very satisfied' or 'satisfied' with BIAsp30 treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this subanalysis of Korean elderly patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> inadequately controlled on their previous therapies, treatment with BIAsp30 offered improvements in glycaemic control and was well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Body <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> was minimal with BIAsp30, and treatment satisfaction among these patients appeared to be high </plain></SENT>
