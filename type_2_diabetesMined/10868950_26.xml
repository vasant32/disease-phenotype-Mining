<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ATP-sensitive K+ channels (K(ATP) channels) are present in many cells and regulate a variety of cellular functions by coupling cell metabolism with membrane potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The activity of the K(ATP) channels in pancreatic beta-cells is regulated by changes in the ATP and <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> concentrations (ATP/<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> ratio) caused by <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, the K(ATP) channels are the ATP and <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> sensors in the regulation of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>K(ATP) channels are also the target of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi>, which are widely used in the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Molecular cloning of the two subunits of the pancreatic beta-cell K(ATP) channel, Kir6.2 (an inward rectifier K+ channel member) and SUR1 (a receptor for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi>), has provided great insight into its structure and function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Kir6.2 subunits form the K+ ion-permeable pore and primarily confer inhibition of the channels by ATP, while SUR1 subunits confer activation of the channels by MgADP and K+ channel openers, such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4495">diazoxide</z:chebi>, as well as inhibition by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The SUR1 subunits also enhance the sensitivity of the channels to ATP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To determine the physiological roles of K(ATP) channels directly, we have generated two kinds of genetically engineered mice: mice expressing a dominant-negative form of Kir6.2 specifically in the pancreatic beta-cells (Kir6.2G132S Tg mice) and mice lacking Kir6.2 (Kir6.2 knockout mice) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Studies of these mice elucidated various roles of the K(ATP) channels in <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> pancreatic function: 1) the K(ATP) channels are the major determinant of the resting membrane potential of pancreatic beta-cells, 2) both <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>- and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi>-induced membrane depolarization of beta-cells require closure of the K(ATP) channels, 3) both <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>- and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi>-induced rises in intracellular calcium concentration in beta-cells require closure of the K(ATP) channels, 4) both <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>- and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi>-induced insulin secretions are mediated principally by the K(ATP) channel-dependent pathway, 5) the K(ATP) channels are important for beta-cell survival and architecture of the islets, 6) the K(ATP) channels are important in the differentiation of islet cells, and 7) the K(ATP) channels in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-responsive cells generally participate in coupling <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> sensing with cell excitability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, despite the severe defect in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced insulin secretion, Kir6.2 knockout mice show only a very mild impairment in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, when the knockout mice become <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> with age, they develop fasting <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo>, while neither fasting <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> nor <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> is evident in the aged knockout mice without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, suggesting that both the genetic defect in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced insulin secretion and the acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> due to environmental factors are necessary to develop <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Kir6.2 knockout mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, Kir6.2G132S Tg mice and Kir6.2 knockout mice provide a model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and clarify the various roles of K(ATP) channels in <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> pancreatic function </plain></SENT>
