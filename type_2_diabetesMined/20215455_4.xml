<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Risks of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> are elevated worldwide in Indian Asians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, risks of other <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related complications, i.e., foot ulceration and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath>, also with a vascular basis, are substantially lower in Asians than in white Europeans in the U.K., possibly due to less <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore compared signs, symptoms, and objective quantitative measures of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011882" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic neuropathy</z:e> and their risk factors in Indian Asians and Europeans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of a population-based sample of age- and sex-matched adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> of European (95 male and 85 female) and Asian (96 male and 84 female) descent in the U.K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were assessed for neuropathic symptoms, signs, nerve conduction, autonomic function, and quantitative sensory testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Peripheral vascular function and other potential risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS Mean nerve conduction velocity Z scores were better in Asians (mean +/- SD 0.07 +/- 0.62) than in Europeans (-0.11 +/- 0.60; P = 0.007) and were explained by the shorter height, fewer pack-years smoked, and higher transcutaneous oxygen levels (TCpO(2)) in Indian Asians (P value for ethnic comparison attenuated to 0.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Small fiber <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> was less prevalent in Indian Asians compared with Europeans (odds ratio 0.58 [95% CI 0.37-0.93]; P = 0.02) and was primarily accounted for by better TCpO(2) (0.70 [0.40-1.21]; P = 0.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Asians with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have substantially less large and small fiber <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> than Europeans, despite comparable traditional risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Independent from smoking, the lower risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> in Asians is due to better skin microvascularization and may help explain the substantially reduced Asian foot <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> risk </plain></SENT>
