<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aims to identify the molecular mechanism by which DIO-triggered endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress promotes hepatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in mouse models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: C57BL/6 mice and primary hepatocytes were used to evaluate the role of LIPIN2 in ER stress-induced hepatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tunicamycin, thapsigargin, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> were used to invoke <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ER stress conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To promote <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> ER stress, mice were fed with a high-fat diet for 8-12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To verify the role of LIPIN2 in hepatic insulin signaling, adenoviruses expressing <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> or mutant LIPIN2, and shRNA for LIPIN2 were used in animal studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin levels as well as hepatic free fatty acids, diacylglycerol (DAG), and triacylglycerol were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, insulin tolerance, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> tolerance tests were performed to evaluate the metabolic phenotype of these mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: LIPIN2 expression was enhanced in mouse livers by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ER stress-inducers or by high-fat feeding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Transcriptional activation of LIPIN2 by ER stress is mediated by activating transcription factor 4, as demonstrated by LIPIN2 promoter assays, Western blot analyses, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Knockdown of hepatic LIPIN2 in DIO mice reduced fasting <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> and improved hepatic insulin signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Conversely, overexpression of LIPIN2 impaired hepatic insulin signaling in a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16337">phosphatidic acid</z:chebi> phosphatase activity-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that ER stress-induced LIPIN2 would contribute to the perturbation of hepatic insulin signaling via a DAG-protein kinase C Îµ-dependent manner in DIO mice </plain></SENT>
