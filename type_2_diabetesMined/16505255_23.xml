<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two adiponectin receptors have been identified, and we investigated whether sequence variations in adiponectin receptor 1 (ADIPOR1) and adiponectin receptor 2 (ADIPOR2) genes could contribute to the genetic risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a case-control study of 1,498 Caucasian subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sequenced the putative functional regions of the two genes in 48 subjects and selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the public database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five SNPs in ADIPOR1 and 12 in ADIPOR2 were tested for association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No SNP of ADIPOR1 showed association in any of the samples from the French population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, three SNPs of ADIPOR2 showed nominal evidence for association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> before correction for multiple testing (odds ratio [OR] 1.29-1.37, P = 0.034-0.014); only rs767870, located in intron 6, was replicated in an additional <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> dataset (n = 636, OR 1.29, P = 0.020) with significant allelic association from the overall meta-analysis of 2,876 subjects (adjusted OR 1.25 [95% CI 1.07-1.45], P = 0.0051) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our data suggest a modest contribution of ADIPOR2 variants in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk in the French population </plain></SENT>
