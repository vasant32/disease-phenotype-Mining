<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> sleep insufficiency on insulin secretion and action in populations at high risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examined the relationship between objectively documented habitual sleep curtailment and measures of insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, and oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance in free-living adults with parental history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 47 healthy participants with parental history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (26 female/21 male, mean [SD] age 26 [4] years and BMI 23.8 [2.5] kg/m(2)) completed 13 (SD = 2) days of sleep and physical activity monitoring by wrist actigraphy and waist accelerometry while following their usual lifestyle at home </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Laboratory polysomnography was used to screen for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0851578,C0852564" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">sleep disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Indices of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk based on oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests were compared between participants with habitual short sleep and those with usual sleep duration &gt;6 h/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Consistent with a behavioral pattern of habitual sleep curtailment, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751509" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">short sleepers</z:e> obtained an average of 1.5 h less sleep per night and showed signs of increased sleep pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Participants who habitually curtailed their sleep had considerably higher indices of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003058'>increased insulin secretion</z:mp> but maintained <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance similar to that of subjects who slept more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Young lean adults with parental history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who habitually curtail their sleep have increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and compensatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo>--a pattern that has been associated with higher risk of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in such susceptible individuals </plain></SENT>
