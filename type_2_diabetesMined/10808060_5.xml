<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>First, incidence and severity of diabetic micro- and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096293" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">macroangiopathies</z:e> were progressively increased with the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001928'>coagulation abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Next, correlation of the four values with the presence of micro- and macrovascular complications, respectively, was analyzed by the multiple logistic regression analysis, with the inclusion of other variables such as age, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, HbA1c, blood pressure, and urinary albumin excretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microangiopathies</z:e>, F1+2 and systolic blood pressure were significantly related, with the relationship being very strong for the former (P=0.003) and weak for the latter (P=0.035) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other clinical variables were not significantly related with the presence of complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Coagulation and fibrinolytic abnormalities are stronger determinants of the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011875" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic vascular complications</z:e> than other clinical variables including the degree of glycemia, in stable, relatively well controlled patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
