<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adiponectin is an adipose-specific plasma protein that possesses anti-atherogenic properties, such as the suppression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule expression in vascular endothelial cells and cytokine production from macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasma adiponectin concentrations are decreased in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and type 2 diabetic subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A regimen that normalizes or increases the plasma adiponectin might prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, we demonstrate the inducing effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> (TZDs), which are synthetic PPARgamma ligands, on the expression and secretion of adiponectin in humans and rodents in vivo and in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The administration of TZDs significantly increased the plasma adiponectin concentrations in insulin resistant humans and rodents without affecting their body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adiponectin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was normalized or increased by TZDs in the adipose tissues of <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes, TZD derivatives enhanced the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression and secretion of adiponectin in a dose- and time-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, these effects were mediated through the activation of the promoter by the TZDs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, TNF-alpha, which is produced more in an insulin-resistant condition, dose-dependently reduced the expression of adiponectin in adipocytes by suppressing its promoter activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>TZDs restored this inhibitory effect by TNF-alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>TZDs might prevent atherosclerotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> in insulin-resistant patients by inducing the production of adiponectin through direct effect on its promoter and antagonizing the effect of TNF-alpha on the adiponectin promoter </plain></SENT>
