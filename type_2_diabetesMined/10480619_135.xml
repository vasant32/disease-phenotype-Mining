<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about changes in vascular reactivity in those at risk for developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To address this situation, the vascular reactivity in both the micro- and macrocirculation was studied in four age and sex comparable groups: 30 healthy normoglycemic subjects with no history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a first-degree relative (controls), 39 healthy normoglycemic subjects with a history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in one or both parents (relatives), 32 subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT), and 42 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> without vascular complications (<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Laser Doppler perfusion imaging was used to measure vasodilation in the forearm skin in response to iontophoresis of 1% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2417">acetylcholine chloride</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="93" ids="22614">Ach</z:chebi>) (endothelium-dependent) and 1% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi> (SNP) (endothelium-independent), whereas high-resolution ultrasound images were used to measure brachial artery diameter changes during reactive hyperemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma concentrations of endothelin-1 (ET-1), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor (vWF), soluble intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule (sICAM), and soluble vascular cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule (sVCAM) were also measured as indicators of endothelial cell activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The vasodilatory responses to <z:chebi fb="93" ids="22614">Ach</z:chebi>, expressed as percent increase of blood flow over baseline, were reduced in relatives (98 +/- 48, mean +/- SD), IGT (94 +/- 52), and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (74 +/- 45) compared with controls (126 +/- 67) (P &lt; 0.001 controls versus relatives, IGT, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The responses to SNP were similarly reduced: controls (123 +/- 46), relatives (85 +/- 46), IGT (83 +/- 48), and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (65 +/- 31) (P &lt; 0.001 controls versus relatives, IGT, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) as were the responses in the brachial artery diameter during reactive hyperemia: controls (13.7 +/- 6.1), relatives (10.5 +/- 6.7), IGT (9.8 +/- 4.5), and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (8.4 +/- 5.0) (P &lt; 0.01 controls versus relatives, IGT, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Women had greater responses than men in both the micro- and macrovascular circulatory tests, but a similar progressive reduction was observed in both sexes with increasing degrees of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A significant inverse correlation was found between microvascular reactivity and systolic blood pressure, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, fasting plasma insulin, and homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) values, an index of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>BMI and diastolic blood pressure had a significant inverse correlation only with endothelium-dependent vasodilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the macrocirculation, systolic blood pressure, HbA1c, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, and HOMA had significant correlation with brachial artery diameter changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Compared with control subjects, ET-1 was significantly higher in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups, vWF was higher only in the diabetic group, sICAM levels were higher in the IGT and diabetic groups, while sVCAM concentrations were higher in the relatives and those with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>On stepwise multivariate analysis, age, sex, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and BMI were the most important contributing factors to the variation of vascular reactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Addition of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> clinical and biochemical measures explained only 32-37% of the variation in vascular reactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that abnormalities in vascular reactivity and biochemical markers of endothelial cell activation are present early in individuals at risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, even at a stage when <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance exists, and that factors in addition to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> may be operative </plain></SENT>
