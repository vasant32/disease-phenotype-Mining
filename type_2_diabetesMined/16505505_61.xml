<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this 24-week multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel trial, 217 patients (HbA(1c) [A1C] 7.5-11%, BMI &gt;25 kg/m(2)) on &gt; or =50% of maximal-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> received add-on insulin glargine 10 units/day or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> 4 mg/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Insulin glargine was forced-titrated to target fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) &lt; or =5.5-6.7 mmol/l (&lt; or =100-120 mg/dl), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> was increased to 8 mg/day any time after 6 weeks if FPG was &gt;5.5 mmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A1C improvements from baseline were similar in both groups (-1.7 vs. -1.5% for insulin glargine vs. <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>, respectively); however, when baseline A1C was &gt;9.5%, the reduction of A1C with insulin glargine was greater than with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Insulin glargine yielded better FPG values than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> (-3.6 +/- 0.23 vs. -2.6 +/- 0.22 mmol/l; P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Insulin glargine final dose per day was 38 +/- 26 IU vs. 7.1 +/- 2 mg for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Confirmed hypoglycemic events at plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &lt;3.9 mmol/l (&lt;70 mg/dl) were slightly greater for the insulin glargine group (n = 57) than for the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> group (n = 47) (P = 0.0528) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The calculated average rate per patient-year of a confirmed hypoglycemic event (&lt;70 mg/dl), after adjusting for BMI, was 7.7 (95% CI 5.4-10.8) and 3.4 (2.3-5.0) for the insulin glargine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> groups, respectively (P = 0.0073) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>More patients in the insulin glargine group had confirmed nocturnal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> of &lt;3.9 mmol/l (P = 0.02) and &lt;2.8 mmol/l (P &lt; 0.05) than in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> was unchanged with insulin glargine but increased with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> by 4.4% (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Insulin glargine had less <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> (1.6 +/- 0.4 vs. 3.0 +/- 0.4 kg; P = 0.02), fewer adverse events (7 vs. 29%; P = 0.0001), and no peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> (0 vs. 12.5%) </plain></SENT>
