<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Insulin-naive adults (n=582, HbA(1c) 7.5-10.0%, BMI &lt;or= 40.0 kg/m(2)) were randomised 1:1 to receive insulin detemir or glargine once daily (evening) actively titrated to target fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) &lt;or= 6.0 mmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An additional morning insulin detemir dose was permitted if pre-dinner plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (PG) was &gt;7.0 mmol/l after achieving FPG &lt;7.0 mmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Due to labelling restrictions, no second glargine dose was allowed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Baseline HbA(1c) decreased from 8.6 to 7.2 and 7.1% (NS) with detemir and glargine, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FPG improved from 10.8 to 7.1 and 7.0 mmol/l (NS), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With detemir, 45% of participants completed the study on once daily dosing and 55% on twice daily dosing, with no difference in HbA(1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, 52% of participants achieved HbA(1c) &lt;or= 7.0%: 33% (detemir) and 35% (glargine) without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Within-participant variability for self-monitored FPG and pre-dinner PG did not differ by insulin treatment, nor did the relative risk of overall or nocturnal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Modest reductions in <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> were seen with detemir vs glargine in completers (3.0 vs 3.9 kg, p=0.01) and in the intention-to-treat population (2.7 vs 3.5 kg, p=0.03), primarily related to completers on once-daily detemir </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean daily detemir dose was higher (0.78 U/kg [0.52 with once daily dosing, 1.00 U/kg with twice daily dosing]) than glargine (0.44 IU/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Injection site reactions were more frequent with detemir (4.5 vs 1.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Supplementation of oral agents with detemir or glargine achieves clinically important improvements in glycaemic control with low risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Non-inferiority was demonstrated for detemir using higher insulin doses (mainly patients on twice daily dosing); <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> was somewhat reduced with once daily insulin detemir </plain></SENT>
