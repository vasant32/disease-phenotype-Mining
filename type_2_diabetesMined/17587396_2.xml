<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this pilot, prospective study was to examine the hypothesis that the efficacy of TZDs may vary depending on ethnicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This aim was achieved by comparing the effects of 6-months treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (45 mg/day) on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control and metabolic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> in Caucasian and Maori-Polynesian patients with poorly controlled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety-seven patients (40 Caucasian and 57 Maori-Polynesian) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were selected for the study from our clinical databases if they were on the maximum tolerated dose of oral agents and had a <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c) (HbA(1c)) &gt; 8.0% for at least 2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (45 mg/day) for 6 months in addition to their regular <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical data and blood samples were collected at monthly intervals and the following indices measured: weight, blood pressure, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> score, HbA(1c), plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, alanine amino transferase and adiponectin levels and plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile, including <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>)-cholesterol particle size and atherogenic index of plasma (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIP</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The data of the 81 patients who finished the study were analysed using analysis of variance, chi-square analysis and multiple regression methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The absolute change from baseline in mean HbA(1c) (Caucasian -1.4% vs. Maori-Polynesian -1.3%) and fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels (Caucasian -2.1 mmol/l vs. Maori-Polynesian -2.8 mmol/l) was similar in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">Pioglitazone</z:chebi> caused an improvement in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile in both ethnic groups, with a reduction in mean values of atherogenic fractions (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>: Caucasian -0.5 mmol/l, p &lt; 0.001 vs. Maori-Polynesian -0.3 mmol/l, p = 0.05; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39027">very low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>)-cholesterol: Caucasian -0.11 mmol/l, p = 0.001 vs. Maori-Polynesian -0.04 mmol/l, p = 0.85; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47776">VLDL-triglyceride</z:chebi>: Caucasian -0.36 mmol/l, p &lt; 0.001 vs. Maori-Polynesian -0.22 mmol/l, p = 0.14; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B: Caucasian -0.09 mmol/l, p = 0.03 vs. Maori-Polynesian -0.08 mmol/l, p = 0.18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These changes were associated with an increase in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> particle size (Caucasian +0.23 nm, p = 0.05 vs. Maori-Polynesian +0.26 nm, p = 0.04) and a decrease in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIP</z:e> (Caucasian -0.14, p &lt; 0.001 vs. Maori-Polynesian -0.08, p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>While the changes in the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> indices tended to be greater in the Caucasian group, the difference in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> response between the two ethnic groups was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Multiple regression analyses showed that the baseline value of the individual <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> fractions was the main determinant of the changes in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> has similar beneficial effects on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control and plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile in Caucasian and Maori-Polynesian patients with poorly controlled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our data showed that while the improvement in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile was more pronounced in Caucasian patients than in Maori-Polynesian patients, this difference was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
