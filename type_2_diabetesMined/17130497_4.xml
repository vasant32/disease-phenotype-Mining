<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, in a specifically designed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> model, we couple separate gene loci to mechanisms of beta-cell pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Niddm1i is a major <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-controlling 16-Mb region in the diabetic GK rat that causes defective insulin secretion and corresponds to loci in humans and mice associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Generation of a series of congenic rat strains harboring different parts of GK-derived Niddm1i enabled fine mapping of this locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Congenic strains carrying the GK genotype distally in Niddm1i displayed <z:mp ids='MP_0003059'>reduced insulin secretion</z:mp> in response to both <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and high <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi>, as well as decreased single-cell exocytosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By contrast, a strain carrying the GK genotype proximally in Niddm1i exhibited both intact insulin release in response to high <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> and intact single-cell exocytosis, but insulin secretion was suppressed when stimulated by <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Islets from this strain also failed to respond to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> by increasing the cellular ATP-to-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Changes in beta-cell mass did not contribute to the secretory defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the failure of insulin secretion in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> includes distinct functional defects in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism and insulin exocytosis of the beta-cell and that their genetic fundaments are encoded by different loci within Niddm1i </plain></SENT>
