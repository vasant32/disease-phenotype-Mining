<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Antiganglioside antibodies and point mutation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> DNA at position 3243 were not found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neuropathology of the sural nerve showed a moderate myelinated fiber loss, active <z:mp ids='MP_0005405'>axonal degeneration</z:mp>, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0003383'>onion-bulb formation</z:hpo>, endoneurial or epineurial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> were not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Electromyography revealed neurogenic changes in the proximal upper limb muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nerve conduction studies revealed mild bilateral slowing in nerve conduction velocity in both of the upper and lower limbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of this patients was suspected to be a proximal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011882" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic neuropathy</z:e> (diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003202'>amyotrophy</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
