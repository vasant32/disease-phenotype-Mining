<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A1C was &gt;or=9.5% among 50% of youth with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> aged &gt;or=15 years </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among African American youth aged 10-19 years, prevalence (per 1,000) of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 1.06 (0.93-1.22) and annual incidence (per 100,000) was 19.0 (16.9-21.3) </plain></SENT>
