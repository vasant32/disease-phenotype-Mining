<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study was aimed to characterize the vascular production of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> in Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rat, a model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9505">nitroblue tetrazolium</z:chebi> staining in the aorta from old (30 weeks) OLETF rat was more prominent than that of age-matched control (LETO) rat, which was significantly inhibited by diphenyleneiodonium (10 micromol/l), but not by inhibitors for other oxidases such as <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15318,17712">xanthine</z:chebi> oxidase, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> oxidase, nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase, and cyclooxygenase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the aorta from old OLETF rat with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, the enhanced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi> oxidase activity in association with upregulated expression of p22phox and gp91phox was observed, but not in both LETO and young (10 weeks) OLETF rats without <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there was a positive correlation (P&lt;0.01) between elevation of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level and increase in vascular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi> oxidase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on these results, it was suggested that the enhanced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi> oxidase activity in the aorta from OLETF rat occurred after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, thereby resulting in the increased vascular production of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
