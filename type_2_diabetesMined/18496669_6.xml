<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the predictive role and change in IGFBP-1 concentrations during development of abnormal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: IGFBP-1 levels were determined at baseline and at 10 years in an incident case-control prospective study of Swedish white men aged 35-56 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Individuals with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance at baseline who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001952'>abnormal glucose tolerance</z:hpo> during a 10 year period (n = 355) according to WHO criteria were pair-matched to controls for age and family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fasting IGFBP-1 concentrations were lower in individuals who later developed abnormal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> regulation and correlated inversely with fasting proinsulin values (r = -0.48; p &lt; 0.0001), and both were significant predictors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Individuals in the highest quartile at baseline for an algorithm incorporating fasting IGFBP-1, blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, proinsulin and waist and height had a 40-fold increased risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with the lowest quartile (95% CI 7.7-214) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IGFBP-1 increased 32% (95% CI 17-49%) during the 10 years in those developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and was increased in relation to insulin levels, suggesting the emergence of hepatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, elevated IGFBP-1 levels at follow-up were associated with higher 2 h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> values during an OGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Low IGFBP-1 predicts the development of abnormal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> regulation and, as an inhibitor of the insulin-like actions of insulin-like growth factors, elevated levels of IGFBP-1 after the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may also play a pathophysiological role </plain></SENT>
