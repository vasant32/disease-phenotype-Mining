<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: SWING was a prospective, observational study conducted in nine European countries primarily to assess direct treatment costs when switching from short-acting human insulins to rapid-acting insulin analogues (H-A) or vice versa (A-H) in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were collected at a baseline visit (time of switch) and at approximately 3, 6 and 12 months post-switch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, 2389 patients switched from H-A (n=2203) or A-H (n=186); another 603 were enrolled but ineligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean (SD) direct <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related costs (pro-rated to account for variable visit schedules) were €548.7 (865.8) 6 months prior to switch, €625.6 (1474.9) at 0-6 months and €568.6 (590.7) 6-12 months following switch for H-A, and €544.5 (421.0), €481.0 (301.5) and €461.6 (335.0) for A-H, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean (SD) HbA(1c) decreased over 12 months by 1.08 (1.53)% units H-A and 1.17 (1.45)% units A-H </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A small decline in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> occurred over time, but there were no clinically meaningful changes in mean PROs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There were small changes in mean direct <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related costs (following adjustment for time interval) in patients switching in either direction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Improvements in mean HbA(1c) and incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> cannot necessarily be attributed to therapeutic switch </plain></SENT>
