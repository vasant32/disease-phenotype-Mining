<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To investigate the association between an individual's ability to recognize his/her energy intake and energy expenditure with the status of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM) control, we conducted a cross-sectional study using data from 62 outpatients with type 2 DM (46 men and 16 women), aged 33-77 years, from two hospitals in Tokyo in 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A dietitian-interviewer asked the patients to estimate their probable energy intake and expenditure in recent days (self-estimated energy intake and expenditure, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, a dietary survey was conducted to estimate the patient's energy intake by a self-recorded method with a dietitian's interview for three continuous business days; the physical exercise levels were measured using a pedometer with multiple-memory accelerometers for one week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The percentage of subjects whose self-estimated energy intake was within +/-10% of the dietary survey-based energy intake became significantly lower as the control status worsened (35.6, 12.9, and 11.1% in the first, second, and third tertile groups of HbA(1c), respectively; P = 0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similar but non-significant results were observed for the energy expenditure (P = 0.35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since the control status of DM was worse among patients who could not recognize their amount of caloric intake and expenditure, a training program to improve such recognition ability may be needed </plain></SENT>
