<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>Oxidative stress</z:mp> is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and is thought to contribute to progression toward type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Oxidation induces cellular damages through increased amounts of reactive <z:chebi fb="5" ids="17478">aldehydes</z:chebi> from <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to investigate 1) the effect of the major <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation end product, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32585">4-hydroxynonenal</z:chebi> (HNE), on insulin signaling in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and 2) whether fatty <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17478">aldehyde</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (FALDH), which detoxifies HNE, protects cells and improves insulin action under <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: 3T3-L1 adipocytes were exposed to HNE and/or infected with control adenovirus or adenovirus expressing FALDH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with HNE at nontoxic concentrations leads to a pronounced decrease in insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1/-2 proteins and in insulin-induced IRS and insulin receptor beta (IR beta) tyrosine phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, we detect increased binding of HNE to IRS-1/-2-generating HNE-IRS adducts, which likely impair IRS function and favor their degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and protein kinase B activities are also downregulated upon HNE treatment, resulting in blunted metabolic responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, FALDH, by reducing adduct formation, partially restores HNE-generated decrease in insulin-induced IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and metabolic responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> could have an <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> effect because it blocks the noxious HNE action on IRS-1 by increasing FALDH gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Collectively, our data show that FALDH improves insulin action in HNE-treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>Oxidative stress</z:mp> induced by reactive <z:chebi fb="5" ids="17478">aldehydes</z:chebi>, such as HNE, is implicated in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, which is alleviated by FALDH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Hence, detoxifying enzymes could play a crucial role in blocking progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
