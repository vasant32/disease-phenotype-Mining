<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001622'>Premature birth</z:hpo> is also associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, but studies conducted so far have not provided follow-up into adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the effects of (1) lower birthweight (as standard deviation score [<z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>]) and infancy <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in 19-year-olds born before 32 weeks of gestation, and (2) the interaction between lower birthweight <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> and infancy <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>, as well as between lower birthweight and adult body composition, on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a prospective follow-up study in 346 subjects from the Project on Preterm and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001511'>Small-for-gestational-age infants</z:hpo> cohort, in whom fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels were measured at 19 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo> was calculated with homeostatic modelling (homeostatic model assessment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> index [HOMA-IR]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Birthweight <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> was unrelated to the outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rapid infancy <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> until 3 months post-term was weakly associated with higher insulin level (p=0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adult fatness was positively associated with insulin and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels and HOMA-IR (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On these parameters, there was a statistical interaction between birthweight <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> and adult fat mass (p=0.002 to 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In subjects born very preterm, rapid infancy <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> until 3 months predicted higher insulin levels at 19 years, but the association was weak </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> strongly predicted higher insulin and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels as well as HOMA-IR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The effect of adult fat mass on these parameters was dependent on its interaction with birthweight <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
