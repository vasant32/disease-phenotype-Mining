<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis in 902 women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from the Nurses' Health Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dietary information was obtained using semiquantitative food frequency questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After adjustment for age, smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, aspirin use, HbA(1c), history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo>, and postmenopausal hormone use, intakes of cereal fiber and fruit fiber (P for trend = 0.002 and 0.036, respectively) were significantly associated with an increasing trend of plasma adiponectin concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further adjustment for BMI did not appreciably change the associations for cereal fiber but attenuated the associations for fruit fiber </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adiponectin concentrations were 24% higher in the highest compared with the lowest quintile of cereal fiber </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Dietary glycemic load and glycemic index were significantly associated with lower plasma adiponectin levels, after adjustment for BMI and other covariates (P for trend = 0.01 and 0.03, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The percent differences in adiponectin concentration between the highest and the lowest quintiles of dietary glycemic load and glycemic index were 17 and 18%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The associations between dietary factors and plasma adiponectin were consistent across lean (BMI &lt;25 kg/m(2)), overweight (25 &lt;or= BMI &lt;30 kg/m(2)), and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects (BMI &gt;or=30 kg/m(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that dietary cereal fiber and glycemic load/index are associated with the circulating adiponectin concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Such associations were not modified by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> status </plain></SENT>
