<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the relationship between the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> and cognitive status remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This was explored using baseline cognitive measures collected in the ongoing Memory in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> (MIND) substudy of the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> (ACCORD) trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The relationship of A1C and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) levels to performance on four cognitive tests was assessed, adjusting for age and other determinants of cognitive status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The tests were the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE), Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, and Stroop Test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A statistically significant age-adjusted association was observed between the A1C level and the score on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four cognitive tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Specifically, a 1% higher A1C value was associated with a significant 1.75-point lower DSST score (95% CI -1.22 to -2.28; P &lt; 0.0001), a 0.20-point lower MMSE score (-0.11 to -0.28; P &lt; 0.0001), a 0.11-point lower memory score (-0.02 to -0.19, P = 0.0142), and a worse score (i.e., 0.75 s more) on the Stroop Test (1.31-0.19, P = 0.0094) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The association between the DSST score and A1C persisted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> multiple linear regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FPG was not associated with test performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Higher A1C levels are associated with lower cognitive function in individuals with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> lowering on cognitive function will be determined by the ongoing ACCORD-MIND trial </plain></SENT>
