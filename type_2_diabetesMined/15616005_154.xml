<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Vastus lateralis muscle was obtained by percutaneous biopsy from 11 volunteers with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; 12 age-, sex-, and weight-matched <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> sedentary nondiabetic volunteers; and 8 lean volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subsarcolemmal and intermyofibrillar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> fractions were isolated by differential centrifugation and digestion techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall electron transport chain activity was similar in type 2 diabetic and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects, but subsarcolemmal mitochondria electron transport chain activity was reduced in type 2 diabetic subjects (0.017 +/- 0.003 vs. 0.034 +/- 0.007 units/mU <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase [CK], P = 0.01) and sevenfold reduced compared with lean subjects (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Electron transport chain activity in intermyofibrillar mitochondria was similar in type 2 diabetic and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects, though reduced compared with lean subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A reduction in subsarcolemmal mitochondria was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although mtDNA was lower in type 2 diabetic and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects, the decrement in electron transport chain activity was proportionately greater, indicating functional impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because of the potential importance of subsarcolemmal mitochondria for signal transduction and substrate transport, this deficit may contribute to the pathogenesis of muscle <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
