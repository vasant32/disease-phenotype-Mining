<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We consecutively recruited Chinese patients with type 2 DM requiring <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering therapy according to current guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were started on either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> 10 mg daily or given an equivalent dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40303">lovastatin</z:chebi> 20 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 12 weeks of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> therapy, patients had fasting <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profiles repeated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ApoE genotyping was performed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ninety-six patients were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The epsilon3/epsilon3 genotype was in 62.5%, epsilon2/epsilon3 and epsilon3/epsilon4, 16.7 and 20.8%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for confounding variables, baseline total cholesterol (TC) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>) levels were significantly higher in those with epsilon3/epsilon4 compared with epsilon2/epsilon3 genotype (6.7 vs. 5.5 mm for TC, 4.5 vs. 3.6 mm for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>; p = 0.015 and p = 0.025, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> therapy, epsilon3/epsilon4 patients had significantly greater <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> lowering compared with epsilon2/epsilon3 patients (48 vs. 27.7%; p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no gender difference in baseline <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> parameters or response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ApoE genotype accounts for interindividual variability of baseline cholesterol levels, and response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> therapy in Chinese patients with type 2 DM </plain></SENT>
