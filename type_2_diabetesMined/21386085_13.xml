<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study tests whether common genetic variants with pleiotropic effects account for some of the correlated architecture among five metabolic phenotypes that define MetS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Seven studies of the STAMPEED consortium, comprising 22,161 participants of European ancestry, underwent genome-wide association analyses of metabolic traits using a panel of ∼2.5 million imputed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Phenotypes were defined by the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) criteria for MetS in pairwise combinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Individuals exceeding the NCEP thresholds for both traits of a pair were considered affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS Twenty-nine common variants were associated with MetS or a pair of traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Variants in the genes LPL, CETP, APOA5 (and its cluster), GCKR (and its cluster), LIPC, TRIB1, LOC100128354/MTNR1B, ABCB11, and LOC100129150 were further tested for their association with individual qualitative and quantitative traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the 16 top SNPs (one per gene) associated simultaneously with more than two individual traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of them 11 variants showed nominal associations with MetS per se </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The effects of 16 top SNPs on the quantitative traits were relatively small, together explaining from ∼9% of the variance in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, 5.8% of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi>, 3.6% of fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and 1.4% of systolic blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS Qualitative and quantitative pleiotropic tests on pairs of traits indicate that a small portion of the covariation in these traits can be explained by the reported common genetic variants </plain></SENT>
