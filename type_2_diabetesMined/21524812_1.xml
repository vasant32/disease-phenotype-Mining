<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the anti-diabetic effect of PM021 on an animal model of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> of Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight weeks of age male OLETF rats were treated daily with PM021 or vehicle for five months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Specifically, changes in body weight, blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, urine volume, food intake and oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance were measured in rats for five months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rats in this study were divided into four groups: a Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) rat group, which is a genetic control group for OLETF, that received no treatment; a PM021 treatment group of LETO rats; OLETF rats that received no treatment; and OLETF rats that received PM021 treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results showed that PM021 significantly prevented increases in body weight, blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and urine and food intake that resulted from the induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PM021 also <z:mp ids='MP_0005292'>improved glucose tolerance</z:mp> in OLETO rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, PM021 had no effect on LETO rats, a control group of OLETF rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these findings indicate that PM021 has distinct anti-diabetic effects without any adverse effects or toxicities </plain></SENT>
