<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the RBP4 gene represents a plausible candidate gene involved in susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this study, the RBP4 gene was sequenced in DNA samples from 48 nonrelated Caucasian subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five novel and three known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, five recently reported SNPs were genotyped in 90 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six SNPs, representative of their linkage disequilibrium groups, were then genotyped in 934 diabetic and 716 nondiabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A haplotype of six common SNPs (A-G-G-T-G-C) was significantly increased in 934 case subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with 537 healthy control subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (P = 0.02; odds ratio 1.37 [95% CI 1.05-1.79]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in the cohort of 716 nondiabetic Caucasian subjects, carriers of the A-G-G-T-G-C haplotype had significantly higher mean fasting plasma insulin and 2-h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> than subjects without the haplotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two single SNPs (rs10882283 and rs10882273) were also associated with BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, and fasting plasma insulin, and several SNPs were associated with circulating free fatty acids (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> adjusted P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, subjects carrying a previously reported <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-associated haplotype had significantly higher <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels in visceral adipose tissue (adjusted P &lt; 0.05) in a subgroup of nondiabetic subjects (n = 170) with measurements of RBP4 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in visceral and subcutaneous fat depots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate a role of RBP4 genetic variation in susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, possibly through an effect on RBP4 expression </plain></SENT>
