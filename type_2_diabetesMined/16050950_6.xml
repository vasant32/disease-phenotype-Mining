<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 genotyping was performed by RFLP analysis in a subset of 426 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two hundred and thirty-one (54.2%) patients were homozygous for the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wildtype</z:mp> allele (AA), 156 (36.6%) were heterozygous (AG) and 39 (9.2%) were homozygous for the mutated allele (GG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Allelic frequency was similar to non-diabetic populations (<z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wildtype</z:mp> allele A: 0.73; mutated allele G: 0.27) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 mean concentrations and percentiles were substantially higher in non-diabetic populations but were not influenced by the genotype (AA: 662.0 +/- 323.0 pg/ml; AG: 730.6 +/- 491.4 pg/ml; GG: 641.2 +/- 323.8 pg/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 serum levels and genotypes were only marginally related to hormones (insulin and leptin) and cytokines (TNF-alpha and IL-6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study providing <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 levels, percentiles and genotype frequency in a large and representative cohort of patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared to the literature, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 levels were found to be substantially higher in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, genotype frequencies were similar compared to those in non-diabetic patients and were not related to <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms behind these elevated <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 serum levels in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are not to be explained by simple associations with hormones, cytokines or genotypes </plain></SENT>
