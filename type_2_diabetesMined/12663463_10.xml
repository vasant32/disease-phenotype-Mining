<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that the expression of a novel gene, Tanis, was upregulated in the liver during fasting in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>/diabetic animal model Psammomys obesus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we have further studied the protein and its function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cell fractionation indicated that Tanis was localized in the plasma membrane and microsomes but not in the nucleus, mitochondria, or soluble protein fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Consistent with previous gene expression data, hepatic Tanis protein levels increased more significantly in diabetic P. obesus than in nondiabetic controls after fasting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used a recombinant adenovirus to increase Tanis expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019204" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatoma</z:e> H4IIE cells and investigated its role in metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Tanis overexpression reduced <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake, basal and insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthesis, and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> content and attenuated the suppression of PEPCK gene expression by insulin, but it did not affect insulin-stimulated insulin receptor phosphorylation or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that Tanis may be involved in the regulation of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism, and increased expression of Tanis could contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in the liver </plain></SENT>
