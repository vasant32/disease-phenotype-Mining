<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 208 subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> self-care, assessed by questionnaire, was evaluated before, and 4 months after attending a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> education course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 121 subjects who received advanced <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> education courses were designated as the experimental group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A second group of 87 cases receiving a basic course served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition to basic knowledge, the advanced education programs included dietary control, blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring, management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>, medication compliance, foot care and exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> self-care techniques were significantly improved in the experimental group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall score for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-care techniques improved in both groups at the 4th month over baseline values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The change was significant with the controls' (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multiple regression analysis confirmed the intensity of diabetic education was the only significant variable correlated with the decrease of fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and systolic blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, integrated and intensive <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> education program in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> education centers provides an effective method for improving <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-care techniques and metabolic outcome </plain></SENT>
