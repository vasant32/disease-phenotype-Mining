<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> (a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor) and voglibose (an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor) monotherapy in Japanese patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who have inadequate glycaemic control (HbA1c &gt; or =6.5% and &lt;10.0%) on diet and exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study, 319 patients were randomized (1:1) to 12-week treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> 50 mg once daily or voglibose 0.2 mg thrice daily before meals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary analysis assessed whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> was non-inferior to voglibose in lowering HbA1c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 12 weeks, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> was non-inferior to voglibose for HbA1c-lowering efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> was superior to voglibose, providing significantly greater reductions in HbA1c from baseline [least squares mean changes in HbA1c [95% confidence intervals (CI)] = -0.7% (-0.8 to -0.6) and -0.3% (-0.4 to -0.2), respectively; between-group difference = -0.4% (-0.5 to -0.3), p &lt; 0.001] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">Sitagliptin</z:chebi> was also superior to voglibose on other key efficacy endpoints, including change from baseline in 2-h postmeal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (-2.8 mmol/l vs. -1.8 mmol/l, p &lt; 0.001) and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (-1.1 mmol/l vs. -0.5 mmol/l, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 12 weeks, the incidences of clinical adverse experiences (AEs), drug-related AEs and gastrointestinal AEs in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> group (48.5, 10.4 and 18.4%, respectively) were significantly (p &lt; 0.05) lower than those in the voglibose group (64.7, 26.3 and 34.6%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidences of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e>, serious AEs and discontinuations due to AEs were low and similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In Japanese patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, once-daily <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> monotherapy showed greater efficacy and better tolerability than thrice-daily voglibose over 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
