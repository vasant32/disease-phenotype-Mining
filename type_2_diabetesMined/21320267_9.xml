<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted an electronic search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving DPP-4 inhibitors through September 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RCTs were included if they lasted at least 12 weeks, included 30 patients or more and reported the proportion of patients reaching the HbA1c target of &lt;7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 43 RCTs reporting 52 comparisons met the selection criteria, which included 19 101 study participants evaluated for the primary endpoint, 10 467 treated with a DPP-4 inhibitor and 8634 treated with placebo or a comparator drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DPP-4 inhibitors showed a statistically significant reduction in HbA1c compared to placebo and approximately 40% of participants achieved the HbA1c goal of &lt;7%: this was associated with weight neutrality and no greater <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The reduction of the HbA1c level and the rate of HbA1c goal attainment was not different from comparator drugs, with similar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e>, and different effect on weight owing to the nature of comparator (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">glitazones</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Baseline HbA1c was the best predictor for achievement of A1C target (overall weighted r(2) value = 0.410, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A greater proportion of type 2 diabetic patients can achieve the HbA1c goal &lt;7% with DPP-4 inhibitors compared to placebo, with no <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>, and no hypoglycaemic risk when used alone; DPP-4 inhibitors were not different from comparator drugs </plain></SENT>
