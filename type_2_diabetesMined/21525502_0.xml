<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To estimate, among privately insured youth in the U.S., medical expenditures associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the difference in medical expenditures between individuals with insulin-treated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (ITDM) and with non-ITDM (NITDM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using the 2007 MarketScan commercial claims and encounter database, we analyzed data for 49,356 youth (aged ≤ 19 years) who were continuously enrolled in fee-for-service health plans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Youth with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (cases) were identified from inpatient, outpatient, and pharmaceutical drug claims </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each case was matched with five controls (without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) by age (± 2 years), sex, census region, and urban versus rural residence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used regression models to estimate medical expenditures in total and by component (inpatient, outpatient, and medication) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The predicted mean annual total per-person medical expenditures were $9,061 for youth with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and $1,468 for those without, an excess of $7,593 for those with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; of which, 43% was for prescription drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The predicted mean annual total expenditures were $9,333 for ITDM youth and $5,683 for NITDM youth, respectively, an excess of $3,650 for those with ITDM <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, of which 59% was for prescription drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The excess medical expenditures associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, ITDM in particular, among youth are substantial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our estimates of excess expenditures can be used to assess the economic burden of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> overall and by <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treatment mode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our estimated excess expenditure for NITDM may be used for evaluating the economic efficiency of interventions aimed at preventing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in U.S. youth </plain></SENT>
