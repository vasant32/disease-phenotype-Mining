<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Given the close relationship between intrahepatic <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> content (IHL) and insulin sensitivity, we hypothesized that the direct relationship between fitness and insulin sensitivity may be explained by IHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We included 138 overweight to <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, otherwise healthy subjects (aged 43.6 +/- 8.9 years, BMI 33.8 +/- 4 kg/m(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Body composition was estimated by bioimpedance analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Abdominal fat distribution, intramyocellular, and IHL were assessed by magnetic resonance spectroscopy and tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Incremental exercise testing was performed to estimate an individual's CRF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity was determined during an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects, CRF was related to insulin sensitivity (r = 0.32, P &lt; 0.05), IHL (r = -0.27, P &lt; 0.05), and visceral (r = -0.25, P &lt; 0.05) and total fat mass (r = -0.32, P &lt; 0.05), but not to intramyocellular <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> (r = -0.08, NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity correlated significantly with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> fat depots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In multivariate regression analyses, independent predictors of insulin sensitivity were IHL, visceral fat, and fitness (r(2) = -0.43, P &lt; 0.01, r(2) = -0.34, and r(2) = 0.29, P &lt; 0.05, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the positive correlation between fitness and insulin sensitivity was abolished after adjustment for IHL (r = 0.16, NS), whereas it remained significant when adjusted for visceral or total body fat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further, when subjects were grouped into high versus low IHL, insulin sensitivity was higher in those subjects with low IHL, irrespective of fitness levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the positive effect of increased CRF on insulin sensitivity in overweight to <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects may be mediated indirectly through IHL reduction </plain></SENT>
