<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to test the role of FTO genetic variants in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the Chinese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We genotyped 19 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning from the 3' end of the neighboring RPGRIP1L gene to the 5' flanking region of the FTO gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We analyzed their associations with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (638 case and 1,610 control subjects), type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (759 case and 784 control subjects), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-related traits in nondiabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 19 SNPs, the rs9939609 A allele was strongly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (P = 7.0 x 10(-4)) and BMI (P = 0.0024) in the Chinese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> was 2.60 (95% CI 1.24-5.46) (P = 0.011) for the AA genotype and 1.32 (1.05-1.66) (P = 0.018) for the AT genotype compared with the TT genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Each additional copy of the rs9936609 A allele was associated with a BMI increase of approximately 0.37 kg/m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rs9939609 A allele was substantially less common in the Chinese population than in the European population (12.6 vs. 45%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We did not find significant associations of the 19 SNPs with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-related traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Genetic variation in the FTO gene is strongly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and BMI in the Chinese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The risk variant is less common in the Chinese population, but its effect size on BMI is comparable with that in the European population </plain></SENT>
