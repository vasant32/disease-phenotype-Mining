<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">Thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> (TZDs) can also induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0002591'>hyperphagia</z:hpo> in rats but conversely have an insulin-sensitizing effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate whether preventing TZD-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002591'>hyperphagia</z:hpo> (i.e. energy restriction) in dietary <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (DIO) rats would enhance the insulin-sensitizing effects of treatment at a therapeutic dose; and, within this paradigm, to produce an original survey of candidate TZD-gene targets in the clinically relevant visceral white adipose tissue (WAT) depot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: DIO rats that were either freely fed or energy restricted (i.e. pair-fed to the level of untreated controls) were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8892">rosiglitazone maleate</z:chebi> (RSG; 3 mg/kg/day) for 2 weeks, the restricted group controlling for treatment-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002591'>hyperphagia</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The outcome measures were circulating concentrations of various biochemical markers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, and gene expression was measured in epididymal WAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In both freely fed and pair-fed groups, compared to untreated DIO controls, RSG reduced plasma levels of insulin (-29% and -43%; p &lt; 0.05 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively), free fatty acids (FFAs; -45% and -48%; p &lt; 0.01 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively) and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (TGs; -63% and -72%; both p &lt; 0.001), reflected in improved insulin sensitivity, as measured by homeostasis model assessment (-29% and -43%; p &lt; 0.01 and p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RSG also increased the expression of the fatty acid transport/synthesis genes, fatty acid transport protein (2.4-3.2-fold), epidermal fatty acid-binding protein (FABP; 1.7-2.0-fold), heart FABP (25-29-fold) and fatty acid synthase (2.3-2.9-fold; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p &lt; 0.05) in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adipocyte FABP was also increased by RSG treatment, but only in combination with energy restriction (1.52-fold; p &lt; 0.05) as was hexokinase II expression (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the drug had no effect on expression of several genes associated with lipolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-induced hyperleptinaemia was normalized only in the energy-restricted group, leptin <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>) expression was reduced in both treated groups (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Resistin and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha expression was also reduced, though in the latter case, only with energy restriction (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Other adipokines were unaffected by RSG treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results clearly show that energy restriction enhances the therapeutic efficacy of TZDs and suggest that this occurs, at least in part, through a modulatory effect on gene expression in visceral WAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These findings improve our understanding of the underlying mechanistic basis for the clinical usefulness of dietary restriction as an adjunct to TZD therapy in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
