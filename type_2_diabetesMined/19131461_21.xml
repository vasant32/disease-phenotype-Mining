<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Study participants included 6,736 nondiabetic Japanese men aged 40-55 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was diagnosed in those who had an FPG &gt;or=126 mg/dl or who were being treated with an oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> agent or insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The models including FPG, A1C, and both were compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the 4-year follow-up period, we confirmed 659 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, both FPG and A1C were independently associated with the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The model including both FPG and A1C had a greater AUROC curve than that including FPG alone (0.853 vs. 0.818; P &lt; 0.001) or A1C alone (0.853 vs. 0.771; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The combined measurement of FPG and A1C was effective for predicting type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
