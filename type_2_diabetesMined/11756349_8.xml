<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies in nondiabetic Pima Indians showed that one of the at-risk DNA polymorphisms, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-43, in CAPN10 was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, and individuals with the G/G-genotype had significantly higher fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and 2-h insulin concentrations after a 75-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have examined the effect of variation in CAPN10 on plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin levels in a group of 285 nondiabetic British subjects after a 75-g OGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results showed that subjects with G/G genotype at SNP-43 had higher 2-h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels than the combined G/A + A/A group (P = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also examined the SNP-43, -19, and -63 haplotype combination 112/121, which is associated with an approximately threefold increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subjects with the 112/121 haplotype combination (n = 29) had increased fasting (P = 0.004) and 2-h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels (P = 0.003) compared with the rest of the study population after correction for age, sex, and BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 112/121 haplotype combination was also associated with a marked decrease in the insulin secretory response, adjusted for the level of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that genetic variation in the CAPN10 gene influences blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels in nondiabetic British subjects and that this is due, at least in part, to the effects of calpain-10 on the early insulin secretory response </plain></SENT>
