<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The nuclear receptors, including nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group H, member 3 (NR1HR, also known as liver X receptor [LXR]), are sensors of cholesterol metabolism and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> biosynthesis that have recently been proposed as insulin sensitisers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TNFalpha has been described as a link between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, an important contributor to the pathogenesis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we decided to investigate the ability of NR1HR <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> to ameliorate TNFalpha-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in brown adipocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Primary brown adipocytes from rat fetuses, and from <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> neonate mice and neonate mice deficient in the gene encoding protein tyrosine phosphatase-1B (Ptpn1, also known as Ptp1b) were cultured in the absence or presence of TNFalpha and different nuclear receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among them, the unrelated NR1HR ligands T0901317, GW3965 and (22R)-hydroxycholesterol were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After insulin stimulation, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake and solute carrier family 2 (facilitated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transporter), member 4 (SLC2A4, formerly known as GLUT4) translocation were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Next the insulin signalling cascade was determined by submitting cells to lysis, immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: NR1HR <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> ameliorate TNFalpha-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> restoring completely insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake and SLC2A4 translocation to plasma membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This effect is parallel to the recovery of the insulin cascade insulin receptor/IRS-2/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B, and could be due to the fact that T0901317 prevents the increase of PTPN1 production and phosphatase activity produced by TNFalpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this regard, Ptpn1-deficient brown adipocytes showed protection against <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> by TNFalpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we observed that T0901317 produced in itself a significant increase over basal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake consistent with an increase of SLC2A4 protein content in plasma membrane, attributable to the activation of protein kinase zeta and/or the increase of Slc2a4 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Nuclear receptors NR1HR are interesting potential targets for drug treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
