<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In adults the same situation is often referred to as latent autoimmune <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in adults (LADA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We tested whether genetic markers associated with type 1 or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> could help to discriminate between autoimmune and non-autoimmune <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in young (15-34 years) and middle-aged (40-59 years) diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 1,642 young and 1,619 middle-aged patients we determined: (1) HLA-DQB1 genotypes; (2) PTPN22 and INS variable-number tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphisms; (3) two single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs7903146 and rs10885406) in the TCF7L2 gene; (4) glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and IA-2-protein tyrosine phosphatase-like protein (IA-2) antibodies; and (5) fasting plasma C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Frequency of risk genotypes HLA-DQB1 (60% vs 25%, p = 9.4 x 10(-34); 45% vs 18%, p = 1.4 x 10(-16)), PTPN22 CT/TT (34% vs 26%, p = 0.0023; 31% vs 23%, p = 0.034), INS VNTR class I/I (69% vs 53%, p = 1.3 x 10(-8); 69% vs 51%, p = 8.5 x 10(-5)) and INS VNTR class IIIA/IIIA (75% vs 63%, p = 4.3 x 10(-6); 73% vs 60%, p = 0.008) was increased in young and middle-aged GAD antibodies (GADA)-positive compared with GADA-negative patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-associated genotypes of TCF7L2 CT/TT of rs7903146 were significantly more common in young GADA-negative than in GADA-positive patients (53% vs 43%; p = 0.0004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No such difference was seen in middle-aged patients, in whom the frequency of the CT/TT genotypes of TCF7L2 was similarly increased in GADA-negative and GADA-positive groups (55% vs 56%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Common variants in the TCF7L2 gene help to differentiate young but not middle-aged GADA-positive and GADA-negative diabetic patients, suggesting that young GADA-negative patients have type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and that middle-aged GADA-positive patients are different from their young GADA-positive counterparts and share genetic features with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
