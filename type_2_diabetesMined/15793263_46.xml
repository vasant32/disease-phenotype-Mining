<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study evaluates the role of ENPP1 K121Q polymorphism in prediction of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in three populations that differ in susceptibility to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and environmental exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The three cohorts included 679 nonmigrant South Asians living in Chennai, India (223 with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>); 1,083 migrant South Asians living in Dallas, Texas (121 with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>); and 858 nonmigrant Caucasians living in Dallas, Texas (141 with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were included in these cohorts if they had <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> before the age of 60 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of subjects carrying the polymorphic ENPP1 121Q allele was 25% in the nondiabetic group and 34% in the diabetic group of South Asians living in Chennai (P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence in the nondiabetic and diabetic groups were 33 and 45% (P = 0.01) for the South Asians living in Dallas and 26 and 39% (P = 0.003) for the Caucasians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although further replication studies are necessary to test the validity of the described genotype-phenotype relationship, our study supports the hypothesis that ENPP1 121Q predicts genetic susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in both South Asians and Caucasians </plain></SENT>
