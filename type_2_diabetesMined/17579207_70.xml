<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the current study was to investigate the notion that increased numbers of macrophages exist in the islets of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients and that this may be explained by a dysregulation of islet-derived inflammatory factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Increased islet-associated immune cells were observed in human type 2 diabetic patients, high-fat-fed C57BL/6J mice, the GK rat, and the db/db mouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When cultured islets were exposed to a type 2 diabetic milieu or when islets were isolated from high-fat-fed mice, increased islet-derived inflammatory factors were produced and released, including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, chemokine KC, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The specificity of this response was investigated by direct comparison to nonislet pancreatic tissue and beta-cell lines and was not mimicked by the induction of islet cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further, this <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> was found to be biologically functional, as conditioned medium from human islets exposed to a type 2 diabetic milieu could induce increased migration of monocytes and neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This migration was blocked by IL-8 neutralization, and IL-8 was localized to the human pancreatic alpha-cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, islet-derived inflammatory factors are regulated by a type 2 diabetic milieu and may contribute to the macrophage infiltration of pancreatic islets that we observe in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
