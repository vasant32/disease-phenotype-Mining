<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> is an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drug commonly used to treat type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to determine whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> regulates hepatic gluconeogenesis through the orphan nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP; NR0B2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We assessed the regulation of hepatic SHP gene expression by Northern blot analysis with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and adenovirus containing a constitutive active form of <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (AMPK) (Ad-AMPK) and evaluated SHP, PEPCK, and G6Pase promoter activities via transient transfection assays in hepatocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Knockdown of SHP using siRNA SHP was conducted to characterize the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>-induced inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenic gene expression in hepatocytes, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>-and adenovirus SHP (Ad-SHP)-mediated hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production was measured in B6-Lep(ob/ob) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Hepatic SHP gene expression was induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, 5-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="22512">aminoimidazole</z:chebi>-4-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="23004,37622">carboxamide</z:chebi>-1-beta-d-ribofuranoside (AICAR), and Ad-AMPK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi>-induced SHP gene expression was abolished by adenovirus containing the dominant negative form of AMPK (Ad-DN-AMPK), as well as by compound C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> inhibited hepatocyte nuclear factor-4alpha-or FoxA2-mediated promoter activity of PEPCK and G6Pase, and the inhibition was blocked with siRNA SHP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, SHP knockdown by adenovirus containing siRNA SHP inhibited <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>-mediated repression of cAMP/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi>-induced hepatic gluconeogenic gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, oral administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> increased SHP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels in B6-Lep(ob/ob) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of SHP by Ad-SHP decreased blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels and hepatic gluconeogenic gene expression in B6-Lep(ob/ob) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We have concluded that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis through AMPK-dependent regulation of SHP </plain></SENT>
