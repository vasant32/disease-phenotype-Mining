<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four regional <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> declarations followed - Europe, the Americas, the Western Pacific, and Africa - which paved the way for national <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> programmes (NDPs) in many countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As a result of the UN Resolution on <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> (2006), the International <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Federation (IDF) resolved to reinvigorate NDPs and established a Task Force for this purpose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite the growth of NDPs over the past 20 years, no formal global evaluation of their status appears to have been undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Consequently, in 2008, the Task Force conducted a baseline survey of IDF member associations (n=202) worldwide seeking information on the existence, scope and status of NDPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The survey achieved a 47% response rate with 61% of respondents indicating their country had an NDP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these, 83% had a prevention component, and 96% had type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> as the most commonly occurring focus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, the survey indicated a strong core of cohesive national action on <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> worldwide but highlighted the need for a concerted effort to develop and implement comprehensive national prevention and care plans aimed at reducing the personal, familial and societal burden of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
