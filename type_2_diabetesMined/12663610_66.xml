<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review of the published literature on the efficacy and safety of herbal therapies and vitamin/mineral supplements for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted an electronic literature search of MEDLINE, OLDMEDLINE, Cochrane Library Database, and HealthSTAR, from database inception to May 2002, in addition to performing hand searches and consulting with experts in the field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Available clinical studies published in the English language that used human participants and examined glycemic control were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data were extracted in a standardized manner, and two independent investigators assessed methodological quality of randomized controlled trials using the Jadad scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 108 trials examining 36 herbs (single or in combination) and 9 vitamin/mineral supplements, involving 4,565 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo>, met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 58 controlled clinical trials involving individuals with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (42 randomized and 16 nonrandomized trials) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most studies involved patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>Heterogeneity</z:hpo> and the small number of studies per supplement precluded formal meta-analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of these 58 trials, the direction of the evidence for improved <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control was positive in 76% (44 of 58) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Very few adverse effects were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is still insufficient evidence to draw definitive conclusions about the efficacy of individual herbs and supplements for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; however, they appear to be generally safe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The available data suggest that several supplements may warrant further study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The best evidence for efficacy from adequately designed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is available for Coccinia indica and American ginseng </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="74" ids="28073">Chromium</z:chebi> has been the most widely studied supplement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Other supplements with positive preliminary results include Gymnema sylvestre, Aloe vera, <z:chebi fb="11" ids="27698,35170">vanadium</z:chebi>, Momordica charantia, and nopal </plain></SENT>
