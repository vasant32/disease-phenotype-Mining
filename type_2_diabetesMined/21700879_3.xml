<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous linkage studies suggest that different genetic components might be involved in determining HMW and total adiponectin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of serum HMW adiponectin levels in individuals of European ancestry drawn from the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) (N = 1,591) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified in the GWAS analysis were replicated in an independent cohort of Europeans (N = 626) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We examined the associations of the identified variations with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified a novel locus near the FER gene (5q21) at a genome-wide significance level, best represented by SNP rs10447248 (P = 4.69 Ã— 10(-8)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also confirmed that variations near the adiponectin-encoding ADIPOQ locus (3q27) were related to serum HMW adiponectin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, we found that FER SNP rs10447248 was related to <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> levels (P = 0.009); ADIPOQ variation was associated with fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (P = 0.04), <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (P = 0.04), and a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> score (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that different loci may be involved in regulation of circulating HMW adiponectin levels and provide novel insight into the mechanisms that affect HMW adiponectin homeostasis </plain></SENT>
