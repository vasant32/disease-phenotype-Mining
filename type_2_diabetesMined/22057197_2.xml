<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Interventions to improve body weight and composition aim to restore balance between nutrient intake and energy expenditure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Myostatin, a powerful negative regulator of skeletal muscle mass, has emerged as a potential therapeutic target for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> because of the prominent role skeletal muscle plays in metabolic rate and insulin-mediated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In fact, inhibition of myostatin by genetic manipulation or pharmacological means leads to a hypermuscular and very lean build in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The resistance of myostatin-null mice to diet-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, fat mass accumulation and metabolic dysfunction has been presumed to be a result of their large skeletal muscle mass; however, in this issue of Diabetologia, Zhang et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(doi: 10.1007/s00125-011-2304-4 ) provide evidence that myostatin inhibition also significantly impacts the phenotype of white adipose tissue (WAT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The authors reveal elevated expression of key metabolic genes of fatty acid transport and oxidation and, intriguingly, the presence of brown adipose tissue-like cells in WAT of myostatin-null mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They also show that pharmacological inhibition of myostatin replicates several of the protective benefits conveyed by its genetic inactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Herein, these data, areas in need of further investigation and the evidence that implicates myostatin as a target for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> are discussed </plain></SENT>
