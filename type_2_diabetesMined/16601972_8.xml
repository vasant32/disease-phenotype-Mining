<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients also have <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, central <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidaemia</z:e>, thus showing similarities with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rare mutations in the ALMS1 gene cause severe gene disruption in Alström patients; however, ALMS1 gene polymorphisms are common in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to determine whether common variants in ALMS1 contribute to susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the UK population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Direct sequencing was performed on coding regions and intron/exon boundaries of the ALMS1 gene in 30 unrelated probands with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The linkage disequilibrium (LD; D' and r2) and haplotype structure were examined for the identified variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The common (minor allele frequency [MAF] &gt;5%) single-nucleotide polymorphisms tagging the common haplotypes (tagged SNPs [tSNPs]) were identified and genotyped in 1985 subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 2,047 control subjects and 521 families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 18 variants with MAF between 6 and 38% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three SNPs efficiently tagged three common haplotypes (rs1881245, rs3820700 and rs1320374) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no association (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p &gt; 0.05) between the tSNPs and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the case-control study and minor alleles of the tSNPs were not overtransmitted to probands with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the family study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Common variations in the ALMS1 gene were not associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a large study of a white UK population </plain></SENT>
