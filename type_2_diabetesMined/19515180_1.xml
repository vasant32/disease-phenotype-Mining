<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such benefits are based on actions mediated primarily through stimulation of insulin secretion or alleviation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examined the long-term actions of the stable GLP-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32437">D-Ala</z:chebi>(8))GLP-1 and the GIP receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> (Pro(3))GIP alone and in combination in high fat-fed mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Mice on high-fat diet for 155 days were injected once daily with (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32437">D-Ala</z:chebi>(8))GLP-1 or (Pro(3))GIP (25 nmol/kg body weight) for 24 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the following 24-day period, half of the (Pro(3))GIP-treated mice were administered an additional dose of (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32437">D-Ala</z:chebi>(8))GLP-1 (25 nmol/kg body weight), while the remaining mice continued their original treatment regimes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Daily intraperitoneal injections of (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32437">D-Ala</z:chebi>(8))GLP-1 or (Pro(3))GIP restored glycaemic control to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels and significantly (p &lt; 0.05) <z:mp ids='MP_0005292'>improved glucose tolerance</z:mp> compared with high-fat controls by day 24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Food intake and body weights were not affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On day 48, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treatment groups displayed significantly <z:mp ids='MP_0005292'>improved glucose tolerance</z:mp> (p &lt; 0.05) and insulin sensitivity (p &lt; 0.001) compared with high-fat controls on day 48 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> levels were significantly increased in mice treated with (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32437">D-Ala</z:chebi>(8))GLP-1 alone (p &lt; 0.05) or in combination with (Pro(3))GIP (p &lt; 0.01) compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chow-fed controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results illustrate efficacy of (Pro(3))GIP and (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32437">D-Ala</z:chebi>(8))GLP-1 for treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> caused by high-fat feeding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Combination therapy appeared to have little benefit over either treatment alone </plain></SENT>
