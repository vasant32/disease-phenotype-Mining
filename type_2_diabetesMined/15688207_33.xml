<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cross-sectional study of subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> enrolled in seven medical centres in the USA participating in a Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study of glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Enrolled subjects included 309 veterans over 40 years of age with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, with or without stable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, who had inadequate glycaemic control (HbA(1)c&gt;7.5%) on oral agents and/or insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study assessed lifestyle behaviours, standard <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> and coronary artery and abdominal aorta calcification by electron beam computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Subjects with coronary artery or abdominal aorta calcification present had a strikingly higher prevalence of peripheral artery disease, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> combined <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of each condition increased from 5- to 13-fold with increasing quintiles of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001717'>coronary artery calcification</z:hpo> and from 2- to 3-fold with increasing abdominal aorta calcification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These associations persisted after adjustment for lifestyle behaviours and standard <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These results support the notion that vascular calcium in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> provides additional information beyond that of standard risk factors in identifying the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subclinical measures of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0003207'>arterial calcification</z:hpo> may help more precisely stratify these individuals and alert healthcare providers to those individuals who have particularly <z:hpo ids='HP_0004943'>accelerated atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
