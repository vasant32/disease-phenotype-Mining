<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A mono-centre, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, phase III trial (l-arg trial) was conducted on 144 individuals affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> (MS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>l-Arg/placebo was administered (6.4 g/day) on a background structured lifestyle intervention for 18 months plus a 12-month extended follow-up period after study drug termination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance after oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test were evaluated throughout the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 18 months, l-arg as compared with placebo did not reduce the cumulative incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> [21.4 and 20.8%, respectively, hazard ratio (HR), 1.04; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.58-1.86] while the cumulative probability to become <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerant (NGT) increased (42.4 and 22.1%, respectively, HR, 2.60; 95% CI, 1.51-4.46, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The higher cumulative probability to become of NGT was maintained during the extended period in subjects previously treated with l-arg (HR, 3.21; 95% CI, 1.87-5.51; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the end of the extended period, the cumulative incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in subjects previously treated with l-arg was reduced as compared with placebo (27.2 and 47.1%, respectively, HR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.24-0.75, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During both periods, l-arg significantly improved insulin sensitivity and Î²-cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Among persons with IGT and MS, the supplementation of l-arg for 18 months does not significantly reduce the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> but does significantly increase regression to NGT </plain></SENT>
