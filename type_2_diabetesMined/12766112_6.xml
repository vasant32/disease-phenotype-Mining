<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Analyses were performed using population estimates from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)-III, cost estimates from a health system perspective, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-lowering effectiveness from pivotal clinical trials, and treatment effectiveness from the diabetic subgroup analysis of the Heart Protection Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: -There are approximately 8.2 million Americans with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> levels &gt; or =100 mg/dl, and no clinical evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each year, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> therapy could prevent approximately 71,000 major coronary events in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the subgroup with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> levels 100-129 mg/dl, the annual cost of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> treatment ranges from 600 to 1,000 US dollars per subject </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the population with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> levels &gt; or =130 mg/dl, the annual cost ranges from 700 to 2,100 US dollars </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Annual incremental cost per subject, defined as the cost of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> treatment plus the cost of major coronary events with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> treatment minus the cost of major coronary events without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> treatment, ranges from 480 to 950 US dollars in the subgroup with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> levels 100-129 mg/dl and from 590 to 1,920 US dollars in the population with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> levels &gt; or =130 mg/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">Statin</z:chebi> therapy for the primary prevention of major coronary events in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> levels 100-129 mg/dl is affordable and cost effective relative to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> therapy in subjects with higher <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
