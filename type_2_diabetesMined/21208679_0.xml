<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were obtained from a cohort of 1122 diabetic and non-diabetic patients from clinics in Trinidad </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Variables measured included demographics, HbA1(c), serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile values and diabetic status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The sample consisted of 476 males (61.6% diabetic) and 646 females (50.3% diabetic) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most patients (59.2%) were Indo-Trinidadian, 23.4% were Afro-Trinidadian and 13.5% were of 'mixed' and 'other' categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The majority (55.1%) of the patients were diabetic and diabetics were older than non-diabetics (p=0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Abnormal <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile OR=0.728, CI (0.532, 0.994), serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> categories OR=1.520, CI (1.317, 1.754), gender OR=0.690, CI (0.533, 0.892) and age groups OR=1.305, CI (1.185, 1.437) were useful predictors of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ethnicity was not a useful predictor: OR=1.007, CI (0.869, 1.168) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> (mean) was found to be lower in diabetics aged 21-50 than in their non-diabetic counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, above 50 years old, the reverse was true </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> means were higher in males than in females (p=0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Abnormal <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile, gender, age and serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> are associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>While age and gender are non-modifiable risk factors, steps should be taken to monitor and control the serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile values of diabetics and non-diabetics </plain></SENT>
