<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 247 overweight Latino children (baseline age = 11.1 +/- 1.7 years) with a parental history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were followed annually for 5 years (2.2 +/- 1.2 observations/child) with measures of insulin sensitivity, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and disposition index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Longitudinal linear mixed-effects modeling was used to evaluate the influence of maternal versus paternal family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on changes in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk factors over age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Insulin sensitivity and the disposition index decreased over age (beta = -0.052 and beta = -0.033, P &lt; 0 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> insulin response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and fasting and 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> increased (beta = 0.019, beta = 0.002, and beta = 0.003, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Declines in insulin sensitivity were significantly greater in participants whose maternal grandmothers had a history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (beta = -0.03, P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Declines in the disposition index (beta = -0.02, P = 0.04) and increases in fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> were significantly influenced by a maternal history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (beta = 0.60, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Maternal but not paternal family history for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may have a significant impact on insulin dynamics, becoming more pronounced during growth in overweight Latino adolescents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further research is clearly warranted </plain></SENT>
