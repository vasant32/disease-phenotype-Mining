<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are now substantial data indicating that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi> mediate this effect of under-nutrition on beta cell mass and that even at physiological levels they restrain fetal beta cell development in utero </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There are emerging clues that this occurs downstream of <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> commitment by neurogenin 3 but prior to terminal beta cell differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Deciphering the precise mechanism will be important as it might unveil new pathways by which to manipulate beta cell mass that could be exploited as novel therapies for patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
