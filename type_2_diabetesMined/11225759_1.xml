<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Prandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> regulation represents a new concept in the management of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>: targeting postprandial glycaemic excursions as a means of achieving long-term glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although control of the overall glycaemic load is the most important factor for the success of long-term management of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, control of postprandial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> also has positive implications for preventing the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Repaglinide is the first prandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> regulator to become available in the clinical setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It has a rapid and short-lived insulinotropic action and can therefore reduce postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excursions without increasing the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Short-term clinical studies showed that repaglinide is superior to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> in improving postprandial glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Longer-term studies confirmed that improved PGR is accompanied by improved overall glycaemic control that is at least equivalent to that achieved by sulphonylurea treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, because repaglinide can be used with flexible meal patterns without compromising <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control, it can improve quality of life as indicated by overall treatment satisfaction, well-being and health status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Repaglinide has few contraindications or drug interactions and can be used in a wide range of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although careful titration of repaglinide dose is recommended for patients with mild to moderate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal impairment</z:e>, no dosage adjustment is otherwise needed in the elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition to being an effective first-line hypoglycaemic agent, repaglinide is highly effective in combination therapy for patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who require more intensive treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> targets are not met using repaglinide monotherapy, the combination of repaglinide with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> can further improve glycaemic control by enhancing insulin secretion and improving insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Similarly, when required combination of repaglinide with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e>-insulin can produce better glycaemic control than monotherapy alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Given that most patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> require a multitherapy approach to achieve and sustain adequate glycaemic control, repaglinide will be an important element in future intensive therapy regimens </plain></SENT>
