<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine possible differences in <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> mellitus (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e>) between aboriginal and non-aboriginal people in the Saskatoon Health District </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a prospective survey of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> women admitted for childbirth to the Saskatoon Royal University Hospital between January and July 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared prevalence rates, risk factors, and outcomes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> between aboriginal and non-aboriginal women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Information was obtained from 2,006 women, of whom 252 aboriginal and 1,360 non-aboriginal subjects had been tested for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> were 3.5% for women in the general population and 11.5% for aboriginal women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For those living within the Saskatoon Health District, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> rates were 3.7 and 6.4%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis demonstrated that aboriginal ethnicity, most notably when combined with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, was an independent predictor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pregravid BMI &gt; or = 27 kg/m(2) and maternal age &gt; or = 33 years were the most important risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> in aboriginal women, whereas previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e>, family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and maternal age &gt; or = 38 years were the strongest predictors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> in non-aboriginal women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There may be fundamental differences in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> between aboriginal and non-aboriginal people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> contributes to an increased risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in aboriginal women and their offspring, the impact of prevention and optimal treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> on the type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> epidemic in susceptible populations are important areas for further investigation </plain></SENT>
