<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In clinical trials, significant reductions in serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and weight were demonstrated for exenatide with primary glycemic effects of the twice daily formulation on prandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we review recent research with exenatide as adjunctive therapy in type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In particular, studies demonstrate ongoing benefit on glycemic control and weight reduction with continued therapy up to 82 weeks duration and efficacy as adjunctive therapy for patients taking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi>, and/or a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> and as compared to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> and various insulin formulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared to insulin, exenatide likely has greatest benefit for those patients who are overweight or who need improved prandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The new long-acting release formulation of exenatide has demonstrated slightly improved efficacy compared to the twice daily formulation as well as a reduction in gastrointestinal side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Emerging research is further exploring novel benefits of exenatide as adjunctive DM therapy, effects on prandial glycemic control, markers of <z:mp ids='MP_0001860'>hepatic inflammation</z:mp>, alternative dosage forms including intra-nasal administration, and effects on beta cell function </plain></SENT>
