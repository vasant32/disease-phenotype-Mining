<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A multicentre observational study using data from clinical records was conducted in Finland, France, Germany, Norway, Poland, Spain and the UK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data were collected for patients who added sulphonylurea or glitazone to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Effectiveness was defined as a change in <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA(1c)) from baseline to approximately 1 year after the initiation of additional therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To allow for comparisons between the two medication regimens, propensity score matching was employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment choice was analysed using a probit regression model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that treatment choice was associated with factors reflecting patient's characteristics, patient's experience with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, patient's health or to physician's characteristics at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with baseline, adding sulphonylurea to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> reduced HbA(1c) by 0.8% (p &lt; 0.0001), while adding glitazone to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> reduced HbA(1c) by 0.9% (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Percentage at HbA(1c) goal (6.5%) increased from 6.9 to 23.8% for the sulphonylurea group and 8.3 to 33.3% for the glitazone group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both groups had similar changes in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the probit regression model, age, HbA(1c), weight, treatment for weight reduction, history of macrovascular complications and type of physician were significant factors associated with treatment choice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study is consistent with the results of long-term randomized clinical trials in a clinical practice setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Both regimens were able to reduce HbA(1c) by about 1% </plain></SENT>
