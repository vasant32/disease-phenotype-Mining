<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated whether common polymorphisms in the adiponectin receptor 1 (ADIPOR1) gene mediating these effects influence the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD) in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Linkage disequilibrium analysis of 28 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning the entire ADIPOR1 locus revealed two haplotype blocks that could be tagged by six SNPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These six markers were typed in two populations of CAD-positive and -negative subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, one from Boston (n = 411) and the other from Italy (n = 533) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the Boston population, the three tags of the more 3' block were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significantly associated with CAD (P = 0.001-0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A similar trend, although not significant, was found in Italian subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Haplotype analysis of the combined populations revealed different haplotype distributions in case and control subjects (P = 0.0002), with one common haplotype being associated in homozygotes with a greater than threefold increase in cardiovascular risk (odds ratio 3.6 [95% CI 1.8-7.2]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Some of the genotypes associated with increased cardiovascular risk were associated with 30-40% lower ADIPOR1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels in blood mononuclear cells (n = 60) and adipose tissue biopsies (n = 28) (P = 0.001-0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings point to genetic variability at the ADIPOR1 locus as a strong determinant of CAD susceptibility in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
