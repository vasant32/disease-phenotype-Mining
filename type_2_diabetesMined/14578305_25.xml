<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To identify genetic elements that might confer susceptibility to diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, we performed a genome-wide analysis of gene-based single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a large cohort of Japanese patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In case-control association studies, patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were divided into two groups, one having <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> as well as overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> and the other (the control group) having diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> but with no signs of renal involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genotyping of these patients at &gt;55,000 SNP loci indicated a gene encoding solute carrier family 12 member 3 (SLC12A3) to be a good candidate for the susceptibility to diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, in view of a significant association of one landmark SNP located in the 24th intron (chi(2) = 15.4, P = 0.000087, odds ratio = 2.53 [95% CI 1.57-4.09]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subsequent analysis of additional genetic variations in this gene identified several SNPs that were significantly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, especially one in exon 23 (+78 G to A: Arg913Gln, chi(2) = 18.5, P = 0.00002, odds ratio = 2.53 [95% CI 1.64-3.90]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results implicated that substitution of Arg913 to Gln in the SLC12A3 gene might reduce the risk to develop diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> and suggested that the gene product might be a potential target for the prevention or treatment of this disease </plain></SENT>
