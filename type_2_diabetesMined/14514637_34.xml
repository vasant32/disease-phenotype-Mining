<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is unknown whether this is due to improved insulin sensitivity or insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated at baseline insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion applying frequently sampled intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (FSIGT) in 87 of 101 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> middle-aged subjects with IGT randomized into an intervention or a control group in the Finnish <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Prevention Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FSIGT was repeated after 4 years in 52 people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in any of the baseline anthropometric or metabolic characteristics between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 4-year weight and waist circumference decreases were greater in the intervention than in the control group (P = 0.043 and P = 0.025, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 4-year examination, insulin sensitivity (Si) tended to be higher in the intervention group (the difference between the mean values 36%; P = 0.067, and P = 0.136 after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, and baseline Si value) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was strong correlation between the 4-year changes in Si and weight (r = -0.628 and r = -0.710, for intervention and control groups; P &lt; 0.001 for both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the entire group, Si improved by 64% in the highest tertile of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> but deteriorated by 24% in those who gained weight (lowest tertile) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> insulin response declined significantly in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, Si markedly improved by weight reduction during the 4-year follow-up of individuals with IGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Insulin secretion remained constant for years in individuals with IGT who were able to lose weight </plain></SENT>
