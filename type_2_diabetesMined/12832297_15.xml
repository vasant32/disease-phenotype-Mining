<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This study was a randomized, crossover design of two 6-week periods with a 6-week washout period between treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 36) with a BMI &gt;25 kg/m(2) were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fourteen subjects completed the study with eligible dietary records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dietary instruction was provided on flexible diets with both a high and low GI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fasting venous blood samples were taken at the start and finish of each dietary period, and biochemical data were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multi- and univariate one-factor repeated-measures ANOVA were used to compare biochemical data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Glycemic load and GI were lower during the low-GI diet, and dietary fiber was lower during the high-GI diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The participants in the low-GI period consumed significantly fewer carbohydrates, such as white-wheat bread, white long-grain rice, potatoes, high-GI fruits, and carrots, and more carbohydrates, such as pinto beans, whole-meal wheat bread, and low-GI fruits than did participants in the high-GI period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in the amount of carbohydrates consumed, such as corn tortillas and dairy products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At the end of the study periods, A1c was improved on the low- compared with the high-GI diet (P &lt; 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that a low-GI diet, containing Mexican-style foods, may help to improve the metabolic control in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> diabetic subjects during a 6-week period </plain></SENT>
