<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diagnosing LADA has treatment implications because of the high risk of progression to insulin dependency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Currently, there are no recommendations for islet antibody testing in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult-onset</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we aimed to develop a clinical screening tool to identify adults at high risk of LADA who require islet antibody testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Subjects with LADA (n = 102, GAD antibody [GADA]+) and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 111, GADA-) (aged 30-75 years) were interviewed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical features documented were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, BMI, and personal and family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Any clinical feature that was significantly more frequent in LADA was designated as a distinguishing clinical feature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In each subject, a "LADA clinical risk score," based on the total number of distinguishing features, was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A prospective study of adults with newly diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 130) was used to determine whether the LADA clinical risk score could identify LADA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the retrospective study, five clinical features were more frequent in LADA compared with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at diagnosis: 1) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> &lt;50 years (P &lt; 0.0001), 2) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> symptoms (P &lt; 0.0001), 3) BMI &lt;25 kg/m2 (P = 0.0004), 4) personal history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> (P = 0.011), and 5) family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> (P = 0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the prospective study, the presence of at least two of these distinguishing clinical features (LADA clinical risk score &gt; or =2) had a 90% sensitivity and 71% specificity for identifying LADA and a negative predictive value for a LADA clinical risk score &lt; or =1 of 99% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: At least two distinguishing clinical features are found in a majority of patients with LADA at diagnosis and can be used to identify adults with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at higher risk for LADA </plain></SENT>
