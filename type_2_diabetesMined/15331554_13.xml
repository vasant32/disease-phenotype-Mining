<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously showed that mesangial cell phenotypic changes play an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We concluded that phenotypic changes were present in bone marrow (BM)-derived mesangial cell progenitors, as transplantation of BM from db/db mice, a model of type 2 diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, transferred the db genotype and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> phenotype to naive B6 mice recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The recipients did not develop <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; however, they did develop <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> and glomerular lesions mirroring those in the donors (i.e., glomerular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>, increased ECM, and <z:mp ids='MP_0000318'>increased cell number</z:mp> with cell proliferation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) facilitated invasion of the mesangial cells into ECM and proliferation in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, increased MMP-2 activity in db/db mesangial cell progenitors may partially explain increased mesangial cell repopulation and proliferation in B6 recipients of db/db BM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In summary, BM-derived mesangial cell progenitors may play a crucial role in the development and progression of ECM accumulation and mesangial cell proliferation in this model of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
