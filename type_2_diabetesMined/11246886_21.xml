<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genetic studies in humans have provided evidence of linkage of the apoA-II gene locus to plasma free fatty acid (FFA) levels and to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and transgenic mice overexpressing mouse apoA-II have elevated levels of both FFA and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We now show that apoA-II promotes <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and has diverse effects on fat homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ApoA-II transgenic mice have increased adipose mass and higher plasma leptin levels than C57BL/6J control mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were similar between apoA-II transgenic and control mice, but plasma insulin levels were elevated approximately twofold in the apoA-II transgenic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with control mice, apoA-II transgenic mice exhibited a delay in plasma clearance of a <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> bolus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adipose tissue isolated from fasted apoA-II transgenic mice exhibited a 50% decrease in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> hydrolysis compared with adipose tissue from control mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is consistent with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> response of adipose tissue to the increased insulin levels in the apoA-II transgenic mice and may partially explain the increased fat deposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Skeletal muscle isolated from fasted apoA-II transgenic mice exhibited reduced uptake of 2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15866">deoxyglucose</z:chebi> compared with muscles isolated from control mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our observations indicate that a primary disturbance in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> metabolism can result in several traits associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, consistent with the hypothesis that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> can, under certain circumstances, be related primarily to altered <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism rather than <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
