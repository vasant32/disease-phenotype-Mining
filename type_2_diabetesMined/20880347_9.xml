<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Female <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats, 7-8 weeks old, were placed on high-fat diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dapagliflozin (1 mg/kg/day, p.o.) was administered for ∼33 days either from initiation of high-fat diet or when rats were moderately hyperglycaemic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity and pancreatic function were evaluated using a hyperglycaemic clamp in anaesthetized animals (n = 5-6); β-cell function was quantified using the disposition index (DI) to account for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> compensation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pancreata from a matched subgroup (n = 7-8) were fixed and β-cell mass and islet <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> investigated using immunohistochemical methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Dapagliflozin, administered from initiation of high-fat feeding, reduced the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e>; after 24 days, blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was 8.6 ± 0.5 vs. 13.3 ± 1.3 mmol/l (p &lt; 0.005 vs. vehicle) and glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> 3.6 ± 0.1 vs. 4.8 ± 0.26% (p &lt; 0.003 vs. vehicle) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Dapagliflozin improved insulin sensitivity index: 0.08 ± 0.01 vs. 0.02 ± 0.01 in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> controls (p &lt; 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DI was improved to the level of lean control rats (dapagliflozin 0.29 ± 0.04; <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> control 0.15 ± 0.01; lean 0.28 ± 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In dapagliflozin-treated rats, β-cell mass was less variable and significant improvement in islet <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> was observed compared to vehicle-treated rats, although there was no change in mean β-cell mass with dapagliflozin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results were similar when dapagliflozin treatment was initiated when animals were already moderately hyperglycaemic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Sustained <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> lowering with dapagliflozin in this model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevented the continued decline in functional adaptation of pancreatic β-cells </plain></SENT>
