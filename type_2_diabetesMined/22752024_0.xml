<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether postprandial suppression of endogenous <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>-TAG secretion is abnormal--a finding that would link <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020473" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperlipidaemia</z:e> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>--remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eight type 2 diabetic men and eight healthy men were studied before and after a fat-free test meal (40% of resting energy expenditure) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>-TAG kinetics were assessed using a primed-constant infusion of ex vivo labelled [1-(14)C]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53753">triolein</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>-TAG using non-steady-state calculations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Type 2 diabetic men had a higher basal <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>-TAG secretion rate and concentration than healthy men (mean ± SD secretion rate 137 ± 61 vs 78 ± 30 μmol/min, respectively [p = 0.03]; median concentration 1.03 [range 0.58-1.75] vs 0.33 [0.13-1.14] mmol/l, respectively [p &lt; 0.01]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postprandially, the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>-TAG secretion rate decreased in healthy men (p &lt; 0.01), but remained unchanged in diabetic men (p = 0.47) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>-TAG concentration increased in diabetic men and decreased in healthy men postprandially (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The difference in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>-TAG secretion rate between the two groups approached significance (p = 0.06) and the relative change in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>-TAG secretion rate was significantly different (p = 0.01) between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Basal <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>-TAG clearance was significantly lower in diabetic men (diabetic men 133 [49-390] ml/min; healthy controls 215 [137-933] ml/min [p &lt; 0.05]) </plain></SENT>
