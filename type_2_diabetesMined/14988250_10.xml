<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Compared with Caucasians, Pima Indians have a high risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and exhibit marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> and elevated plasma levels of pancreatic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (PP), an islet hormone considered a surrogate marker of parasympathetic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (PNS) drive to the pancreas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To test if <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> in Pima Indians is due to increased vagal input to the beta-cell, we examined the effect of PNS blockade in 17 Caucasian (aged 35 +/- 8 years, body fat 23 +/- 7% [mean +/- SD]) and 17 Pima Indian males (aged 28 +/- 8 years, body fat 29 +/- 5%) with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each participant underwent four consecutive standardized liquid meal tests (64% carbohydrate, 22% fat, and 14% protein) during which a primed infusion of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi> was administered for 120 min at the following doses: 0, 2.5, 5, and 10 micro g. kg fat-free mass (FFM)(-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>h(-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Areas under the curve for early (AUC(0-30 min)) and total (AUC(0-120 min)) postprandial insulin and PP secretory responses were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Early postprandial insulin and PP secretory responses were higher in Pima Indians compared with those of Caucasians (both P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Secretion of insulin and PP was inhibited by <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi> (both P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increasing doses of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi> attenuated the ethnic difference in PP (P = 0.01) but not in early insulin secretory responses (P = 0.6), an effect that was not due to differences in gastric emptying rate (acetaminophen test) and/or circulating <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similar results were observed for total secretory responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results confirm that compared with Caucasians, Pima Indians have an exaggerated PNS drive to pancreatic F-cells that secrete PP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> of this population does not appear to be due to increased vagal input to pancreatic beta-cells </plain></SENT>
