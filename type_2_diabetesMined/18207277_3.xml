<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To examine association between 7-ketocholesterol and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, and other coronary risk factors, we developed a reliable quantitative method to measure serum 7-ketocholesterol (s-7KCHO) and studied s-7KCHO in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The s-7KCHO was detected by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The s-7KCHO was significantly higher in patients with T2DM (n=137, 33.8 ng/ml) compared to non-diabetic healthy subjects (n=89, 16.1 ng/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with T2DM were divided into two groups with two or more than two risk factors (defined as multiple risk factors group) and with zero or one risk factor (non-multiple risk factors group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The s-7KCHO was significantly higher in multiple risk factors group (39.5 ng/ml) compared to non-multiple risk factors (30.1 ng/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among patients with multiple risk factors group, s-7KCHO was significantly higher in patients with high <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>) levels (45.1+/-5.9 ng/ml) compared to those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> levels (35.3+/-7.0 ng/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, s-7KCHO increased according to the number of concurrent coronary risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that serum 7-ketocholesterol levels may depend on the multiple risk factors and serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
