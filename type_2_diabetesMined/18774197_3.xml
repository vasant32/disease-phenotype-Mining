<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In order to investigate the underlying mechanism of alterations in bone mineral metabolism in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we determined circulating levels of bone functional markers along with urinary excretion of sorbitol (SOR) and bone mineral density (BMD), and also examined their mutual interrelationship </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 151 male type 2 diabetic patients were examined in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight age-matched male healthy subjects were also studied as the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A significant reduction of serum intact osteocalcin (i-OC) was found in the diabetic groups (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, circulating levels of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15193,50562">tartrate</z:chebi> resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) in the diabetic patients were significantly higher than those in the controls (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, a significantly negative relationship was observed between BMD and serum TRAP (p&lt;0.01), although no significant relationship was noted between BMD and serum i-OC in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Urinary excretion of SOR was significantly elevated in the diabetic patients when compared with the controls (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, a significantly positive correlation was observed between serum TRAP and urinary SOR (p&lt;0.01), but not between serum i-OC and urinary SOR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Elevated serum TRAP in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was reduced after the administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15693">aldose</z:chebi> reductase inhibitor (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It seems most likely that the increase in osteoclastic function probably due to accelerated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26191">polyol</z:chebi> pathway plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of <z:mp ids='MP_0010124'>decreased bone mineral content</z:mp> in male patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
