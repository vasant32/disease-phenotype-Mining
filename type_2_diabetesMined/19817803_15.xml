<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In fact, the zinc level in pancreatic islets is amongst the highest in the body and reduction in its levels in the pancreas has been associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>High concentrations of zinc can also be toxic because of enhanced oxidative damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The link between zinc, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and islet dysfunction has recently been reiterated by genomewide association studies that identified an islet cell membrane zinc transporter, SLC30A8 (ZnT8), as one of the risk loci for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
