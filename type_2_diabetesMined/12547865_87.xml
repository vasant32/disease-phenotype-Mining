<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We examined whether regional adipose tissue distribution, specifically that of skeletal muscle fat and visceral abdominal fat aggregation, is characteristic of elderly individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo>, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 2,964 elderly men and women (mean age 73.6 years) were recruited for cross-sectional comparisons of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, generalized <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and regional body fat distribution with computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS-Approximately one-third of men with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and less than half of women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (BMI &gt; or =30 kg/m(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite similar amounts of subcutaneous thigh fat, intermuscular fat was higher in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and IGT than in subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (NGT) (11.2 +/- 9.4, 10.3 +/- 5.8, and 9.2 +/- 5.9 cm(2) for men; 12.1 +/- 6.1, 10.9 +/- 6.5, and 9.4 +/- 5.3 cm(2) for women; both P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Visceral abdominal fat was also higher in men and women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and IGT than in subjects with NGT (172 +/- 79, 163 +/- 72, and 145 +/- 66 cm(2) for men; 162 +/- 66, 141 +/- 60, and 116 +/- 54 cm(2) for women; both P &lt; 0.0001 across groups) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Higher rates of intermuscular fat and visceral abdominal fat were associated with higher fasting insulin in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-weight (BMI &lt;25 kg/m(2)) men (r = 0.24 for intermuscular fat, r = 0.37 for visceral abdominal fat, both P &lt; 0.0001) and women (r = 0.20 for intermuscular fat, r = 0.40 for visceral abdominal fat, both P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These associations were not found in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Elderly men and women with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> body weight may be at risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0005266'>metabolic abnormalities</z:mp>, including type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, if they possess an inordinate amount of muscle fat or visceral abdominal fat </plain></SENT>
