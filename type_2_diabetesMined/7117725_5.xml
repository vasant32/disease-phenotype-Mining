<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The increase in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> was related to the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 28 patients whose weight decreased by greater than or equal to 10% average body weight during the 6 months, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> rose from 1.22 +/- 0.06 to 1.36 +/- 0.06 mmol/l (p less than 0.001), whereas patients who lost less weight showed no significant increase in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The increase in mean serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> levels in female patients was associated with a mean weight reduction of 12.1% average body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients who were <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> at diagnosis lost more weight during the study than non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients (mean 13.2 versus 5.6% average body weight), and showed a significant increase in serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that intensive dietary therapy may lead to a less atherogenic <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile in Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, particularly in patients who achieve a major weight reduction </plain></SENT>
