<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the field of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and exercise, among the epidemiological studies of physical exercise, recent mega-trials such as the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Prevention Program (DPP) in the U.S. have shown that lifestyle intervention programs involving diet and/or exercise reduce the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In studies examining the endocrinological and metabolic effects of exercise, it has been demonstrated that physical exercise promotes the utilization of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and free fatty acids in muscles and lowers blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels in well-controlled diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Long-term, mild, regular jogging increases the action of insulin in both carbohydrate and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism without influencing body mass index or maximal oxygen uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A significant correlation has been observed between delta MCR (Deltainsulin sensitivity) and the average number of steps performed in a day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our recent data suggested that the improved effectiveness of insulin that occurs as a result of physical exercise is attributable, at least in part, to increases in GLUT4 protein, IRS1 and PI3-kinase protein in skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As a prescription for exercise, aerobic exercise of mild to moderate intensity, including walking and jogging, 10-30 min a day, 3-5 days a week, is recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Resistance training of mild intensity with the use of light dumbbells and stretch cords should be combined in elderly individuals who have decreased muscle strength </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An active lifestyle is essential in the management of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, which is one of typical lifestyle-related diseases </plain></SENT>
