<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe and analyze the time course of medical care costs caused by type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, from the time of diagnosis through the first 8 postdiagnostic years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: From electronic health maintenance organization (HMO) records, we ascertained the ongoing medical care costs for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> members with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were newly diagnosed between 1988 and 1995 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To isolate incremental costs (costs caused by the diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>), we subtracted the costs of individually matched HMO members without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from costs of members with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The economic burden of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is immediately apparent from the time of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In year 1, total medical costs were 2.1 times higher for patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with those without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp>-associated incremental costs (type 2 diabetic costs minus matched costs for people without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) averaged $2,257 per type 2 diabetic patient per year during the first 8 postdiagnostic years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Annual incremental costs varied relatively little over the period but were higher during years 1, 7, and 8 because of higher-cost hospitalizations for causes other than <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or its complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: For the first 8 years after <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosis, patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incurred substantially higher costs than matched nondiabetic patients, but those high costs remained largely flat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Once the growth in costs due to general aging is controlled for, it appears that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> do not increase incremental costs as early as is commonly believed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additional research is needed to better understand how <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and its diagnosis affect medical care costs over longer periods of time </plain></SENT>
