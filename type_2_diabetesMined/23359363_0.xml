<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the effect of blocking endogenous GLP-1 action on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance in subjects with sustained remission of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2DM) present before RYGBP.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSBlood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, glucagon, GLP-1, and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent insulinotropic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels were measured after a meal challenge with either exendin-(9-39) (a GLP-1r antagonist) or saline infusion in eight subjects with sustained remission of T2DM after RYGBP and seven healthy controls.RESULTSInfusion of exendin-(9-39) resulted in marginal deterioration of the 2-h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> after meal intake in RYGBP subjects (saline 78.4 ± 15.1 mg/dL compared with exendin-(9-39) 116.5 ± 22.3 mg/dL; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> response to meal intake was similarly enlarged in the two study groups (percent change in the area under the curve of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> exendin-(9-39)-infusion versus saline-infusion: controls 10.84 ± 8.8% versus RYGBP 9.94 ± 8.4%; P = 0.884) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the RYGBP group, the blockade of the enlarged GLP-1 response to meal intake resulted in reduced insulin (P = 0.001) and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.001), but no change in glucagon (P = 0.258) responses.CONCLUSIONThe limited deterioration of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance on blockade of GLP-1 action in our study suggests the resolution of T2DM after RYGBP may be explained by mechanisms beyond enhancement of GLP-1 action </plain></SENT>
