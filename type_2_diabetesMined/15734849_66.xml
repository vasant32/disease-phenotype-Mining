<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To shed further light on the primary alterations of insulin secretion in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the possible mechanisms involved, we studied several functional and molecular properties of islets isolated from the pancreata of 13 type 2 diabetic and 13 matched nondiabetic cadaveric organ donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion from type 2 diabetic islets was significantly lower than from control islets, whereas arginine- and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin release was less markedly affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The defects were accompanied by reduced <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of GLUT1 and -2 and glucokinase and by diminished <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> oxidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase activation was reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the expression of insulin was decreased, and that of pancreatic duodenal homeobox-1 (PDX-1) and forkhead box O1 (Foxo-1) was increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nitrotyrosine and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine concentrations, markers of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, were significantly higher in type 2 diabetic than control islets, and they were correlated with the degree of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin release impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, 24-h exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> significantly improved <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin release and decreased nitrotyrosine concentration, with partial recovery of insulin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results provide direct evidence that the defects of insulin secretion in type 2 diabetic islets are associated with multiple islet cell alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most importantly, the current study shows that the functional impairment of type 2 diabetic islets can be, at least in part, reversible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this regard, it is suggested that reducing islet cell <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> is a potential target of human type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> therapy </plain></SENT>
