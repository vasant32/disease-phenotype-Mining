<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine whether <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance varies throughout the day in people with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied 15 healthy IGT, and 18 matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerant (NGT) individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were taken every 30-120 min during a 24h period in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> individuals had three mixed meals and nocturnal sleep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We measured <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, free fatty acids, specific insulin, intact proinsulin, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> and growth hormone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Variable responses were considered as concentrations and areas under the curves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparison between the groups was by Student's t-test, Mann-Whitney, and analysis of variance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Higher total <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> response, inappropriate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> total insulin response, and unproportionally increased proinsulin total response were observed in the IGT group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lower <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance occurred in IGT after dinner, as in the NGT, and after breakfast associated with increased insulin response after breakfast, and similar proinsulin response after <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three meals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IGT had higher <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> response than NGT after breakfast and lunch, similar insulin responses, and increased proinsulin-insulin ratio after <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three meals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Data from this study demonstrate that IGT individuals present lower <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance in the evening, as those with NGT, and in the morning, as reported in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
