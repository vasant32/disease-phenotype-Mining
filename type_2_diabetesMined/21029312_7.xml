<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that long-chain saturated NEFAs exhibit a strong cytotoxic effect upon insulin-producing cells, while short-chain as well as unsaturated NEFAs are well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, long-chain unsaturated NEFAs counteract the toxicity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15756">palmitic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and gene expression analyses together with viability assays in different β-cell lines showed that the G-protein-coupled receptors 40 and 120 do not mediate lipotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This is independent from the role, which these receptors, specifically GPR40, play in the potentiation of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced insulin secretion by saturated and unsaturated long-chain NEFAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Long-chain NEFAs are not only metabolized in the mitochondria but also in peroxisomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> β-oxidation, the acyl-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="15346">coenzyme A</z:chebi> (CoA) oxidases in the peroxisomes form <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> and not reducing equivalents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As β-cells almost completely lack catalase, they are exceptionally vulnerable to <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> generated in peroxisomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ROS generation in the respiratory chain is less important because overexpression of catalase and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase in the mitochondria do not provide protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, peroxisomally generated <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> is the likely ROS that causes pancreatic β-cell dysfunction and ultimately β-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
