<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Examination of pancreata from age matched organ donors with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (DM) treated by incretin therapy (n=8) or other therapy (n=12) and non diabetic controls (n=14) reveals a ∼40% increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0877425" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pancreatic mass</z:e> in DM treated with incretin therapy with both increased exocrine cell proliferation (p&lt;0.0001) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (increased pancreatic intraepithelia <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pancreas in DM treated with incretin therapy was notable for α cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> and glucagon expressing microadenomas (3/8) and a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_366'>neuroendocrine tumor</z:mpath>. β cell mass was reduced by approximately 60% in those with DM, yet a 6 fold increase was observed in incretin treated subjects although <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> persists </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, in humans, incretin therapy resulted in a marked expansion of the exocrine and <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> pancreatic compartments, the former being accompanied by increased proliferation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, the latter by α cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> with the potential for evolution into <z:mpath ids='MPATH_366'>neuroendocrine tumors</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
