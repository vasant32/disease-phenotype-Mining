<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lesser degrees of abnormal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism including impaired fasting glycaemia and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> are also associated with increased cardiovascular risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Studies showing improved cardiovascular outcomes with oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> agents are limited, with the UKPDS demonstrating improved macrovascular outcomes only in a subgroup of <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, and the heavily criticized STOP <z:mp ids='MP_0002057'>NIDDM</z:mp> trial showing a reduction in the number of cardiovascular events with the alpha glucosidase inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In recent years there has been an increase in the number of oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs available to treat the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Some of these drugs have complex metabolic properties, additional to their antihyperglycaemic effect, improving endothelial function and markers of atherogenesis, with the potential to reduce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301700" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular morbidity</z:e> and mortality, as supported by the recently published results of the PROACTIVE study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results of further long-term cardiovascular outcome studies with these newer agents are awaited </plain></SENT>
