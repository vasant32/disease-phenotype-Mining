<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Problem solving is a core aspect of effective <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> illness self-management, yet there are relatively few objective evaluations of problem-solving skills, especially in large, multiracial samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A multiracial sample of 506 adults who have type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were assessed on a variety of patient characteristics, self-management behaviors, and biological and psychosocial measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They also completed the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Problem-Solving Interview (DPSI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: DPSI scores revealed significant variability across patients in problem-solving skill and were related to a number of comorbid conditions and complications but not to several other demographic factors, including race/ethnicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Problem solving was also related to self-management behaviors (eating and exercise patterns), biological variables (A1C and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>), and psychosocial measures (<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Distress Scale) in multivariable analyses controlling for a variety of potential confounding factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> problem solving, as measured by the DPSI, is an important patient skill related to several key <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> management variables that appears applicable across racial and ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Future research is needed to identify the generality versus specificity of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> problem solving and practical interventions to enhance problem-solving skills </plain></SENT>
