<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the hypothesis that plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> is associated with a reduction in episodic and/or semantic memory already in nondiabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We linked two large population-based datasets in Sweden: the Betula study, in which a random sample from the population aged 35-85 years was investigated for cognitive function, including episodic and semantic memory; and the VÃ¤sterbotten Intervention Program, a health survey with subjects aged 40, 50, and 60 years, that includes measuring of fasting and 2-h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, along with other risk factors for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We identified 411 (179 men and 232 women, mean age 50.6 +/- 8.0 years) nondiabetic subjects, free from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, who had participated in the two surveys within 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Women had better episodic (score 7.37 +/- 1.42) and semantic memory (score 16.05 +/- 2.76) than men (score 6.59 +/- 1.29 and 15.15 +/- 2.92, respectively, P &lt; 0.001 for both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In an adjusted multivariate model, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (fPG) and 2-h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (2hPG) were significantly negatively associated with episodic memory (fPG: B -0.198, SE 0.068, beta -0.209, P = 0.004; and 2hPG: B -0.061, SE 0.031, beta -0.148, P = 0.048, respectively) in women but not in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The association was not found in relation to semantic memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that an increase in plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> is associated with impairment in episodic memory in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This could be explained by a negative effect on the hippocampus caused by raised plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
