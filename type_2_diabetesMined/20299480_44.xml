<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether use of oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi> is associated with an altered <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> risk in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using the U.K.-based General Practice Research Database, we conducted a nested case-control analysis among 22,621 female users of oral antidiabetes drugs with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated whether they had an altered risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> in relation to use of various types of oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Case and control patients with a recorded diagnosis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were matched on age, calendar time, and general practice, and the multivariate conditional logistic regression analyses were further adjusted for use of oral antidiabetes drugs, insulin, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50114">estrogens</z:chebi>, smoking BMI, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration, and HbA1c (A1C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 305 case patients with a recorded incident diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean +/- SD age was 67.5 +/- 10.5 years at the time of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Long-term use of &gt;or=40 prescriptions (&gt;5 years) of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, based on 17 exposed case patients and 120 exposed control patients, was associated with an adjusted odds ratio of 0.44 (95% CI 0.24-0.82) for developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> compared with no use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neither short-term <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> use nor use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> or other antidiabetes drugs was associated with a materially altered risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A decreased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> was observed in female patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> on a long-term basis </plain></SENT>
