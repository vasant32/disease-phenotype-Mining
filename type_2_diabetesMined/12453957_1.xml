<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Elevated levels of HbA(1c) have been observed in younger American Indian/Alaska Native adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objectives of this study were: 1) to determine whether HbA(1c) levels were elevated among younger American Indian/Alaska Native adults nationally and, if so, 2) to determine the relationship between HbA(1c) levels and age due to treatment type, BMI, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal disease</z:e>, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, survival, or a poor <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> health care index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The national Indian Health Service <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Care and Outcomes Audit was completed for a total of 11,419 American Indian/Alaska Native adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from tribes across the U.S. in 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> control was assessed by HbA(1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BMI, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration, treatment type, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> were assessed from the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Care and Outcomes Audit data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To assess <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> quality of care, an index was developed from six standard of care <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Care and Outcomes Audit variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found HbA(1c) level decreased with increasing age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HbA(1c) levels were 9.2, 8.9, 8.8, 8.3, and 7.8 for ages 18-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, and &gt; or =70 years, respectively (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This inverse relationship was not accounted for by differences in BMI, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration, treatment type, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo>, or health care index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among American Indian/Alaska Native adults, HbA(1c) levels were highest in the youngest age-group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>With increasing numbers of young American Indian/Alaska Native adults with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, poorer <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control is expected to bring concomitant increased morbidity and mortality unless more effective and efficient interventions are developed to improve <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control among young American Indian/Alaska Native adults </plain></SENT>
