<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether the SLC2A10 gene could be a type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility gene in the Taiwanese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Sequencing of SLC2A10 gene from 48 diabetic subjects detected short tandem repeat polymorphisms in the promoter region, but did not detect any other sequence variants or new single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) other than those already in the SNPper database ( http://snpper.chip.org ) (30 June 2005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Using these genetic polymorphisms, we divided the SLC2A10 gene into four distinct linkage disequilibrium blocks and performed a case-control association study in a group of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> subjects (n = 375) and normoglycaemic individuals (n=377) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The HapD (A-G-T-C) haplotype in block 3, a rare haplotype, which consisted of four SNPs (rs3092412, rs2235491, rs2425904 and rs1059217), was modestly associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with a haplotype score of -2.95567 (p = 0.012 with the haplotype-specific test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that SLC2A10 genetic variations do not appear to be major determinants for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility in the Taiwanese population </plain></SENT>
