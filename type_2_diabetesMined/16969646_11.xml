<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to study whether the -374 T/A polymorphism in the gene encoding RAGE (AGER) is associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> type and presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The AGER -374 T/A polymorphism was genotyped in 867 type 1 diabetic patients, 2,467 type 2 diabetic patients and 205 non-diabetic control subjects of Scandinavian origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: AGER polymorphism was related to different HLA-DQB1 genotypes and the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Type 1 diabetic patients had a higher frequency of the AGER -374 A/A or T/A genotypes than type 2 diabetic patients (51.1 vs 44.9%, p=0.002) and control subjects (51.1 vs 47.6%, p=0.0006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The RAGE -374 T/A polymorphism was associated with HLA-DQB1 genotypes; patients with HLA risk genotypes had a higher frequency of the A/A or T/A genotypes than patients with other HLA-DQB1 genotypes (60.3 vs 40.3%, p&lt;0.000001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In type 1 diabetic patients, the frequency of the A/A or T/A genotypes was higher in patients with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> than without (61.1 vs 46.8%, p=0.006) and with sight-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> than without (56.1 vs 47.6%, p=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In type 2 diabetic patients with HbA(1c) values below the median, the T/T genotype was more frequent in patients with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> than without (54.3 vs 38.2%, p=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our results show an association between the AGER -374 T/A polymorphism and type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This association was HLA-DQB1-dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The polymorphism was associated with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in both type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, in an HbA(1c)-dependent manner in the latter group, and also with sight-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> in type 1 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
