<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our studies indicate that iPLA(2)beta is expressed in beta-cells and participates in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion but is not involved in membrane <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>If iPLA(2)beta plays a signaling role in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion, then conditions that impair iPLA(2)beta functions might contribute to the diminished capacity of beta-cells to secrete insulin in response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, which is a prominent characteristic of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our recent studies suggest that iPLA(2)beta might also participate in beta-cell proliferation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and that various <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-derived mediators are involved in these processes </plain></SENT>
