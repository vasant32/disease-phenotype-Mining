<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Vasculoprotective endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are regulated by stromal-derived factor-1alpha (SDF-1alpha) and are reduced in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because SDF-1alpha is a substrate of dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 (DPP-4), we investigated whether the DPP-4 inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> modulates EPC levels in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a controlled, nonrandomized clinical trial comparing 4-week <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> (n = 16) versus no additional treatment (n = 16) in addition to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and/or secretagogues in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We determined circulating EPC levels and plasma concentrations of SDF-1alpha, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrites</z:chebi>/nitrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no difference in clinical baseline data between the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> and control arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 4 weeks, as compared with control subjects, patients receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> showed a significant increase in EPCs and SDF-1alpha and a decrease in <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">Sitagliptin</z:chebi> increases circulating EPCs in type 2 diabetic patients with concomitant upregulation of SDF-1alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This ancillary effect of DPP-4 inhibition might have potential favorable cardiovascular implications </plain></SENT>
