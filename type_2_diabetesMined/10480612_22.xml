<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effects of pregnancy and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transport activity and the expression and phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 in human skeletal muscle fiber strips in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rectus abdominis muscle biopsies were obtained at the time of cesarean section from 11 pregnant women with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (pregnant control), 7 pregnant women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e>, and 11 nonpregnant women undergoing elective surgery (nonpregnant control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects were matched for age and similar degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rate of maximal insulin (10(-7) mol/l)-stimulated 2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15866">deoxyglucose</z:chebi> transport was reduced by 32% (P &lt; 0.05) in muscle strips from the pregnant control group and even further in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> subjects by 54% (P &lt; 0.05 vs. pregnant control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The maximal effect of insulin on tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor was 37% lower (P &lt; 0.05) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> subjects than in pregnant control subjects and was not related to changes in the abundance of the insulin receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with nonpregnant control subjects, maximal insulin-stimulated IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation was significantly lower by 59 +/- 24% (mean +/- SD) (P &lt; 0.05) and 62 +/- 28% (P &lt; 0.05) in pregnant control and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> subjects, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This was reflected by a 23% (P &lt; 0.05) and 44% (P &lt; 0.002) reduction in IRS-1 protein levels in muscle from pregnant control and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both pregnant control and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> subjects exhibited a 1.5- to 2-fold increase in the levels of IRS-2 (P &lt; 0.01) and p85alpha regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase (P &lt; 0.05), despite reduced <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transport activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transport during pregnancy is uniquely associated with a decrease in IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation, primarily due to decreased expression of IRS-1 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> subjects, a decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor beta-subunit is associated with further decreases in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transport activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, impaired insulin receptor autophosphorylation is an important early distinction underlying muscle <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in young women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e>, and it may underlie future risk for the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
