<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Reports have shown that visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is more closely linked to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> (CRFs) than subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to elucidate preferential abdominal fat loss and the correlations between abdominal fat reductions and changes in CRFs achieved with a moderate low-carbohydrate diet (LCD) in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-two outpatients (28 men and 24 women, mean age ± SD: 60.0 ± 10.5 years) with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c) (HbA(lc)) levels ≥ 6.5% were on an LCD for 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Over a 6-month period, we measured their abdominal fat distribution (using CT) and assessed CRFs, including body mass index (BMI), HbA(1c), fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FBG), serum insulin, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patients showed good compliance with the LCD (1812 ± 375 kcal/day, % carbohydrate:fat:protein = 35:40:19 for men; 1706 ± 323 kcal/day, % carbohydrate:fat:protein = 41:36:21 for women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significant decreases (P = 0.05) in BMI and HbA(1c) levels were observed, along with an increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> (P = 0.021) in men and a decrease in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> (P = 0.001) in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>VAT (-21.6 cm(2), P &lt; 0.001 in men; -19.6 cm(2), P &lt; 0.001 in women) and SAT (-13.5 cm(2), P = 0.004 in men; -19.1 cm(2), P = 0.003 in women) significantly decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The loss of VAT (%ΔVAT) was greater than that of SAT (%ΔSAT) in women (P = 0.022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A similar but not significant predominance of VAT loss was detected in men (P = 0.111) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In women, the %ΔSAT significantly correlated with changes in FBG (ΔFBG) (r = 0.417) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> (Δ<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>) (r = -0.720), as was %ΔVAT with changes in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> (ΔTG) (r = 0.591) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Six months of a moderate LCD resulted in preferential VAT loss only in women, with significant correlations between %ΔSAT and both Δ<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> and ΔFBG, as well as between %ΔVAT and ΔTG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that an LCD has the potential to reduce abdominal fat in patients with T2DM and deterioration of serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profiles </plain></SENT>
