<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35692">Dicarboxylic acids</z:chebi> are <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33243">natural products</z:chebi> with the potential of being an alternate dietary source of energy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to evaluate the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41865">sebacic acid</z:chebi> (a 10-carbon <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35692">dicarboxylic acid</z:chebi>; C10) ingestion on postprandial glycemia and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> rate of appearance (Ra) in healthy and type 2 diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the effect of C10 on insulin-mediated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake and on GLUT4 expression was assessed in L6 muscle cells in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Subjects ingested a mixed meal (50% carbohydrates, 15% proteins, and 35% <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>) containing 0 g (control) or 10 g C10 in addition to the meal or 23 g C10 as a substitute of fats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In type 2 diabetic subjects, the incremental <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> area under the curve (AUC) decreased by 42% (P&lt;0.05) and 70% (P&lt;0.05) in the 10 g C10 and 23 g C10 groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the largest amounts used, C10 reduced the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> AUC in healthy volunteers also </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When fats were substituted with 23 g C10, AUC of Ra was significantly reduced on the order of 18% (P&lt;0.05) in both healthy and diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The insulin-dependent <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake by L6 cells was increased in the presence of C10 (38.7±10.3 vs. 11.4±5.4%; P=0.026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This increase was associated with a 1.7-fold raise of GLUT4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41865">Sebacic acid</z:chebi> significantly reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> after a meal in type 2 diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This beneficial effect was associated with a reduction in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> Ra, probably due to lowered hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> output and increased peripheral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal </plain></SENT>
