<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Young adults with newly diagnosed apparent type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> present the clinician with a wide differential diagnosis of possible etiology, including autoimmune and genetic causes as well as young-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (YT2D) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The characteristics of these groups have been described, but it is not known in which subjects investigation for etiology may be beneficial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 268 unselected U.K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Caucasian subjects diagnosed at ages 18-45 years and not treated with permanent insulin for &lt; or =6 months were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects underwent clinical assessment and screening for GAD antibodies (GADA) and tyrosine phosphatase IA-2 antibodies (IA-2A) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Screening for a common mutation in the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alpha (HNF-1 alpha) gene and the common <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> mutation was performed in the antibody-negative subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subjects without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> were selected for sequencing of the HNF-1 alpha gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A specific etiology was defined in 11.6% of the 268 subjects and in 24.7% of the lean subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six subjects (9.7%) were positive for a beta-cell antibody, one subject had familial partial <z:hpo ids='HP_0009125'>lipodystrophy</z:hpo> and the lamin A/C mutation R482W, and two subjects had the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> mutation A3243G </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two of 15 selected subjects had HNF-1 alpha mutations, the novel missense mutation A501T, and the previously reported R583Q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This unselected series shows that there is considerable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in apparent YT2D. beta-Cell autoantibodies should be performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> those presenting at ages 18-45 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Genetic investigations can be targeted to phenotypically defined subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The finding of a specific etiology will allow individualization of management and give patients valuable information about their condition </plain></SENT>
