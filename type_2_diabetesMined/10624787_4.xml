<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp>, defined as the albumin:<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio &gt; or = 2.5 (for males) or &gt; or = 3.5 mg/mmol (for females), was 13.4% in Type 1 DM, 69.5% in insulin-requiring Type 2 DM and 16% in Type 2 DM treated only with oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Compared to those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> renal functions, these patients were older (P &lt; or = 0.01), had significantly elevated blood pressures (P &lt; 0.01 or P = 0.0001), and in the case of Type 1 DM, with a higher body mass index (P = 0.0001) and waist-hip ratio (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> in Type 1 DM was found to increase with the duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, from 1.4% in the newly-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (&lt; 5 years), to 9.9% in those with 5-10 years disease, to 35% among patients with more than 10 years of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, it was also observed that 10% of the Type 2 DM patients already had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> within 5 years of diagnosis, and the prevalence increased significantly to 42.9% (P &lt; 0.0001) among patients who had been diabetics for more than 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that besides the disease duration, systolic blood pressure was the most common and significant determinant for both <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> in both types of DM, thus implying that in order to reduce the risk of microvascular complications in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, systolic and not just the diastolic blood pressure, should be effectively controlled </plain></SENT>
