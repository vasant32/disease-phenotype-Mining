<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The latter could constitute a problem for clinical trial design because the vast majority of subjects with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have type 2 (non-insulin dependent) <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was aimed at characterization of PDN in leptin-deficient (ob/ob) mice, a model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with relatively mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>. ob/ob mice ( approximately 11 weeks old) clearly developed manifest sciatic motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV) and hind-limb digital sensory nerve conduction velocity (SNCV) deficits, <z:mp ids='MP_0001973'>thermal hypoalgesia</z:mp>, tactile <z:mp ids='MP_0003177'>allodynia</z:mp>, and a remarkable ( approximately 78%) loss of intraepidermal nerve fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They also had increased sorbitol pathway activity in the sciatic nerve and increased nitrotyrosine and poly(<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi>) immunofluorescence in the sciatic nerve, spinal cord, and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sciatic nerve nitrotyrosine immunofluorescence and the number of poly(<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi>)-positive nuclei in sciatic nerve, spinal cord, and DRGs of fidarestat-treated ob/ob mice did not differ from those in nondiabetic controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the leptin-deficient ob/ob mouse is a new animal model that develops both large motor and sensory fiber and small sensory fiber PDN and responds to pathogenetic treatment </plain></SENT>
