<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have shown that adipose tissue 11beta-HSD1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> and insulinaemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we conducted further expression and genetic association studies in Pima Indians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The 11beta-HSD1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> concentrations were measured in abdominal subcutaneous adipocytes (n=61) and skeletal muscle tissues (n=64) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the HSD11B1 gene were genotyped in a larger group of full-blooded Pima Indians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two representative SNPs (SNP1, n=706; SNP5, n=839) were associated with Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (p=0.01), although neither SNP was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, SNP1 (n=127) and SNP5 (n=159) were associated with insulin-mediated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake rates (p=0.03 and p=0.04), and SNP1 was further associated with fasting, 30-min, and 2-h plasma insulin concentrations (p=0.002, p=0.002 and p=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adipocyte 11beta-HSD1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> concentrations were correlated positively with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> and insulinaemia, and were additionally negatively correlated with insulin-mediated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake rates; nevertheless, the adipocyte 11beta-HSD1 expression did not correlate with genotypes of the donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The muscle 11beta-HSD1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> concentrations did not correlate with any anthropometric or metabolic variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We confirmed that adipocyte 11beta-HSD1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> concentrations were associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e>, and showed that genetic variations in the HSD11B1 gene were associated with Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, plasma insulin concentrations and insulin action, independent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The variable adipose expression might not be a primary consequence of these HSD11B1 SNPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is possible that the HSD11B1 gene is under tissue-specific regulation, and has tissue-specific consequences </plain></SENT>
