<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Many patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> fail to achieve treatment targets recommended in recognized guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little data is available in this area relating to young adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess whether treatment goals for glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA(1c)), blood pressure, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering, and process outcomes for microvascular screening are being achieved in young adults with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective clinical record audit of 202 consecutive patients with type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, aged predominantly 18-45 years, attending a specialist <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> center in Brisbane, Australia, was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Assessment was made as to whether goals for HbA(1c), blood pressure, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> lowering, and microvascular screening were being achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Descriptive statistics and comparison of continuous variables were produced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean (SD) HbA(1c) was 8.30% (±1.5) with no statistical difference between patients with type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P = 0.44) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sixteen percent of patients (12% type 1, 31% type 2) had an HbA(1c) of &lt; 7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eighty-three percent of patients had blood pressure ≤130/80 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sixteen percent of patients with type 1 and 37% with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were achieving combined <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only 34% and 9% of patients who had an indication (and no documented contraindication) for <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering and antiplatelet therapy, respectively, were prescribed such agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was a significant difference in achievement of macrovascular treatment targets in patients with type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but no difference in screening or treatment outcomes in microvascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients below the age of 25 years were less likely to achieve macrovascular treatment targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A large number of young adult patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> do not achieve recognized treatment targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There appears to be less emphasis placed on macrovascular risk factor targets compared with previous audits in older patients, in patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and in patients younger than 25 years </plain></SENT>
