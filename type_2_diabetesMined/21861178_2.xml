<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17158">Methylglyoxal</z:chebi> (MGO) is the most reactive AGE precursor and its abnormal accumulation participates in damage in various tissues and organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we investigated the ability of MGO to interfere with insulin signalling and to affect beta cell functions in the INS-1E beta cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: INS-1E cells were incubated with MGO and then exposed to insulin or to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Western blotting was used to study signalling pathways, and real-time PCR to analyse gene expression; insulin levels were determined by radioimmunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Non-cytotoxic MGO concentrations inhibited insulin-induced IRS tyrosine phosphorylation and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (PKB) pathway activation independently from reactive oxygen species (ROS) production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Concomitantly, formation of AGE adducts on immunoprecipitated IRS was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="40618">Aminoguanidine</z:chebi> reversed MGO inhibitory effects and the formation of AGE adducts on IRS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further, the insulin- and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced expression of Ins1, Gck and Pdx1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was abolished by MGO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, MGO blocked <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced insulin secretion and PI3K/PKB pathway activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These MGO effects were abolished by <z:chebi fb="5" ids="48607">LiCl</z:chebi>, which inhibits <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: MGO exerted major damaging effects on INS-1E cells impairing both insulin action and secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>An important actor in these noxious MGO effects appears to be GSK-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, MGO participates not only in the pathogenesis of the debilitating complications of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but also in worsening of the diabetic state by favouring beta cell failure </plain></SENT>
