<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of our study was to identify chromosomal regions that are likely to harbor genetic determinants of these traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a series of genetic analyses, including genome-wide and fine-mapping linkage studies, based on insulin levels measured during an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) in 552 nondiabetic participants in the Amish Family <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Indices of insulin secretion included the insulinogenic index and insulin at 30 min postglucose load (insulin 30), while indices of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> included homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-IR) and fasting insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Insulin area under the curve, a measure of both insulin secretion and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, was also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> traits were modestly heritable, with heritability estimates ranging from 0.1 to 0.4 (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was significant genetic correlation between fasting insulin and HOMA-IR (rho(G) &gt; 0.86, P &lt; 0.05), as well as insulin 30 and insulinogenic index (rho(G) = 0.81, P &lt; 0.0001), suggesting that common genes influence variation in these pairs of traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Suggestive linkage signals in the genome scan were to insulin 30 on chromosome 15q23 (logarithm of odds [LOD] 2.53, P = 0.00032) and to insulinogenic index on chromosome 2p13 (LOD 2.51, P = 0.00034) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fine-mapping study further refined our signal for insulin 30 on chromosome 15 (LOD 2.38 at 68 cM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that there may be different genes influencing variation in OGTT measures of insulin secretion and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
