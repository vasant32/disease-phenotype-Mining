<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The translational research portfolio that originally described these risk factors was significantly enhanced by imaging techniques, such as dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this article, we briefly review the important contributions of these techniques to understand the role of body composition in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-related complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Notably, these imaging techniques have contributed greatly to recent findings identifying gender and racial differences in body composition and patterns of body composition change during <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although these techniques have the ability to generate good-quality body composition data, each possesses limitations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For example, DEXA is unable to differentiate type of fat, CT has better resolution but provides greater ionizing radiation exposure, and MRI tends to require longer imaging times and specialized equipment for acquisition and analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With the serious need for efficacious and cost-effective therapies to appropriately identify and treat at-risk <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals, there is greater need for translational tools that can further elucidate the interplay between body composition and the metabolic aberrations associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we will offer our perspective on the evolution toward an ideal imaging method for body composition assessment in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, and the challenges remaining to achieve this goal </plain></SENT>
