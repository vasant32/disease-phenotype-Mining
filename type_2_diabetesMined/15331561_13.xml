<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The BEACON gene (also known as UBL5) was identified as differentially expressed between lean and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> Psammomys obesus, a polygenic animal model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The human homologue of BEACON is located on chromosome 19p, a region likely to contain genes affecting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e>-related quantitative traits as established by linkage studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To assess whether the human BEACON gene may be involved in influencing these traits, we exhaustively analyzed the complete gene for genetic variation in 40 unrelated individuals and identified four variants (three novel) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The two more common variants were tested for association with a number of quantitative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e>-related traits in two large cohorts of unrelated individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant associations were found between these variants and fat mass (P = 0.026), percentage of fat (P = 0.001), and waist-to-hip ratio (P = 0.031) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The same variants were also associated with total cholesterol (P = 0.024), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (P = 0.019), <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (P = 0.006), and postglucose load insulin levels (P = 0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis of these correlated phenotypes also yielded a highly significant association (P = 0.0004), suggesting that BEACON may influence phenotypic variation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e>-related traits </plain></SENT>
