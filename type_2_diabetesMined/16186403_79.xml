<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-IV inhibitors are a new approach to the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DPP-IV is a member of a family of serine peptidases that includes quiescent cell proline dipeptidase (QPP), DPP8, and DPP9; DPP-IV is a key regulator of incretin hormones, but the functions of other family members are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine the importance of selective DPP-IV inhibition for the treatment of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we tested selective inhibitors of DPP-IV, DPP8/DPP9, or QPP in 2-week rat toxicity studies and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dog tolerability studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In rats, the DPP8/9 inhibitor produced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001596'>alopecia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001896'>reticulocytopenia</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0000691'>enlarged spleen</z:mp>, multiorgan histopathological changes, and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In dogs, the DPP8/9 inhibitor produced gastrointestinal toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The QPP inhibitor produced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001896'>reticulocytopenia</z:hpo> in rats only, and no toxicities were noted in either species for the selective DPP-IV inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The DPP8/9 inhibitor was also shown to attenuate T-cell activation in human in vitro models; a selective DPP-IV inhibitor was inactive in these assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we found DPP-IV inhibitors that were previously reported to be active in models of immune function to be more potent inhibitors of DPP8/9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that assessment of selectivity of potential clinical candidates may be important to an optimal safety profile for this new class of antihyperglycemic agents </plain></SENT>
