<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate whether HLA-DQB1 genotypes facilitate the classification of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> as compared with assessment of islet antibodies by investigating young adult diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Blood samples were available at diagnosis for 1,872 (90%) of the 2,077 young adult patients (aged 15-34 years old) over a 5-year period in the nationwide <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Incidence Study in Sweden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Islet antibodies were measured at diagnosis in 1,869 patients, fasting plasma C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (fpC-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>) after diagnosis in 1,522, while HLA-DQB1 genotypes were determined in 1,743 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Islet antibodies were found in 83% of patients clinically considered to have type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 23% with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 45% with unclassifiable <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After diagnosis, median fpC-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> concentrations were markedly lower in patients with islet antibodies than in those without (0.24 vs 0.69 nmol/l, p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Irrespective of clinical classification, patients with islet antibodies showed increased frequencies of at least one of the risk-associated HLA-DQB1 genotypes compared with patients without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Antibody-negative patients with risk-associated HLA-DQB1 genotypes had significantly lower median fpC-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> concentrations than those without risk-associated genotypes (0.51 vs 0.74 nmol/l, p=0.0003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Assessment of islet antibodies is necessary for the aetiological classification of diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>HLA-DQB1 genotyping does not improve the classification in patients with islet antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, in patients without islet antibodies, HLA-DQB1 genotyping together with C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> measurement may be of value in differentiating between idiopathic type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
