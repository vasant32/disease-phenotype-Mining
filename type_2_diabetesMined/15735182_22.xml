<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both interventions were culturally competent regarding language, diet, social emphasis, family participation, and incorporating cultural beliefs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We recruited 216 persons between 35 and 70 years of age diagnosed with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> &gt;/=1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intervention groups of eight participants and eight support persons were randomly assigned to the compressed or extended conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The interventions differed in total number of contact hours over the year-long intervention period, with the major difference being the number of support group sessions held </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The same information provided in the educational sessions of the extended intervention was compressed into fewer sessions, thus providing more information during each group meeting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The interventions were not statistically different in reducing HbA(1c); however, both were effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A "dosage effect" of attendance was detected with the largest HbA(1c) reductions achieved by those who attended more of the extended intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For individuals who attended &gt;/=50% of the intervention, baseline to 12-month HbA(1c) change was -0.6 percentage points for the compressed group and -1.7 percentage points for the extended group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Both culturally competent <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-management education interventions were effective in promoting improved metabolic control and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> knowledge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A dosage effect was evident; attending more sessions resulted in greater improvements in metabolic control </plain></SENT>
