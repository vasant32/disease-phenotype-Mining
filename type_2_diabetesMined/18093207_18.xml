<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> double-blind, multicentre, randomized, placebo- or active-controlled trials conducted in drug-naïve patients with T2DM were pooled from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients receiving monotherapy with vildagliptin (100 mg daily: 50 mg twice daily or 100 mg once daily, n = 1855) or placebo (n = 347) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fasting measures of beta-cell function [homeostasis model assessment of beta-cell function (HOMA-B) and proinsulin : insulin ratio] were assessed in the overall pooled monotherapy population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Standard meal tests were performed at baseline and week 24 in a subset of patients, and effects of vildagliptin (100 mg daily, n = 227) on dynamic (meal test-derived) measures of beta-cell function [insulin secretion rate relative to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (ISR/G) and insulinogenic indices] were assessed relative to baseline and vs. placebo (n = 29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the overall population, vildagliptin significantly increased HOMA-B both relative to baseline [adjusted mean change (AMDelta) = 10.3 +/- 1.5] and vs. placebo (between-treatment difference in AMDelta = 11.5 +/- 4.5, p = 0.01) and significantly decreased the proinsulin : insulin ratio relative to baseline (AMDelta = -0.05 +/- 0.01) and vs. placebo (between-treatment difference in AMDelta = -0.09 +/- 0.02, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Relative to baseline, vildagliptin monotherapy significantly increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> meal test-derived parameters, and ISR/G (between-treatment difference in AMDelta = 9.8 +/- 2.8 pmol/min/m(2)/mM, p &lt; 0.001) and the insulinogenic index(0-peak <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>) (between-treatment difference in AMDelta = 0.24 +/- 0.05 pmol/mmol, p = 0.045) were significantly increased vs. placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Vildagliptin monotherapy consistently produced robust improvements in both fasting and meal test-derived measures of beta-cell function across a broad spectrum of drug-naïve patients with T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> Phase III trials described (NCT 00099905, NCT 00099866, NCT 00099918, NCT 00101673, NCT 00101803 and NCT 00120536) are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov </plain></SENT>
