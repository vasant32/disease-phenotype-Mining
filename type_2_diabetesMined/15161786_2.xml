<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 20 control subjects and 18 type 2 diabetic subjects with foot ulceration and 20 without were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>None of the subjects had clinical features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Computer-Aided Sensory Evaluator IV (CASE IV) was used to determine vibration detection threshold (VDT), cold detection threshold (CDT), warm detection threshold (WDT), and heat pain <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> threshold (HPO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vibration perception threshold (VPT) was also assessed by a neurothesiometer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Microvascular function (maximum hyperemia to skin heating to 44 degrees C) was assessed using laser Doppler flowmetry (mean maximum hyperemia using laser Doppler flowmeter [LDF(max)]), laser Doppler imaging (mean maximum hyperemia using laser Doppler imager [LDI(max)]), and skin oxygenation with transcutaneous oxygen tension (TcpO(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: VPT, VDT, CDT, and HPO were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significantly higher in individuals with ulceration than in those without (VPT and VDT: P &lt; 0.0001) (CDT and HPO: P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LDF(max), LDI(max), and TcpO(2) were significantly lower in the two diabetic groups than in the control subjects, but there was no difference between individuals with and without ulceration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Univariate logistic regression analysis revealed similar odds ratios for foot ulceration for VDT, CDT, HPO, and VPT (OR 1.97 [95% CI 1.30-2.98], 1.58 [1.20-2.08], 2.30 [1.21-4.37], and 1.24 [1.08-1.42], respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>None of the microvascular parameters yielded significant odds ratios for ulceration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study found that there was no additional value in measuring small-fiber function with the CASE IV over measuring vibration by either CASE IV or the inexpensive neurothesiometer in discriminating between individuals with and without ulceration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, none of the tests of microvascular function including the TcpO(2) were able to discriminate between individuals with and without ulceration, suggesting that such tests may not be of benefit in identifying subjects at greater risk of foot ulceration </plain></SENT>
