<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to validate this finding in a Chinese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We genotyped four SNPs, rs2074196, rs2237892, rs2237895 and rs2237897, in a group of 3,503 Shanghai Chinese individuals, comprising 1,769 type 2 diabetic patients and 1,734 normoglycaemic controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both the cases and the controls were extensively phenotyped for anthropometric and biochemical traits related to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Arginine stimulation tests under fasting conditions were performed in a subgroup of 466 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four of the SNPs were associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, with rs2237892 showing strongest evidence for association (OR 1.532, 95% CI 1.381-1.698, p = 5.0 x 10(-16)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The SNP rs2237897 was associated with both <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> response after arginine stimulation in a subgroup of cases (p = 0.0471 and p = 0.0156, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The SNP rs2237895 was associated with both first- and second-phase insulin secretion in the controls (p = 0.0334 and p = 0.0002, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In this study we found that KCNQ1 was associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility in a Chinese population, possibly through its effect on beta cell function </plain></SENT>
