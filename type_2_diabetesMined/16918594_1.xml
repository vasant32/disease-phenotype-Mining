<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Leptin is an adipocyte-derived hormone involved in body weight regulation that acts through the leptin receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies exploring potential association between the leptin receptor (Lepr) variant and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> have reported conflicting results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objectives of the present study are to evaluate (1) whether the Lepr variant contributes to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and its related disorders such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and (2) whether the gene interaction between Lepr and Zn-alpha(2) glycoprotein1 (Azgp1) genes is recognized using genetically homogeneous type 2 diabetic KK/Ta mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The levels of leptin (Lep) and Lepr <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in adipose tissues and brain were measured by relative quantitative RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The levels of leptin protein in sera were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genotyping of backcross mice was performed using a mismatch primer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Leptin protein and its <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were increased in KK/Ta mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lepr <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of KK/Ta mice did not differ from those of BALB/c mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis revealed that the coding region of Lep in KK/Ta mice was identical to that in BALB/c mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Six nucleotide polymorphisms were observed in the coding region of Lepr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In KK/Ta x (BALB/c x KK/Ta) F1 backcross mice, the Lepr variant of KK/Ta mice failed to alter any of the variables of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> except for body weight at 20 weeks of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, it enhanced the effect of Azgp1 on body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It is concluded that the Lepr variant contributes to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> to some degree in KK/Ta mice </plain></SENT>
