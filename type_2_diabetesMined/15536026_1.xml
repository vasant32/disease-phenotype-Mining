<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Whether parity promotes the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> has been a subject of controversy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Earlier population studies have produced discrepant findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the current study was to investigate this question by examining the relationship between parity and the age of diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective analysis from a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> database was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data for 2102 women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2DM), including date of birth, age at diagnosis, parity, body mass index (BMI), and family history were extracted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A multivariate linear regression model was applied to ascertain if there was an association between parity and the age of diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: With correction for the year of birth, there was a significant association between parity and the age of diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (beta = -0.25 +/- 0.08, P = 0.002, where beta is the regression coefficient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>That is, for an increase in parity by one, the age of diagnosis decreased by 0.25 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When further adjustments were made for the other variables in the data set, the effect on the overall cohort disappeared, but it persisted in subjects born before 1950 (beta = -0.17 +/- 0.1, P = 0.09), or with a parity &gt;5 (beta = -0.60 +/- 0.25, P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is an association between parity and the age of diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, suggesting that pregnancy may promote the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the magnitude of the effect is small, and unlikely to be of great clinical significance in society today </plain></SENT>
