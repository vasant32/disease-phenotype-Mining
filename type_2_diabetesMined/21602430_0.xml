<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> metabolic response to submaximal exercise, the effect of exercise on plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> concentrations, and the interaction between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and exercise on the subsequent response to a standardized meal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Ten participants with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were recruited for this randomized crossover study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> or placebo was given for 28 days, followed by the alternate condition for 28 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the last 2 days of each condition, participants were assessed during a nonexercise and a subsequent exercise day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Exercise took place in the morning and involved a total of 35 min performed at three different submaximal intensities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> <z:mp ids='MP_0002626'>increased heart rate</z:mp> and plasma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> during exercise (both P≤0.01) but lowered respiratory exchange ratio (P=0.03) without affecting total energy expenditure, which suggests increased fat oxidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> plasma concentrations were greater at several, but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, time points on the exercise day compared with the nonexercise day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The glycemic response to a standardized meal was reduced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, but the reduction was attenuated when exercise was added (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>×exercise interaction, P=0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Glucagon levels were highest in the combined exercise and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals several ways by which <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and exercise therapies can affect each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>By increasing heart rate, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> could lead to the prescription of lower exercise workloads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, under the tested conditions, exercise interfered with the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
