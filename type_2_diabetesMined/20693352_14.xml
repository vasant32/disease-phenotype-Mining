<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin concentrations in individuals free of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that whole-grain food intake and genetic variation interact to influence concentrations of fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Via meta-analysis of data from 14 cohorts comprising ∼ 48,000 participants of European descent, we studied interactions of whole-grain intake with loci previously associated in GWAS with fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (16 loci) and/or insulin (2 loci) concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For tests of interaction, we considered a P value &lt;0.0028 (0.05 of 18 tests) as statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Greater whole-grain food intake was associated with lower fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin concentrations independent of demographics, other dietary and lifestyle factors, and BMI (β [95% CI] per 1-serving-greater whole-grain intake: -0.009 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> [-0.013 to -0.005], P &lt; 0.0001 and -0.011 pmol/l [ln] insulin [-0.015 to -0.007], P = 0.0003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No interactions met our multiple testing-adjusted statistical significance threshold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The strongest SNP interaction with whole-grain intake was rs780094 (GCKR) for fasting insulin (P = 0.006), where greater whole-grain intake was associated with a smaller reduction in fasting insulin concentrations in those with the insulin-raising allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the favorable association of whole-grain intake with fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin and suggest a potential interaction between variation in GCKR and whole-grain intake in influencing fasting insulin concentrations </plain></SENT>
