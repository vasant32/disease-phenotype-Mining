<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to assess the prevalence of unawareness of DSPN in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetes</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a sample of the older population of Augsburg, Germany.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSGlucose tolerance status was determined in 61- to 82-year-old participants of the population-based KORA F4 Study (2006-2008) (n = 1,100) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical DSPN was defined as the presence of bilaterally impaired foot-vibration perception and/or bilaterally impaired foot-pressure sensation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DSPN case subjects were considered unaware of their condition when answering "no" to the question, "Has a physician ever told you that you are suffering from nerve damage, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001271'>polyneuropathy</z:hpo>, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206172" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic foot</z:e>?"RESULTSClinical DSPN was prevalent in 154 (14%) participants, 140 of whom were unaware of their disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At a prevalence of 23.9% (95% CI 12.6-38.8), participants with combined impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> had the highest prevalence of DSPN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these, 10 of 11 (91%) were unaware of having clinical DSPN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Participants with known <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had an equally high prevalence of DSPN [22.0% (16.2-28.9)], with 30 of the 39 (77%) DSPN case subjects unaware of having the disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among subjects with known <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who reported to have had their feet examined by a physician, 18 of 25 (72%) clinical DSPN case subjects emerged unaware of having DSPN.CONCLUSIONSOur findings showed a high prevalence of unawareness of having clinical DSPN among the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetic</z:e> and diabetic groups and an insufficient frequency of professional foot examinations, suggesting inadequate attention to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206172" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic foot</z:e> prevention practice </plain></SENT>
