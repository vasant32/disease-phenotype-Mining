<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To learn if Hispanic people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have excess incidence and/or progression of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> and to explore the association of risk factors with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: There were 244 subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (65.3% Hispanic) with at least one follow-up visit between 1984 and 1992 examined for the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> over a median of 4.8 years (range 2.0-6.6 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Stereo fundus photos were graded by the University of Wisconsin Reading Center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 169 subjects without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> at baseline, 47 developed some <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, an incidence rate of 63.7 per 1,000 person-years (PY), or a 4-year cumulative incidence of 22.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Hispanic incidence rate was 58.3/1,000 PY (95% CI: 39.4-83.3), which was lower than among non-Hispanic whites, 76.1/1,000 PY (44.3-121.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Progression occurred in 24 of the 75 subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> at baseline, a 4-year cumulative rate of 24.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression showed that insulin treatment was associated with higher risk of any <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (odds ratio [OR] = 8.45, 2.65-26.97), and both systolic blood pressure (odds ratio [OR] = 1.58, 0.99-2.52) and total GHb (OR = 1.46, 0.99-2.17) nearly attained statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for multiple potential risk factors, the Hispanic/non-Hispanic white OR was 0.66 (0.28-1.57) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: No excess risk for incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> was found among Hispanic compared with non-Hispanic white subjects in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results are consistent with our previously reported prevalence data from the same population but differ from reports of excess prevalence among Texas Hispanics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No other Hispanic incidence data are available to assist in reconciling this difference </plain></SENT>
