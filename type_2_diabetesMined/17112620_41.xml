<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lately, it was suggested that <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and activation of the innate immune system could be linked to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> pathogenesis and also to the development of common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e>, mainly <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the role of monocytes in this sub-clinical inflammatory state and test 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3), the active form of <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">Vitamin D</z:chebi>, as an <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35472">anti-inflammatory agent</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, monocytes from type 2 diabetic patients were compared to monocytes from healthy controls and type 1 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression profile of inflammatory markers in freshly isolated and immune-stimulated monocytes was measured by quantitative real-time RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Type 2 diabetic patients showed significantly higher expression levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1, IL-8, COX-2, ICAM-1 and B7-1 compared to controls and type 1 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D(3) was able to down-regulate the expression of TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1, and IL-8, confirming its immunomodulatory properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>From these data we concluded that monocytes from type 2 diabetic patients have a pro-inflammatory profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) was able to modulate <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in these monocytes </plain></SENT>
