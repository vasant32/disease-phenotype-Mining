<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was an ancillary study to the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Habitual sleep duration and fragmentation were estimated from 6 days of wrist actigraphy collected in 2003-2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100785'>Insomnia</z:hpo> was defined as self-reported <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393760" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">difficulty falling asleep</z:e> or waking up in the night three or more times per week plus average sleep efficiency of &lt;80% based on actigraphy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fasting blood samples to measure <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin were collected after the sleep measures during the CARDIA clinical examination in 2005-2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo> was estimated using the homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analyses were cross-sectional and stratified by the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no association between sleep measures and fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, or HOMA in the 115 subjects without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the 40 subjects with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, after adjustment for covariates, 10% higher sleep fragmentation was associated with a 9% higher fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level, a 30% higher fasting insulin level, and a 43% higher HOMA level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100785'>Insomnia</z:hpo> was associated with a 23% higher fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level, a 48% higher fasting insulin level, and an 82% higher HOMA level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The observed association between poor sleep quality and higher <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, and estimated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> among subjects with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> warrants further examination of the effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002360'>sleep disturbances</z:hpo> on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
