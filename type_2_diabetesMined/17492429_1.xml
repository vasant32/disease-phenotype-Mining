<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to use a semi-quantitative assay for human plasma p75NTR to investigate whether this receptor is a marker of peripheral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011882" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic neuropathy</z:e> (DPN) and autonomic cardiovascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> (CAN) in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Eighty type 2 diabetic patients and 25 controls without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were analysed for p75NTR immunoreactivity by western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DPN was assessed using the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Neuropathy</z:e> Disability Score (NDS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular autonomic function was detected using a standardised analysis of heart rate variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three distinct p75NTR signals were detectable in human plasma at approximately 75, approximately 51 and approximately 24 kDa, representing the full length receptor (FL) and its intracellular domain (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) and extracellular domain (<z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp>), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Levels of total plasma p75NTR immunoreactivity in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were similar to those in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Type 2 diabetic patients had significantly higher plasma levels of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> and lower levels of <z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, there were no correlations of total p75NTR immunoreactivity or <z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> immunoreactivity with NDS or aspects of CAN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Levels of the <z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp> of p75NTR are reduced and levels of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> are increased in the plasma of type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>None of the p75NTR subunits identified in human plasma seem to be a marker of peripheral or autonomic neuronal function in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
