<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004943'>Accelerated atherosclerosis</z:hpo> is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitors</z:chebi> reduces oxidation of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-ox) in hypertensive subjects, however, their effect on <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-ox in diabetic patients is yet obscure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the effect of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitor</z:chebi> enalapril and the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="38215">calcium channel blocker</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">nifedipine</z:chebi> on <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> oxidation in normotensive type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A randomized single blinded cross-over study was conducted on 24 nonobese, metabolically stable, normotensive patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were randomly allocated to receive either enalapril, 10 mg/day, or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">nifedipine</z:chebi>, 30 mg/day, for 4 weeks followed by a 2-week washout period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They were then crossed over to a 4-week course with the alternate drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The oxidation of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> was evaluated by three methods: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38124">dialdehyde</z:chebi> analysis using the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33202">thiobarbituric acid</z:chebi> reactive substances assay with and without the addition of CuSO(4) as well as determination of conjugated dienes in the <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> extract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The propensity of the serum to oxidize <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> was reduced by enalapril by 17-28% depending on the laboratory method used (P=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">nifedipine</z:chebi> resulted in a rise in <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-ox of 7-11% as compared to baseline (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The difference between the effects of enalapril and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">nifedipine</z:chebi> was statistically significant with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three laboratory methods used (P=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both drugs were equally effective in reducing systolic and diastolic blood pressure without affecting HbA(1c) levels and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The albumin excretion rate was significantly reduced during treatment with enalapril returning to baseline levels during the washout period and the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">nifedipine</z:chebi> treatment course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that oxidation of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> is attenuated by ACE inhibition and augmented by some <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38215">calcium channel blockers</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This observation may contribute insight into the underlying mechanism of the therapeutic effects of ACE inhibition in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
