<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A prospective cohort of 4,438 patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e> (median observation period 2.9 years, interquartile range 1.6-4.1 years) was included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The end-point (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e>) was defined by: (1) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> due to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with renal manifestations or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo>; (2) hospitalisation due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo>; (3) estimated GFR (eGFR) &lt;15 ml min(-1) 1.73 m(-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards regression was used to develop risk equations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The data were randomly and evenly divided into the training data for development of the risk equations and the test data for validation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The validation was performed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (aROC), which takes into account follow-up time and censoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the observation period, 159 patients or 12.45 per 1,000 person-years (95% CI 10.52-14.37 per 1,000 person-years) developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Known duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, systolic blood pressure, log(10) total cholesterol:<z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> ratio and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> were significant predictors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After further adjusting for eGFR, log(10) spot albumin:<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio (ACR) and haematocrit, only eGFR, haematocrit and log(10) ACR remained as independent predictors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The risk equation derived from these three independent predictors had good discrimination, with an aROC of 0.97 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Estimated GFR, haematocrit and ACR were independent predictors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e> and the derived risk equation performed well in Chinese patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
