<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In an open-labelled 12-week, parallel study of 358 patients, aged 35-84 years with T2Dm, nateglinide was given as either monotherapy in patients previously on diet alone or low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi>, which required washout before the study (group 1), or as an addition therapy in patients on steady dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nateglinide 120 mg was given before main meals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HbA1c, FPG and <z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi> values were taken at the time of breakfast at the beginning and the end of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HbA1c fell by a mean of 0.83%, 95% confidence interval (CI) (-0.97, -0.69) (p &lt; 0.001) in group 1, and 0.67%, 95% CI (-0.77, -0.58) (p &lt; 0.001) in group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a significant improvement in <z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi> in group 1 by a mean reduction of -3.47 mmol/l, 95% CI (-4.08, -2.87) (p &lt; 0.0001) and in group 2 of -2.41 mmol/l, 95% CI (-2.84, -1.99) (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was an improvement in FPG of -1.2 mmol/l, 95% CI (-1.49, -0.81) (p &lt; 0.0001) and -0.8 mmol/l, 95% CI -(1.07, -0.53) (p &lt; 0.0001) in group 1 and 2 respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>44% of patients in group 1 and 34% in group 2 achieved target of HbA1c &lt; 7.0 and 66% in group 1 and 59% in group 2 achieved of HbA1c &lt; 7.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only one subject on nateglinide and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> was withdrawn due to the side effect of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No patient required third-party assistance nor was admitted to hospital due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that nateglinide is a safe and effective agent in treatment to target in patients with T2Dm up to an age of 84 years </plain></SENT>
