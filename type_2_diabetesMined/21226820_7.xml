<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">Sitagliptin</z:chebi> is a selective inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 that has been shown to reduce fasting and postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> presumably through incretin hormone-mediated improvements in islet function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of the present study is to examine the effects of treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> on postprandial <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> and incretin hormone levels as well as <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-six subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (30 men/6 postmenopausal women with a mean age of 58.1 ± 6.4 years and a body mass index of 30.7 ± 4.9 kg/m(2) ) were recruited in this double-blind cross-over study using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> 100 mg/day or placebo for a 6-week period each, with a 4-week washout period between the two phases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the end of each phase of treatment, patients underwent an oral <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> tolerance test providing 35 g of fat per m(2) of body surface area and blood samples were taken over an 8-h period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">Sitagliptin</z:chebi> therapy significantly decreased the postprandial area under the curves (AUCs) for plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> (apo)B (-5.1%, p = 0.002), apoB-48 (-7.8%, p = 0.03), TG (-9.4%, p = 0.006), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39027">very low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>)-cholesterol (-9.3%, p = 0.001), free fatty acids (FFAs) (-7.6%, p = 0.005) and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (-9.7%, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the postprandial AUCs for plasma intact glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (+67.8%, p &lt; 0.0001) and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent insulinotropic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (+67.3%, p &lt; 0.0001) were significantly increased following treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi>, whereas the AUC for plasma glucagon was reduced by -9.7% (p = 0.001) with no significant changes in the AUCs for plasma insulin and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">Sitagliptin</z:chebi> therapy also improved homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (-14.6%, p = 0.01) and β-cell function (+32.3%, p = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> for 6 weeks reduced postprandial plasma levels of TG-rich <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> of both intestinal and hepatic origin, most likely by increasing incretin hormone levels, reducing circulating plasma FFA concentrations and improving insulin sensitivity and β-cell function </plain></SENT>
