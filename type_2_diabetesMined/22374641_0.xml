<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: IGF-I has an almost 50% amino acid sequence homology with insulin and elicits nearly the same hypoglycemic response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies showed that low and high IGF-I levels are related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> and to a higher risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the current study was to evaluate the association between IGF-I level and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in a Danish general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Included were 3,354 adults, aged 19-72 years, from the cross-sectional Health2006 study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-IR) was used as the index to estimate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum IGF-I levels were determined by an immunoassay and grouped into quintiles (Q1-Q5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Linear or multinomial logistic regression analyses were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the study population, 520 subjects (15.5%) had increased HOMA-IR values above 2.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for age, sex, physical activity, and waist-to-height ratio, a U-shaped association between IGF-I and HOMA-IR was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Low IGF-I (Q1: odds ratio [OR] 1.65 [95% CI 1.16-2.34], P &lt; 0.01) as well as high IGF-I (Q5: 1.96 [1.38-2.79], P &lt; 0.01) levels were related to a higher odds of increased HOMA-IR values compared with subjects with intermediate (Q3) IGF-I levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These associations remained statistically significant after the exclusion of subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and by using the updated computer HOMA2-IR model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Low- and high-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> IGF-I levels are both related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The biological mechanism of this complex phenomenon has to be elucidated in more detail for future risk stratification </plain></SENT>
