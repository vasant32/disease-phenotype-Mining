<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim was to assess the relationship between adipokines, including interleukin (IL)-6, leptin, and adiponectin, with development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and assess the role of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in these relationships </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of 3,599 nondiabetic men aged 60-79 years and followed up for a mean period of 5 years, during which time there were 108 incident cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Elevated IL-6, leptin, and low adiponectin were associated with increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> even after adjustment for BMI, lifestyle factors, preexisting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, and systolic blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The relative risks (RRs) (top vs. bottom third) were 2.02 (95% CI 1.14-3.58) for IL-6, 1.91 (0.97-3.76) for leptin, and 0.40 (0.23-0.70) for adiponectin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further adjustment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> made minor differences to the IL-6 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> relationship (adjusted RR 2.12 [1.18-3.81]), weakened the associations with adiponectin (0.59 [0.33-1.04]), and abolished the association between leptin and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (1.12 [0.55-2.26]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The inverse relation between low adiponectin and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was significantly stronger in men who were <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (waist circumference &gt; 102 cm or BMI &gt; or = 30 kg/m2) (0.30 [0.11-0.79]) relative to leaner men (0.93 [0.44-1.96]) (test for interaction P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The association between leptin and incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is mediated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By contrast, the positive association between IL-6 and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> appeared to be independent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, the association between low adiponectin and increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> appears to be significantly stronger in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> men than in leaner counterparts </plain></SENT>
