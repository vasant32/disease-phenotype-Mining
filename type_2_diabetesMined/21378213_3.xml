<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 252 patients recruited from community health centers were randomized to the Latinos en Control intervention or to usual care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primarily group-based intervention consisted of 12 weekly and 8 monthly sessions and targeted knowledge, attitudes, and self-management behaviors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was HbA(1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Secondary outcomes included diet, physical activity, blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> self-monitoring, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> knowledge and self-efficacy, and other physiological factors (e.g., <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, blood pressure, and weight) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Measures were collected at baseline and at 4- and 12-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Change in outcomes over time between the groups and the association between HbA(1c) and possible mediators were estimated using mixed-effects models and an intention-to-treat approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significant difference in HbA(1c) change between the groups was observed at 4 months (intervention -0.88 [-1.15 to -0.60] versus control -0.35 [-0.62 to 0.07], P &lt; 0.01), although this difference decreased and lost statistical significance at 12 months (intervention -0.46 [-0.77 to -0.13] versus control -0.20 [-0.53 to 0.13], P = 0.293) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The intervention resulted in significant change differences in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> knowledge at 12 months (P = 0.001), self-efficacy (P = 0.001), blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> self-monitoring (P = 0.02), and diet, including dietary quality (P = 0.01), kilocalories consumed (P &lt; 0.001), percentage of fat (P = 0.003), and percentage of saturated fat (P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These changes were in turn significantly associated with HbA(1c) change at 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Literacy-sensitive, culturally tailored interventions can improve <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> control among low-income Latinos; however, strategies to sustain improvements are needed </plain></SENT>
