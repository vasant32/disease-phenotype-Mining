<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Recent publications have found an association between common variants near the hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4A) P2 promoter and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in some populations but not in others, and the role for HNF4A in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> has remained unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to address these inconsistencies, we investigated HNF4A single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a large population-based sample and included a meta-analysis of published studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We genotyped 12 SNPs in the HNF4A region in a Norwegian population-based sample of 1,644 individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 1,879 control subjects (the Nord-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Tr</z:e>Ã¸ndelag Health Study [HUNT] 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We combined our data with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> previously published case/control studies and performed a meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Consistent with initial studies, we found a trend toward association for the SNPs rs1884613 (odds ratio [OR] 1.17 [95% CI 1.03-1.35]) and rs2144908 (1.21 [1.05-1.38]) in the P2 region and for rs4812831 (1.21 [1.02-1.44]), located 34 kb downstream of the P2 promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Meta-analysis, comprising 12,292 type 2 diabetic case and 15,519 control subjects, revealed a nonsignificant OR of 1.05 (95% CI 0.98-1.12) but with significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> between the populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We therefore performed a subanalysis including only the data for subjects from Scandinavia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the 4,000 case and 7,571 control Scandinavian subjects, a pooled OR of 1.14 (1.06-1.23), P = 0.0004, was found for the SNP rs1884613 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that variation in the HNF4A region is associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Scandinavians, highlighting the importance of exploring small genetic effects in large, homogenous populations </plain></SENT>
