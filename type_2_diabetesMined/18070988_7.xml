<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We recorded detailed anthropometric data including height, weight, and health status and measured blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels and insulin concentrations after fasting and at 120 min of a standard oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test from 2,019 eligible subjects born between 1921 and 1954 to investigate the risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> regulation (IGR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and IGR groups were characterized by significantly lower birth weight (P &lt; 0.001), smaller head circumference (P &lt; 0.001), smaller ponderal index (P = 0.007), and shorter length (P = 0.004) compared with those in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using multiple logistic regression analysis, we observed that birth weight remained significantly associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and IGR after adjustments for possible confounding variables at birth and in adult life such as sex, age, central <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, smoking status, alcohol consumption, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e>, family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and occupational status (P = 0.027) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a significantly increased risk of getting <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and IGR for those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birth weight</z:hpo> (odds ratio 1.748 [95% CI 1.018-3.001], P = 0.043) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm that lower birth weight is an independent risk factor for later <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or IGR and show for the first time that this risk factor also applies for a Chinese population </plain></SENT>
