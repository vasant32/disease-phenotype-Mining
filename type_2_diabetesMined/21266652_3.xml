<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: MRN comprised high-resolution transaxial imaging of peripheral nerves of the lower limbs in 20 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (10 with dPNP, type 2/dPNP[+], and 10 without dPNP, type 2/dPNP[-]), seven patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (two with dPNP, type 1/dPNP[+], five without dPNP, type 1/dPNP[-]), and 10 nondiabetic control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intraneural T2 lesions, as the main diagnostic criterion of MRN, were detected visually by two independent observers and quantitatively by analysis of T2 contrast ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Multifocal fascicular, symmetric intraneural T2 lesions occurred in the proximal trunks of sciatic nerves in four patients (three with type 2/dPNP[+] and one with type 1/dPNP[+]) but not in control subjects (type 2/dPNP[-], type 1/dPNP[-], nondiabetic control subjects), which was confirmed by quantitative analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical severity was higher in patients with T2 lesions (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> deficit score: 10 vs. 7.8; P = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, proximal neuropathic lesions of dPNP are reported in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This supports that accumulation of proximal, multifocal fascicular injury may be important in disease progression </plain></SENT>
