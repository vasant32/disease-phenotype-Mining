<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: With the introduction of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> disease management programs (DMPs) in Germany, there is a necessity to evaluate whether patients receive care that is congruent to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> Care Model (CCM) and evidence-based behavioral counseling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined differences as perceived and experienced by patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> between those enrolled in a DMP compared with patients receiving usual care in two federal states of Germany </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A random, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> sample of 3,546 patients (59.3% female) received a mailed questionnaire from their regional health fund, including the German version of the Patient Assessment of Chonic Illness Care (PACIC) instrument, which had additional items for behavioral advice (5A) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two weeks later, a general reminder was sent out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 1,532 questionnaires were returned (response rate 42.2%), and valid data could be obtained for 1,399 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean age of responders was 70.3 years, of which 53.6% were female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, patients enrolled in a DMP scored significantly higher (3.21 of a possible 5) than patients not enrolled in a DMP (2.86) (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant differences in the same direction were found on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five subscales of the PACIC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For the 5A scales, similar differences were found for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five subscales plus the sum score (P &lt; 0.001; mean for DMP = 3.08, mean for non-DMP = 2.78) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: DMPs, as currently established in primary care in Germany, may impact provided care significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The changes in daily practice that have been induced by the DMPs are recognized by patients as care that is more structured and that to a larger extent reflects the core elements of the CCM and evidence-based counseling compared with usual care </plain></SENT>
