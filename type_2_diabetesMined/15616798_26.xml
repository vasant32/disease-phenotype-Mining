<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study was based on 4,069 men and 4,034 women (aged 25 to 74 years) who participated in one of the three MONICA Augsburg surveys between 1984 and 1995 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects were free of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Incident cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were assessed in 1998 using a follow-up questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sex-specific hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated from Cox proportional hazard models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 145 cases of incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among men and 82 among women were registered during the mean follow-up period of 7.4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In both sexes, a high leisure time physical activity level was associated with a reduced risk of incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for confounding factors, the HR in highly active men (more than 2 h physical activity per week in summer and winter) was 0.83 (95% CI: 0.50-1.36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, highly active women had the lowest risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> even after multivariable adjustment (HR 0.24; 95% CI: 0.06-0.98) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In subgroup analyses, after multivariable adjustment, the protective effect of moderate to high physical activity was significant in women with a BMI below 30 kg/m(2) (HR 0.24; 95% CI: 0.09-0.65) but not in women with a BMI of 30 kg/m(2) or higher (HR 0.97; 95% CI: 0.44-2.11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Leisure time physical activity is effective in preventing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, especially in nonobese women, in the general population </plain></SENT>
