<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its receptors, adipoR1 and R2, have recently been identified, but their expression in adipose tissue and their regulation in response to insulin sensitisation of diabetic patients have never been assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore explored the regulation of adipoR1/R2 and adiponectin expression in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle, and of adiponectin plasma concentrations in response to insulin sensitisation by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were studied in a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study, using in vivo arteriovenous techniques of measuring adipose tissue and muscle blood flow, combined with measurement of adipose tissue and skeletal muscle gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">Rosiglitazone</z:chebi> treatment increased adiponectin concentrations by 69% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Skeletal muscle adipoR1 expression was down-regulated from 109.0 (70.1-165.7) (median [interquartile range]) to 82.8 (63.6-89.3) relative units (p=0.04), but adipose tissue adipoR1 expression was up-regulated from 5.3 (4.4-9.4) to 11.2 (4.8-15.3) relative units (p=0.02) by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast to adipoR1 expression, adipoR2 expression was not altered by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> in either of the tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The increase in adipose tissue adipoR1 expression with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> was associated with increased postprandial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> clearance (r=0.67, p=0.05), and increased fasting fatty acid output (r=0.78, p=0.01) measured in subcutaneous adipose tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: AdipoR1 expression is up-regulated in adipose tissue but down-regulated in skeletal muscle by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that adipoR1 plays a role in mediating the effects of adiponectin in specific tissues in relation to insulin sensitisation </plain></SENT>
