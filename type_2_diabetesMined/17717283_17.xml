<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Among other metabolic consequences, a dyslipidemic profile often accompanies childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In adults, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>hepatic steatosis</z:hpo> have been shown to alter <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> subclass distribution and size; however, these alterations have not yet been shown in children or adolescents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, our objective was to determine the effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>hepatic steatosis</z:hpo> on <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> concentration and size in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> adolescents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using fast magnetic resonance imaging, we measured intrahepatic fat content in 49 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> adolescents with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence or absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>hepatic steatosis</z:hpo> was determined by a threshold value for hepatic fat fraction (HFF) of 5.5%; therefore, the cohort was divided into two groups (HFF &gt; or &lt;5.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fasting <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> subclasses were determined using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, the high-HFF group had 88% higher concentrations of large <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi> compared with the low-HFF group (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Likewise, the high-HFF group had significantly higher concentrations of small dense <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.007); however, the low-HFF group had significantly higher concentrations of large <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed that high HFF was the strongest single correlate, accounting for 32.6% of the variance in large <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi> concentrations (P &lt; 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>fatty liver</z:hpo> was associated with a pronounced dyslipidemic profile characterized by large <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>, small dense <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>, and decreased large <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This proatherogenic phenotype was strongly related to the intrahepatic <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> content </plain></SENT>
