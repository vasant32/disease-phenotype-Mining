<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>UCP3 plays a role in fatty acid metabolism and energy homeostasis and modulates insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In humans, UCP3 content is higher in fast-twitch glycolytic muscle than in slow-twitch oxidative muscle and is dysregulated in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we studied the molecular mechanisms determining human UCP3 levels in skeletal muscle and their regulation by fasting in transgenic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We produced a series of transgenic lines with constructs bearing different putative regulatory regions of the human UCP3 gene, including promoter and intron sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>UCP3 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and reporter gene expression and activity were measured in different skeletal muscles and tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The profile of expression and the response to fasting and thyroid hormone of human UCP3 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in transgenic mice with 16 kb of the human UCP3 gene were similar to that of the endogenous human gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Various parts of the UCP3 promoter did not confer expression in transgenic lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Inclusion of intron 1 resulted in an expression profile in skeletal muscle that was identical to that of human UCP3 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further dissection of intron 1 revealed that distinct regions were involved in skeletal muscle expression, distribution among fibre types and response to fasting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The control of human UCP3 transcription in skeletal muscle is not solely conferred by the promoter, but depends on several cis-acting elements in intron 1, suggesting a complex interplay between the promoter and intronic sequences </plain></SENT>
