<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Conversely, in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, insulin secretion is impaired as a consequence of decreased insulin pulse mass </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that decreased beta-cell mass leads to decreased insulin pulse mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Insulin secretion was examined before and after an approximately 60% decrease in beta-cell mass achieved by a single injection of alloxan in a porcine model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Alloxan injection resulted in stable <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> 7.4 +/- 1.1 vs. 4.4 +/- 0.1 mmol/l; P &lt; 0.01) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948379" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">impaired insulin secretion</z:e> in the fasting and fed states and during a hyperglycemic clamp (decreased by 54, 80, and 90%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Deconvolution analysis revealed a selective decrease in insulin pulse mass (by 54, 60, and 90%) with no change in pulse frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Rhythm analysis revealed no change in the periodicity of regular oscillations after alloxan administration in the fasting state but was unable to detect stable rhythms reliably after enteric or intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After alloxan administration, insulin secretion and insulin pulse mass (but not insulin pulse interval) decreased in relation to beta-cell mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the decreased pulse mass (and pulse amplitude delivered to the liver) was associated with a decrease in hepatic insulin clearance, which partially offset the <z:mp ids='MP_0003059'>decreased insulin secretion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Despite <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, postprandial glucagon concentrations were increased after alloxan administration (103.4 +/- 6.3 vs. 92.2 +/- 2.5 pg/ml; P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We conclude that an alloxan-induced selective decrease in beta-cell mass leads to deficient insulin secretion by attenuating insulin pulse mass, and that the latter is associated with decreased hepatic insulin clearance and relative hyperglucagonemia, thereby emulating the pattern of islet dysfunction observed in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
