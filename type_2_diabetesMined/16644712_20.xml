<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Conversion to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 169) was associated with higher BMI, blood pressure, cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> and C-reactive protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The hazard ratio (HR) for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> of a BMI &gt;30 kg/m(2) was 3.96 (95% CI 2.87-5.47) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Homozygosity for the UCP2A or UCP3T alleles accelerated the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, with significant differences in risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at 10 years (HR [95% CI] UCP2AA vs. GA+GG 1.94 [1.18-3.19], P = 0.009; UCP3TT vs. CC+ CT 2.06 [1.06-3.99], P = 0.03) but less so at 15 years (UCP2AA 1.42 [0.92-2.19], P = 0.1; UCP3TT 1.57 [0.87-2.04], P = 0.13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Men who were homozygous for both UCP2AA and UCP3TT (1.5% of men) had a risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at 10 years of 4.20 (1.70-10.37), P = 0.002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These genotype effects were additive with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and men with a BMI &gt;30 kg/m(2) and this genotype combination had a 10-year risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> of 19.23 [5.63-63.69], P &lt; 0.0001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Functional promoter variants UCP2 and UCP3 increase the prospective risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although the mechanism of the UCP2 effect is likely to be caused by increased expression in the pancreas and subsequent <z:mp ids='MP_0003059'>reduced insulin secretion</z:mp>, the mechanism of the UCP3 effect is currently unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both effects are exacerbated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
