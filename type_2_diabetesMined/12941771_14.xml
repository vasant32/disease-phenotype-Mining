<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known about the prevention of amylin aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the role of insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) in amylin degradation, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_34'>amyloid deposition</z:mpath>, and cytotoxicity in RIN-m5F <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021670" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">insulinoma</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Human (125)I-labeled amylin degradation was inhibited by 46 and 65% with the addition of 100 nmol/l human amylin or insulin, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(125)I-labeled insulin degradation was inhibited with 100 nmol/l human amylin, rat amylin, and insulin (by 50, 50, and 73%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The IDE inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28669">bacitracin</z:chebi> inhibited amylin degradation by 78% and insulin degradation by 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Amyloid staining by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34653">Congo red</z:chebi> fluorescence was detectable at 100 nmol/l amylin and was pronounced at 1,000 nmol/l amylin treatment for 48 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="28669">Bacitracin</z:chebi> treatment markedly increased staining at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> amylin concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="28669">Bacitracin</z:chebi> with amylin caused a dramatic decrease in cell viability compared with amylin alone (68 and 25%, respectively, at 10 nmol/l amylin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In summary, RIN-m5F cells degraded both amylin and insulin through a common proteolytic pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>IDE inhibition by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28669">bacitracin</z:chebi> impaired amylin degradation, increased amyloid formation, and increased amylin-induced cytotoxicity, suggesting a role for IDE in amylin clearance and the prevention of amylin aggregation </plain></SENT>
