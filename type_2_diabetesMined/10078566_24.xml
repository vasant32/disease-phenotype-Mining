<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its biallelic gene polymorphism at codon 192 (glutamine/arginine) has been associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To further evaluate the role of this paraoxonase gene polymorphism for CAD in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we determined the paraoxonase genotype in 288 type 2 diabetic patients (170 with and 118 without angiographically documented CAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The paraoxonase 192 Gln/Arg genotype was assessed using polymerase chain reaction followed by AlwI digestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the Gln allele was 0.656 in the CAD patients and 0.746 in the controls (chi2 = 5.36, P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with the Gln/Gln genotypes, the age-adjusted odds ratio for CAD was 1.78 (95% CI 1.08-2.96, P = 0.02) in subjects carrying at least one Arg allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate analysis, this association was even stronger after correction for the possible confounders age, sex, smoking history, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among current and former smokers, the odds ratio (OR) for having CAD among patients with at least one Arg allele was 3.58 (1.45-9.53, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The paraoxonase Arg allele was not associated with the history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (OR 1.20 [0.73-1.99, NS]), but was with the extent of CAD (OR for three-vessel disease 1.92 [1.15-3.27, P = 0.01]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that the 192 Arg allele of the human paraoxonase gene is a risk factor for CAD but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> in type 2 diabetic patients, a risk factor further modified by cigarette smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This risk could possibly be explained by a reduced ability of the paraoxonase Arg isoform to protect <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> against peroxidation </plain></SENT>
