<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the association of regular exercise, BMI, and fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> with the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and to predict the risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Korean subjects (n = 7,233; 40-79 years old) who were not diagnosed with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at baseline were enrolled through the National Health Insurance Corporation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants underwent biennial examinations, and 1,947 of 7,233 subjects also underwent a 6-month program of moderate-intensity exercise (300 min/week) without dietary advice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During follow-up (mean = 2 years), there were 303 incidents of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the nonexercise program group (n = 5,286) and 83 in the exercise program group (n = 1,947) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for confounders, the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was positively associated with BMI and inversely with regular exercise, especially among overweight/<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After further adjustment for BMI, the odds ratios for risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> associated without and with regular exercise were 1.00 and 0.77, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, exercise reduced the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk; however, among those with impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (IFG), the protective effect of exercise was found only among overweight/<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overweight/<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects in the exercise program group exhibited improved fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> compared with the nonexercise program group and showed 1.5 kg of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and a 3-cm decrease in waist circumference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among overweight/<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects with unchanged fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> was greater in the exercise program group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Regular exercise reduces the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in overweight/<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Particularly, regular exercise and weight or waist circumference control are critical factors for preventing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in overweight/<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals with IFG </plain></SENT>
