<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Despite good evidence and clinical practice guidelines, studies document that treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is less than optimal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lack of resources or limited access may put patients in rural communities at particular risk for suboptimal care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective, before/after study with concurrent controls to assess the effectiveness of a multidisciplinary <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> outreach service (intervention) for improving the quality of care for rural patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our intervention consisted of six monthly visits by a traveling team of specialist physicians, nurses, dieticians, and a pharmacist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The core of this service was specialist-to-rural primary care physician academic group detailing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two comparable regions in Northern Alberta were randomly allocated to control or intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data were collected before and 6 months after intervention in a representative volunteer sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was a 10% improvement in any one of the following: blood pressure, total cholesterol, or HbA(1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our analysis included 200 intervention and 179 control subjects; 14 subjects were at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three primary outcome targets at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The intervention was associated with a trend toward improvement in primary outcome at 6 months (44% intervention vs. 37% control; odds ratio 1.32, 95% CI 0.87-1.99) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The intervention was associated with a significant improvement in blood pressure (42% intervention vs. 25% control, P = 0.004); however, there were only small, nonsignificant changes in cholesterol or HbA(1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The intervention was associated with a significant increase in satisfaction with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Multivariate adjustment for baseline differences between intervention and control subjects did not affect any of the main results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> outreach service has the potential to improve the quality of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care for rural patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Future studies need to involve longer timelines and larger sample sizes </plain></SENT>
