<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, the NeuroD/BETA2 gene has been mapped to the long arm of human chromosome 2 (2q32) where the IDDM7 gene has previously been mapped, implying its involvement in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To identify mutations in the NeuroD/BETA2 gene that may predispose patients to develop <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we studied the gene in 50 Japanese subjects with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (4 with type 1 and 46 with type 2) by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by single-strand conformation polymorphism and sequencing analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Further analysis was performed in 392 Japanese subjects (60 with type 1 and 158 with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 174 healthy control subjects) by mismatch PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found a DNA polymorphism of the NeuroD/BETA2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A nucleotide G-to-A transition results in the substitution of alanine to threonine at codon 45 (Ala45Thr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of heterozygotes for the Ala45Thr variant were 9.8% in the control subjects, 9.5% in the patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and 25.0% in the patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, a significant difference (P = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because the variant of the NeuroD/BETA2 gene (Ala45Thr) is associated with type 1 but not type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, it may be implicated in the loss of pancreatic beta-cells in type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
