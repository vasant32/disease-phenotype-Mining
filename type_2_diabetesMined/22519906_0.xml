<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their long-term safety is still a subject of debate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A systematic review of randomized, controlled trials was undertaken to comprehensively profile the safety of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> treatment of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> with DPP-4 inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We searched data sources including MEDLINE, CENTRAL, publishers' and manufacturers' databases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eligible trials were double-blind, randomized, placebo or active-controlled trials with â‰¥18 weeks duration in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> reporting safety outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Meta-analysis was performed separately for trials in which the control group received placebo (44 studies), another gliptin (3 studies) and any other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drug (20 studies) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals were computed using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model for general safety outcomes, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> and adverse events by system organ class </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of 307 publications retrieved, 67 randomized, controlled trials met the eligibility criteria and were included in this review (4 alogliptin, 8 linagliptin, 8 saxagliptin, 20 sitagliptin, and 27 vildagliptin trials) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adverse events with gliptin treatment were at placebo level (relative risk (RR) 1.02 [0.99, 1.04]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> was detectable (RR 0.98 [0.93, 1.05] compared to placebo and 1.02 [0.97, 1.07] compared to other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Asthenia (RR 1.57 [1.09, 2.27]) as well as cardiac (RR 1.37 [1.00, 1.89]) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disorders</z:e> (RR 1.74 [1.05, 2.86] for linagliptin) emerged as adverse events associated with DPP-4 inhibitor treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> was low with DPP-4 inhibitor treatment (RR 0.92 [0.74, 1.15] compared to placebo, RR 0.20 [0.17, 0.24] compared to sulphonylureas) in the absence of sulphonylurea or insulin co-therapy, but significantly elevated for combination therapy of sulphonylurea or insulin with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> or linagliptin (RR 1.86 [1.46, 2.37] compared to placebo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A large body of data supports the long-term safety of gliptin treatment and refutes an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further research is needed to clarify a possible link to asthenia, cardiac and vascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>For combination therapy with insulin or insulin secretagogues, a careful choice of the agent used may limit the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
