<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate whether a low-fat vegan diet improves glycemic control and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> in individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 99) were randomly assigned to a low-fat vegan diet (n = 49) or a diet following the American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association (<z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi>) guidelines (n = 50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants were evaluated at baseline and 22 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-three percent (21 of 49) of the vegan group and 26% (13 of 50) of the <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> group participants reduced <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants, HbA(1c) (A1C) decreased 0.96 percentage points in the vegan group and 0.56 points in the <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> group (P = 0.089) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Excluding those who changed medications, A1C fell 1.23 points in the vegan group compared with 0.38 points in the <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> group (P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Body weight decreased 6.5 kg in the vegan group and 3.1 kg in the <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> group (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Body weight change correlated with A1C change (r = 0.51, n = 57, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among those who did not change <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering medications, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> fell 21.2% in the vegan group and 10.7% in the <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> group (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for baseline values, urinary albumin reductions were greater in the vegan group (15.9 mg/24 h) than in the <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> group (10.9 mg/24 h) (P = 0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Both a low-fat vegan diet and a diet based on <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> guidelines improved glycemic and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> control in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These improvements were greater with a low-fat vegan diet </plain></SENT>
