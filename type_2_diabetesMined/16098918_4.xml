<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to examine the effects of a high-fat diet (HFD: carbohydrates 35-40% kcal, fat 50-55% kcal, protein 10-15% kcal) and a high-<z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> diet (HSD: carbohydrates 65-70% kcal, fat 25-30% kcal, protein 10-15% kcal) compared to a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or standard diet (ND: carbohydrates 50-55% kcal, fat 15-20% kcal, protein 25-30% kcal) on fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test, plasma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, plasma cholesterol, body weight, food and water consumption in male Wistar rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After 4 months, <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>, plasma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> level, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and water intake were significantly elevated (p&lt;0.05) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> test groups when compared to the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Total <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> levels were significantly elevated (p&lt;0.05) in the HFD group, whereas the <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> level was significantly lower in the HSD group associated with an atherogenic index significantly elevated (p&lt;0.05) when compared to the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 16 weeks of dietary treatment, an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) showed a significant increase in plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels after 2-4 h of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> challenge in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> test groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the experiment, it was noticed that important <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> dietary test groups was associated with a significant low (p&lt;0.05) food consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The above results suggest that dietary nutrients contained in these hypercaloric diets might have an effect on insulin action and therefore, might contribute to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results also suggest that, in addition to their diabetogenic effect, these hypercaloric diets might probably have an atherogenic effect and could be use in a long-term study to induce type 2 (non-insulino-dependant) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
