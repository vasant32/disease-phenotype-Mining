<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested a hyperspectral imaging technology that quantifies cutaneous tissue <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> oxygenation and generated anatomically relevant tissue oxygenation maps to assess the healing potential of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206172" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic foot</z:e> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> (DFUs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A prospective single-arm blinded study was completed in which 66 patients with type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were enrolled and followed over a 24-week period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical, medical, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> histories were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transcutaneous oxygen tension was measured at the ankles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Superficial tissue <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> (oxy) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5656">deoxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> (deoxy) were measured with hyperspectral imaging from intact tissue bordering the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A healing index derived from oxy and deoxy values was used to assess the potential for healing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-four patients with 73 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> completed the study; at 24 weeks, 54 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> healed while 19 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> did not heal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When using the healing index to predict healing, the sensitivity was 80% (43 of 54), the specificity was 74% (14 of 19), and the positive predictive value was 90% (43 of 48) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive values increased to 86, 88, and 96%, respectively, when removing three false-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002754'>osteomyelitis</z:hpo> cases and four false-negative cases due to measurements on a callus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that cutaneous tissue oxygenation correlates with wound healing in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Hyperspectral imaging of tissue oxy and deoxy may predict the healing of DFUs with high sensitivity and specificity based on information obtained from a single visit </plain></SENT>
