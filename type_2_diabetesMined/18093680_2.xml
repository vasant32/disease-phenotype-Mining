<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: While CKD is a common finding in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the clinical response to its identification is often problematic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aims to determine the frequency of <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the primary care setting and examine the factors which influence its management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Expressions of interest were invited from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> registered GPs across Australia, from whom 500 investigators were randomly selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Investigators were requested to document the clinical characteristics of 10-15 consecutively presenting patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results from the most recent urinalysis were classified according to guidelines, then systematically compared to classifications provided by GPs themselves and their management strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One in three patients had an elevated urinary albumin excretion (UAE, 34.6%, 95% CI, 33.3-35.9%) on their most recent urinalysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo>, as identified by the GP, was not associated with a perceived increase in cardiovascular risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the use of aspirin and the prescribing of agents to block the <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> were not significantly linked to UAE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the perceived adequacy of blood pressure control was not significantly different whether or not <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> was identified to be present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: An elevated UAE is a common finding in general practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, it fails to significantly influence their clinical care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Additional education to ensure appropriate case recognition and management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> is needed, focusing on the significance of <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> to the care of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
