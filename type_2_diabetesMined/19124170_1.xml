<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these, 14,560 (93.0%) and 1092 (7.0%) patients were cared for by general practitioners and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> specialists, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HbA1c levels were measured by a latex agglutination method, and age, height, body weight, type of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and treatment modality were obtained from each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean HbA1c level for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients treated by general practitioners was significantly lower than for those treated by the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> specialists (6.8+/-1.2% vs. 7.0+/-1.2%, p=0.0002) </plain></SENT>
