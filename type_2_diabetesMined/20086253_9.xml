<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The sample consisted of 6,111 individuals free from self-reported doctor-diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at baseline in 2002-2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The eight-item Center for Epidemiological Studies-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e>-D) scale was the measurement of depressive symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to assess whether baseline elevated (&gt; or =4) depressive symptoms were associated with a higher risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> over 45.8 months of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The hazard ratio (HR) for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 1.62 (95% CI 1.15-2.29) in a model adjusted for age, sex, marital status, education, total net household wealth, cardiovascular and psychiatric and other noncardiovascular comorbidities, BMI, and health behaviors for participants with elevated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e>-D symptoms compared with those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Complementary analysis performed for a subsample (n = 5,090) showed that additional adjustment of this model for use of antidepressants did not explain the association (HR 1.58, 95% CI 1.09-2.29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Elevated depressive symptoms were associated with a higher risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after accounting for sociodemographic, lifestyle, and clinical factors in a national sample of people aged &gt; or =50 years </plain></SENT>
