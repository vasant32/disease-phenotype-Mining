<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our recent in vivo observations in healthy nonobese humans have demonstrated that prolonged elevation of plasma free fatty acids (FFAs) results in diminished <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) when the FFA-mediated decrease in insulin sensitivity is taken into account </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated whether <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals and patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are more sensitive than healthy control subjects to the inhibitory effect of prolonged elevation of plasma FFAs on GSIS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In seven patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and seven healthy nondiabetic <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals, we assessed GSIS with a programmed graded intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion on two occasions, 6-8 weeks apart, with and without a prior 48-h infusion of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and Intralipid, which was designed to raise plasma FFA concentration approximately twofold over basal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The nondiabetic <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects had a significant 21% decrease in GSIS (P = 0.0008) with the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and Intralipid infusion, associated with a decrease in whole body insulin clearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The impairment in GSIS was evident at low (&lt;11 mmol/l) but not at higher plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had a slight increase in GSIS (P = 0.027) and no change in insulin clearance, although there was marked interindividual variability in response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma proinsulin concentrations measured in a subset of subjects were not altered in either group by the infusion of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and Intralipid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In summary, 1) <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> nondiabetic individuals are susceptible to a desensitization of GSIS with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and Intralipid infusion, and 2) patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> do not demonstrate such susceptibility when FFAs are elevated approximately twofold above basal with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and Intralipid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that FFAs could play an important role in the development of beta-cell failure in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals who are at risk for developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>They do not, however, seem to further deteriorate the beta-cell function of patients who already have established type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and may even result in a slight increase in GSIS in this latter group </plain></SENT>
