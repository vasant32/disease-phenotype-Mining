<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Posttransplantation <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (PTDM) is a major complication associated with kidney transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Defects in insulin secretion play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of PTDM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A polymorphism in the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene was reported to be associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and possibly associated with an insulin secretion defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the association between genetic variations in TCF7L2 and PTDM in renal allograft recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 511 unrelated renal allograft recipients without previously known <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs11196205, rs4506565, rs12243326, rs7903146, rs12255372, and rs7901695) were genotyped in the cohort, which consisted of 119 PTDM patients and 392 non-PTDM subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The genotyping of TCF7L2 polymorphisms was performed using real-time PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: rs4506565, rs7901695, and rs7903146 were found to be in complete linkage disequilibrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The rs7903146 genotype distribution was CC 94.3% and CT 5.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence of PTDM was significantly higher in patients with the CT genotype than in patients with the CC genotype (41.4 vs. 22.2%) (odds ratio 2.474 [95% CI 1.146-5.341]; P = 0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The effect of this genotype remains significant after adjustment for age, sex, amount of body <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>, and type of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressant</z:chebi> (2.655 [1.168-6.038]; P = 0.020) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the TCF7L2 rs7903146 genetic variation is associated with an increased risk of PTDM in renal allograft recipients </plain></SENT>
