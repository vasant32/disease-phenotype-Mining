<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">Glycogen</z:chebi> synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) has been implicated in the pathophysiology of several prevalent diseases, including <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, despite recent progress in our understanding of the role of GSK3 in the regulation of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in peripheral tissues, the involvement of GSK3 in islet beta cell growth and function in vivo is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore sought to determine whether over-activation of GSK3beta would lead to alterations in islet beta cell mass and/or function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Transgenic mice overexpressing a constitutively active form of human GSK3beta (S9A) under the control of the rat insulin promoter (RIP-GSK3betaCA) were created </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Studies using <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1522248" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">mouse insulinoma</z:e> cells (MIN6) were conducted to investigate the regulation of GSK3beta activity and its impact on pancreas/duodenum homeobox protein-1 (PDX-1) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We demonstrated that phosphorylation of GSK3beta was decreased, indicating increased GSK3beta activity in two animal models of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, Lepr(-/- ) mice and Ins2 (Akita/+) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In MIN6 cells, the activity of GSK3beta was regulated by <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, in a fashion largely dependent on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RIP-GSK3betaCA transgenic mice showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> after 5 months of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Histological studies revealed that transgenic mice had decreased beta cell mass and decreased beta cell proliferation, with a 50% decrease (p&lt;0.05) in the level of PDX-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We showed direct evidence that GSK3beta activity is associated with beta cell failure in diabetic mouse models and that its overactivation resulted in decreased pancreatic beta cell proliferation and mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>GSK3 modulates PDX-1 stability in both cultured <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021670" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">insulinoma</z:e> cells and islets in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results may ultimately facilitate the development of potential therapeutic interventions targeting type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and/or islet transplantation </plain></SENT>
