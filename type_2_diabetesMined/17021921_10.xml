<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate whether PEA15 overexpression occurs in individuals at high risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and whether it is associated with specific type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> subphenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We analysed PEA15 expression in euglycaemic first-degree relatives (FDR) of type 2 diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The expression of PEA15 in peripheral blood leucocytes (PBLs) paralleled that in fat and skeletal muscle tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In PBLs from the FDR, PEA15 expression was two-fold higher than in euglycaemic individuals with no family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (control subjects), both at the protein and the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of PEA15 was comparable in FDR and type 2 diabetic subjects and in each group close to one-third of the subjects expressed PEA15 levels more than 2 SD higher than the mean of control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subjects with IFG with at least one type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-affected FDR also overexpressed PEA15 (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the groups analysed, PEA15 expression was independent of sex and unrelated to age, BMI, waist circumference, systolic and diastolic BP, and fasting cholesterol, triacylglycerol and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, in euglycaemic FDR of type 2 diabetic subjects, PEA15 expression was inversely correlated with insulin sensitivity (r = -557, p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We conclude that PEA15 overexpression represents a common defect in FDR of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and is correlated with reduced insulin sensitivity in these individuals </plain></SENT>
