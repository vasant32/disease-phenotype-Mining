<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to clarify the relationship between <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> particle size and postprandial remnant <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> levels in Japanese type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-six patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> were divided into tertiles according to <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> particle size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The peak <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> particle diameter was &lt;26.30 nm in tertile 1, 26.30-26.85 nm in tertile 2, and &gt;26.85 nm in tertile 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After a test meal, tertile 1 had a significantly greater increment of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (TG), remnant-like particle (RLP)-TG, and RLP-cholesterol (RLP-C) than tertiles 2 and 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a negative correlation between <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> particle size and the postprandial increases of TG, RLP-TG, and RLP-C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that smaller sized <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> particles may be a marker of fasting state for an exaggerated postprandial increase of remnant <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> as well as an increase of TG-rich <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
