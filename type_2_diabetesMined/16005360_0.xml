<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since we have found that insulin specifically inhibits glucagon-induced glycogenolysis in perivenous hepatocytes (PVH) from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rats, we examined the inhibitory effect of insulin on glucagon-induced glycogenolysis in PVH of hyperinsulinemic WF rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Basal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> release was 64.0+/-4.1 nmol/mgprotein/30 min from PVH of lean littermates (WL rats) and 137.0+/-19.3 nmol/mgprotein/30 min from that of WF rats (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These were proportional to the <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> content in PVH of WL and WF rats (56.7+/-7.2 and 131.0+/-20.3 microg/mgprotein, p&lt;0.01), and increased to 109.0+/-8.8 and 225.8+/-17.9nmol/mgprotein/30min, respectively, with 0.1 nmol/l glucagon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When 10 nmol/l insulin was coincubated, 0.1 nmol/l glucagon-induced increase in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> release decreased to 93.3+/-10.9 nmol/mgprotein/30 min in PVH of WL rats (p&lt;0.01) and to 181+/-20.7 nmol/mgprotein/30 min in PVH of WF rats (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, insulin antagonized glucagon-induced glycogenolysis in PVH similarly between WL and WF rats, to 56.7+/-13.3% and to 46.1+/-7.5%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, the antagonizing effect of insulin on glucagon-induced increase in glycogenolysis was preserved in PVH of hyperinsulinemic and hyperglycemic WF rats </plain></SENT>
