<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied the incorporation of dietary n - 3 fatty acids from marine oils into red cell membranes, using animal models of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi>-treated Wistar rats) and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (gold-thioglucose-injected CBA/T6 mice) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In type 1 diabetic rats, eicosapentaenoic acid (<z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36005">docosahexaenoic acid</z:chebi> (DHA) were higher following marine oil supplementation, and the increase in <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> was significantly greater than in non-diabetic animals (3.4 +/- 1.4% vs. 0.8 +/- 1.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Marine oil supplementation also resulted in higher levels of <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> and DHA in mice, but the increases were quantitatively similar with and without type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Improvement in glycosylated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> following n - 3 fatty acid feeding was only found in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (6.5 +/- 2.9% vs. 9.5 +/- 1.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was associated with a higher plasma insulin concentration (170 +/- 40 vs. 136 +/- 41 mU/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The theory that n - 3 fatty acids improve insulin sensitivity would have predicted a decrease in plasma insulin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that n - 3 fatty acids may modify insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
