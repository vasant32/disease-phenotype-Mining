<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 365 treatment-naïve patients with T2DM (HbA1c 7.0%-10.0%) were treated with saxagliptin 2.5 mg q.A.M., saxagliptin 2.5 mg q.A.M. with possible titration to saxagliptin 5 mg, saxagliptin 5 mg q.A.M., saxagliptin 5 mg q.P.M., or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After week 24, patients in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups were eligible for titration to saxagliptin 10 mg based on HbA1c ≥7%, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> unrescued placebo patients began blinded <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> 500 mg/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rescue with open-label <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> was available for patients with inadequate glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At week 24, placebo-subtracted mean HbA1c reduction from baseline (LOCF) was significantly greater in the saxagliptin treatment groups vs placebo, and remained greater through week 76 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serious adverse events (AEs) and discontinuations due to AEs were similar in saxagliptin and control groups; incidence of confirmed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> was low across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treatment groups (saxagliptin-treated, 2 [0.7]; control, 1 [1.4]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In treatment-naïve patients with T2DM, saxagliptin monotherapy demonstrated statistically significant improvement in HbA1c compared with placebo at 24 weeks and was generally well tolerated for up to 76 weeks </plain></SENT>
