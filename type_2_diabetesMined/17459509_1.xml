<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study is to compare the changes of 24-h urinary C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels according to subgroups divided by therapeutic agents for subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 206 participants, under treatment for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 24-h urinary C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels were assessed yearly for 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants were subdivided into four groups according to the therapeutic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Changes for the measured values during the follow-up were compared between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean HbA1C was 7.1% and mean 24-h UCP was 61.7 microg/24h and mean duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 8.7 years in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean 24-h UCP levels increased significantly from a baseline to at 36 months in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">insulin sensitizers</z:chebi> (IS) only group, in the IS plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> combination group and in IS plus insulin combination group (p&lt;0.001), whereas in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> only group, we could not find statistically significant changes (p=0.152) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment with only IS significantly reduced fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) and HbA1C level (p=0.045, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Differences between baseline and last 24-h UCP were significantly different between-groups and this difference was more significant after adjustment in FPG, HbA1C, and the duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (p=0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Especially, IS plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> combination group resulted in greatest increase of 24-h UCP (DeltaC-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>=51.19 microg/24h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study suggested that IS, in mono- or in combination, significantly improved pancreatic beta-cell function, especially when combined with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> as evidenced by the increase of 24-h UCP </plain></SENT>
