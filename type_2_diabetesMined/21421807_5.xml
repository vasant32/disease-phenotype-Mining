<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study included 6,580 nondiabetic Finnish men from the population-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Metabolic Syndrome</z:e> in Men (METSIM) study (aged 57 ± 7 years; BMI 26.8 ± 3.7 kg/m(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genotyping of 34 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>/type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to measure particle concentrations of 14 lipoprotein subclasses and their composition in native serum samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-increasing allele of rs780094 in GCKR was significantly associated with low concentrations of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi> particles (independently of their size) and small <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> and was nominally associated with low concentrations of intermediate-density <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> subclasses, and high concentrations of very large and large <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> particles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-increasing allele of rs174550 in FADS1 was significantly associated with high concentrations of very large and large <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> particles and nominally associated with low concentrations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi> particles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SNPs rs10923931 in NOTCH2 and rs757210 in HNF1B genes showed nominal or significant associations with several <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The genetic risk score of 34 SNPs was not associated with any of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> subclasses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Four of the 34 risk loci for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> (GCKR, FADS1, NOTCH2, and HNF1B) were significantly associated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A GCKR variant predominantly affected the concentration of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>, and the FADS1 variant affected very large and large <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> particles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only a limited number of risk loci for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>/type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> significantly affect <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
