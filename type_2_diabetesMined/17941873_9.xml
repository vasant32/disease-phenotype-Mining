<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This randomized, 34-week, parallel-group study enrolled insulin-naive, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients (HbA(1c) 7.5-12.0%) previously using two oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> (OAD) agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During an 8-week run-in period, treatment was changed to met/pio and doses were adjusted up to 2500 mg/day and 30 or 45 mg/day respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects either continued met/pio alone or added BIAsp 30 initiated at 6 units twice daily and titrated to target plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (PG) (4.4-6.1 mmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At end-of-study, subjects treated with BIAsp 30+met/pio (n = 93) had a mean (+/-s.d.) HbA(1c) reduction significantly greater than treatment with met/pio (n = 88) (1.5% +/- 1.1 vs. 0.2% +/- 0.9, p &lt; 0.0001 between groups) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subjects treated with BIAsp 30+met/pio were more likely to reach The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and European Association for the Study of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp>/American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association HbA(1c) targets of &lt; or =6.5 and &lt;7.0%, respectively, than with met/pio only (HbA(1c)&lt; or =6.5%: 59 vs. 12%; HbA(1c) &lt;7.0%: 76 vs. 24%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At end-of-study, self-monitored <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> profile values at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eight daily time points were significantly less for the BIAsp 30+met/pio group compared with the met/pio group, and minor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> (defined as PG &lt; 3.1 mmol/l) was more frequent (8.3 vs. 0.1 events/year, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both groups gained weight during treatment (BIAsp 30+met/pio, 4.6 +/- 4.3 kg; met/pio, 0.8 +/- 3.2 kg; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Addition of insulin in type 2 patients treated with met/pio is an effective way to achieve glycaemic targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment with BIAsp 30+met/pio achieved significantly greater reduction in HbA(1c), as compared with met/pio alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> poorly controlled by 2 OADs, more achieved glycaemic targets using BIAsp 30+met/pio than using met/pio alone </plain></SENT>
