<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore examined the role of TCF7L2 in hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production (HGP) in vitro and characterised the whole-genome chromatin occupancy of TCF7L2 in hepatocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We investigated the effect of TCF7L2 silencing and overexpression on HGP from gluconeogenic precursors and used chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) combined with massively parallel DNA sequencing (ChIP-Seq) to investigate the DNA binding patterns of TCF7L2 across the whole genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Silencing of TCF7L2 induced a marked increase in basal HGP, which was accompanied by significant increases in the expression of the gluconeogenic genes Fbp1, Pck1 and G6pc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of Tcf7l2 reversed this phenotype and significantly reduced HGP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TCF7L2 silencing did not affect the half-maximal inhibitory concentration of insulin or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, but HGP remained elevated in TCF7L2-silenced cells due to the increased baseline HGP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using ChIP-Seq, we detected 2,119 binding events across the genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pathway analysis demonstrated that <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> genes were significantly over-represented in the dataset </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that TCF7L2 binds directly to multiple genes that are important in regulation of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in the liver, including Pck1, Fbp1, Irs1, Irs2, Akt2, Adipor1, Pdk4 and Cpt1a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: TCF7L2 is an important regulator of HGP in vitro and binds directly to genes that are important in pathways of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in the liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data highlight the possibility that TCF7L2 may affect fasting and postprandial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> in carriers of at-risk TCF7L2 genetic polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
