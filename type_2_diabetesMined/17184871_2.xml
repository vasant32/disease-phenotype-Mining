<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two hundreds and ten diabetic patients were consecutively enrolled over a 6-month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A questionnaire was administered and physical examination done </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The JNC VI and the latest WHO criteria were used to diagnose <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, respectively, and control of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was assessed against five different targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ninety-one percent of the participants had type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prevalence and awareness rates for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> were 66.7% (n=140) and 87.1% (n=122), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment rate among those aware of their <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> status was 80.3% (n=98) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> were older, more overweight/<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and had a longer duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitors</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretics</z:chebi> were the two most used blood pressure (BP) lowering drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Following the <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi>/JNC 7 goal, the control rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> among treated patients was 10.2% (n=10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Diabetic patients in Cameroon exhibit a very high prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and are about three times more affected than the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Awareness and treatment rates are high, but the control rate is very low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Large scale studies with intervention component are urgently required </plain></SENT>
