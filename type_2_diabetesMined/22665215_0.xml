<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In total, 4,798 drug-naive Japanese patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were registered on their first clinic/hospital visits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Conventional clinical factors and fasting insulin levels were observed at baseline within the Japan <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Clinical Data Management (JDDM) study between consecutive 2-year groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multiple linear regression analysis was performed using a model in which the dependent variable was fasting insulin values using various clinical explanatory variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fasting insulin levels were found to be decreasing from 2000 to 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multiple linear regression analysis with the fasting insulin levels as the dependent variable showed that waist circumference (WC), BMI, mean blood pressure, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> were significant, with WC and BMI as the main factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ANCOVA after adjustment for age and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> clearly shows the decreasing trend in fasting insulin levels and the increasing trend in BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: During the 10-year observation period, the decreasing trend in fasting insulin was related to the slight increase in WC/BMI in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Low pancreatic Î²-cell reserve on top of a lifestyle background might be dependent on an increase in MRFs </plain></SENT>
