<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Current treatment pathways advocate a failure-driven therapy algorithm for blood-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> lowering that leads to the sequential addition of therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The addition and combination of multiple blood-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> lowering agents may be associated with significant side effects, such as <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e>, resulting in a detrimental quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study is to quantify the overall costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) associated with therapy escalation via oral only treatment strategies with different adverse event profiles as a function of target HbA1c achievement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A previously published model was adapted to run as a non-terminating simulation model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The model is designed to evaluate the cost utility of treatment strategies in a population of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Model outputs include incidence of micro- and macrovascular complications, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-specific and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The total number of vascular events predicted by the model varied little across the four treatment strategies because of the glycaemic profile associated with each therapy strategy being similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The strategy with sequential addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> (TZDs) and sulphonylureas (SUs) to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (MF) was associated with greatest predicted <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The addition of SU and dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP-4) inhibitors to MF was associated with the highest estimated QALYs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A treatment strategy involving the sequential addition of SU and TZD to first-line MF therapy is associated with the lowest cost and lowest gain across a population, whereas addition of TZD and SU sequentially to first-line MF therapy resulted in the highest cost and incrementally less QALY gain when compared with treatment strategies involving the addition of a DPP-4 inhibitor and SU to first-line MF (irrespective of the treatment sequence) that were associated with both less cost and greatest QALY gain </plain></SENT>
