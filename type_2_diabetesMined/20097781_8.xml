<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Sixteen individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 21 age-matched control subjects (aged 50-75 years) participated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Postural stability and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> risk was assessed before and after a 6-week exercise program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Diabetic individuals had significantly higher <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> risk score compared with control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diabetic group also exhibited evidence of mild-to-moderate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e>, slower reaction times, and increased postural sway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Following exercise, the diabetic group showed significant improvements in leg strength, faster reaction times, decreased sway, and, consequently, reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Older individuals with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had <z:mp ids='MP_0001525'>impaired balance</z:mp>, slower reactions, and consequently a higher <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> risk than age-matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these variables improved after resistance/balance training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Together these results demonstrate that structured exercise has wide-spread positive effects on physiological function for older individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
