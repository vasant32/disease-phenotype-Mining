<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Contributing factors include <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and a central pattern of fat accumulation with a strong genetic component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The adipocyte secreted hormone resistin has been proposed as a link between the adipocyte and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> by inhibition of insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake and/or blocking adipocyte differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we report that the G/G genotype of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the promoter of the human resistin gene, -180C&gt;G, had significantly increased basal promoter activity in adipocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data were recapitulated in vivo, where G/G homozygotes had significantly higher resistin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels in human abdominal subcutaneous fat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significant interaction was also found between the -180C&gt;G SNP, a marker of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="13389">NAD</z:chebi>[P]H <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36141">quinone</z:chebi> oxidoreductase <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>) and homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, resistin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was positively and independently correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and hepatic fat as measured by liver X-ray attenuation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data implicate resistin in the pathophysiology of the human <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> syndrome, an effect mediated by the -180C&gt;G promoter SNP and potentially cellular <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
