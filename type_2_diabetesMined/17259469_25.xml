<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed the relationship between patients' initial medication adherence and subsequent regimen intensification among patients with persistently elevated A1C levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed an inception cohort of 2,065 insured patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were newly started on hypoglycemic therapy and were followed for at least 3 years between 1992 and 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Medication adherence was assessed by taking the ratio of medication days dispensed (from pharmacy records) to medication days prescribed (as documented in the medical record) for the first prescribed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic drug</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adherence was measured for the period between medication initiation and the next elevated A1C result measured at least 3 months later; intensification was defined as a dose increase or the addition of a second <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agent</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients were aged (mean +/- SD) 55.4 +/- 12.2 years; 53% were men, and 19% were black </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Baseline medication adherence was 79.8 +/- 19.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients in the lowest quartile of adherence were significantly less likely to have their regimens increased within 12 months of their first elevated A1C compared with patients in the highest quartile (27 vs. 37%, respectively, with increased regimens if A1C is elevated, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In multivariate models adjusting for patient demographic and treatment factors, patients in the highest adherence quartile had 53% greater odds of medication intensification after an elevated A1C (95% CI 1.11-1.93, P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among insured diabetic patients with elevated A1C, level of medication adherence predicted subsequent medication intensification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Poor patient self-management behavior increases therapeutic clinical inertia </plain></SENT>
