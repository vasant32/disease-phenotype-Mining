<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim was to establish mortality rates in a cohort of subjects with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> over 10 years in Canterbury, New Zealand (NZ) and to determine baseline prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subjects (447) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (208 male, 239 female; age range 30-82 years, median 62 years; of predominantly European origin) were characterised in a clinic survey in 1989 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Individual status (dead or alive) at June 1 1999 (10 year follow-up) was ascertained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mortality rates were compared with the general NZ population and the relative risk (RR) of baseline prognostic factors evaluated with Cox's proportional hazards model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 10 years, 232 subjects were confirmed as alive and 187 as dead - only 28 were untraceable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ten year survival was 55% (95% CI: 50-60) for the cohort, compared with 70% (95% CI: 65-75) at 6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Factors assessed at baseline (1989), that were independently prognostic of total mortality, included age (RR 2.0, 95% CI: 1.6-2.5), pre-existing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD; RR 1.7, 95% CI: 1.2-2.4) and <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> (RR 1.58, 95% CI: 1.1-2.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> was not a significant predictor of total mortality, although was a predictor of CAD mortality in those subjects free of CAD in 1989 (RR 1.6, 95% CI: 1.1-2.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the latter subset, independent prognostic factors for CAD mortality also included age (RR 2.5, 95% CI: 1.7-3.8), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (RR 1.9, 95% CI: 1.0-3.7), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo> (RR 2.4, 95% CI: 1.3-4.5) and smoking (RR 2.6, 95% CI: 1.2-5.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Increased mortality in type 2 diabetic subjects is therefore attributable to multiple risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Improved outcomes will depend on interventions targeted at glycaemic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other remediable factors </plain></SENT>
