<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The xylosyltransferases (XTs) are the initial and rate-limiting enzymes in the biosynthesis of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18085">glycosaminoglycan</z:chebi> chains in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycans</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we analyzed whether the changed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycan</z:chebi> metabolism leads to altered serum XT levels in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Serum XT activity was determined in 100 diabetic patients and 100 blood donors using a novel high-performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum XT activities in male and female diabetic patients were significantly decreased compared with those in the corresponding normoglycemic control subjects (mean +/- SD: male patients, 19.3 +/- 4.44 mU/l; male nondiabetic control subjects, 26.6 +/- 2.79 mU/l; female patients, 18.9 +/- 3.14 mU/l; female nondiabetic control subjects, 21.8 +/- 3.74 mU/l; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were detected between patients with type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data show decreased XT activity in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, a disease that is accompanied by an altered <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycan</z:chebi> biosynthesis </plain></SENT>
