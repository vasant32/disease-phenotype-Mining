<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ala203Pro, a common variant in the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi>-1beta gene is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate whether the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi>-1beta Ala203Pro polymorphism influences the age-related decline in skeletal muscle <z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi>-1beta expression, in vivo metabolism and markers for muscle fibre type composition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The <z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi>-1beta Ala203Pro polymorphism was genotyped in 110 young (age 28.0 +/- 1.9 years) and 86 elderly (age 62.4 +/- 2.0 years) twins and related to muscle <z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi>-1beta expression, in vivo metabolism and markers for fibre type composition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Insulin-stimulated non-oxidative <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism (NOGM; p = 0.025) and glycolytic flux rate (GF; p = 0.026) were reduced in young Ala/Ala carriers compared with carriers of a 203Pro allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, a regression analysis, correcting for covariates, showed that the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi>-1beta 203Pro allele was positively related to insulin-stimulated NOGM and GF in the young twins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While muscle expression of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi>-1beta was reduced in elderly compared with young carriers of the Ala/Ala genotype (p &lt; or = 0.001), there was no significant age-related decline in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi>-1beta expression in carriers of the 203Pro allele (p &gt; or = 0.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, a regression analysis, correcting for covariates, showed that only age was significantly related to muscle <z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi>-1beta expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi>-1beta expression correlated positively with markers for oxidative fibres in human muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: This study suggests that young carriers of a <z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi>-1beta 203Pro allele have enhanced insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism and may be protected against an age-related decline in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi>-1beta expression in muscle </plain></SENT>
