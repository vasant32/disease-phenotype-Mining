<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess, in an older population, the prevalence of diagnosed and undiagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the number needed to screen (NNTS) to identify one individual with undiagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and factors associated with undiagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Socioeconomic and health-related factors were assessed at the baseline examination of the Health, Aging, and Body Composition (Health ABC) Study, a cohort of 3,075 well-functioning people aged 70-79 years living in Memphis, Tennessee and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (42% blacks and 48% men) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> was defined according to the 1985 World Health Organization criteria (fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &gt; or =7.8 mmol/l or 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &gt; or =11.1 mmol/l) and the 1997 American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association criteria (fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &gt; or =7.0 mmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of diagnosed and undiagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 15.6 and 8.0%, respectively, among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants (NNTS 10.6), 13.9 and 9.1% among white men (NNTS 9.5), 7.8 and 7.4% among white women (NNTS 12.4), 22.7 and 9.1% among black men (NNTS 8.5), and 21.6 and 6.2% among black women (NNTS 12.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analyses, compared with individuals without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, individuals with undiagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were more likely to be men and were more likely to have a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, higher BMI, and larger waist circumference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>NNTS was lowest in men (9.1), individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (8.7), individuals in the highest BMI quartile (6.9), and individuals in the largest waist circumference quartile (6.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In approximately one-third of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> older people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the condition remains undiagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Screening for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may be more efficient among men and individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, high BMI, and large waist circumference </plain></SENT>
