<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the predictors of intensification of antihyperglycemic therapy in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; its impact on A1C, body weight, symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and health status; and patient characteristics associated with improvement in A1C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed survey, medical record, and health plan administrative data collected in Translating Research into Action for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> (TRIAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined patients who were using diet/exercise or oral antihyperglycemic medications at baseline, had A1C &gt;7.2%, and stayed with the same therapy or intensified therapy (initiated or increased the number of classes of oral antihyperglycemic medications or began insulin) over 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 1,093 patients, 520 intensified therapy with oral medications or insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients intensifying therapy were aged 58 +/- 12 years, had <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration of 11 +/- 9 years, and had A1C of 9.1 +/- 1.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Younger age and higher A1C were associated with therapy intensification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with patients who did not intensify therapy, those who intensified therapy experienced a 0.49% reduction in A1C (P &lt; 0.0001), a 3-pound increase in weight (P = 0.003), and no change in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (P = 0.5) or health status (P = 0.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among those who intensified therapy, improvement in A1C was associated with higher baseline A1C, older age, black race/ethnicity, lower income, and more physician visits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Treatment intensification improved glycemic control with no worsening of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> or health status, especially in elderly, lower-income, and minority patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interventions are needed to overcome clinical inertia when patients might benefit from treatment intensification and improved glycemic control </plain></SENT>
