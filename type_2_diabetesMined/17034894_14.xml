<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants in a health survey conducted during 1989-2000 (n=33,336) in Ume√• in northern Sweden, were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We identified 191 cases, who were not diabetic initially but were diagnosed with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after 5.4+/-2.6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two age- and sex-matched referents were selected for each case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression analyses and interaction effects between variables were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In women, passive or tense working situations were associated with future type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with odds ratios 3.6 (95% confidence interval 1.1-11.7) and 3.6 (1.0-13.3), respectively, and also low emotional support 3.0 (1.3-7.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These associations were not seen in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In women, they remained after adjustment for BMI, civil status and educational level, and there were also tendencies for interactions between work stress and low emotional support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, work stress and low emotional support may increase the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in women, but not in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings contribute to our understanding of psychosocial stress as potential risk factors for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a Swedish population </plain></SENT>
