<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this Perspectives in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> article, we highlight the contrast between the relatively large body of information that is available in regard to signaling pathways, proteins, and mechanisms that together provide a road map for efforts to regenerate β-cells in rodents versus the scant information in human β-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To reverse the state of ignorance regarding human β-cell signaling, we suggest a series of questions for consideration by the scientific community to construct a human β-cell proliferation road map </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The hope is that the knowledge from the new studies will allow the community to move faster towards developing therapeutic approaches to enhance human β-cell mass in the long-term goal of preventing and/or curing type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
