<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to define the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> on the expression of genes related to carbohydrate and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism in subcutaneous fat obtained from type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Forty-eight volunteers with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were divided into two groups treated for 12 weeks with placebo or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (30 mg/day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expression of several genes was quantified by real-time RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">Pioglitazone</z:chebi> treatment increased the expression of genes involved in <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi>-3-phosphate synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of PEPCK-C and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi>-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) increased (P &lt; 0.01) in patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> kinase (GyK) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expression of genes that regulate fatty acid availability in adipocytes, including <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> lipase (LPL) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15351">acetyl-CoA</z:chebi> synthetase (ACS), was higher (P &lt; 0.01) in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>-treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">Pioglitazone</z:chebi> stimulated (P &lt; 0.0001) expression of c-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28911">Cbl</z:chebi>-associated protein (CAP), whereas <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha, leptin, resistin, angiopoietin like-4, and 11-beta-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35350">hydroxysteroid</z:chebi> dehydrogenase type 1 (11beta HSD 1) were not affected by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The baseline peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was significantly correlated with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> for LPL, CAP, ACS, 11beta HSD 1, GyK, fatty acid synthase, leptin, and GPDH, whereas PPAR-gamma2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was correlated with CAP, PEPCK-C, leptin, and GPDH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0004324'>increased body weight</z:hpo>, and this is associated with upregulation of some, but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, genes previously demonstrated as "TZD responsive" in subcutaneous fat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that TZDs might increase body weight through the upregulation of genes facilitating adipocyte <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> storage in vivo </plain></SENT>
