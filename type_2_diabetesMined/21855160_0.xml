<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is unclear whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> treatment alters serum ghrelin levels in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-four subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were randomly assigned to receive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> or medical nutrition therapy (MNT) for 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Changes in anthropometric variables, glycemic control, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> parameters, and total ghrelin levels were evaluated at baseline and following 12 weeks of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant decreases in body weight and body mass index were observed over the entire study period in both treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> and postprandial plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were statistically significant decreased in the groups receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> compared with baseline values (p=0.021 and p=0.021, respectively), while they were unchanged in the groups receiving MNT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a significant decrease in total ghrelin in the groups receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> (p=0.04) compared with baseline values but not in the groups receiving MNT (p=0.46) at the end of the 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this study of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> was associated with a significant decrease in serum ghrelin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the neutral effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> on weight might be associated with the suppression of fasting serum ghrelin levels </plain></SENT>
