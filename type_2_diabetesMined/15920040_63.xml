<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Barriers to optimal insulin therapy include <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>, and suboptimal initiation and dose titration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study compared two treatment algorithms for insulin glargine initiation and titration: algorithm 1 (investigator led) versus algorithm 2 (performed by study subjects) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A prospective, multicenter (n = 611), multinational (n = 59), open-label, 24-week randomized trial in 4,961 (algorithm 1, n = 2,493; algorithm 2, n = 2,468) suboptimally controlled type 2 diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, mean <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration was 12.3 +/- 7.2 years, and 72% of subjects were pretreated with insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At end point, there was no significant difference in the incidence of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> between algorithms 1 and 2 (0.9 vs. 1.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a significant reduction in HbA(1c) from 8.9 +/- 1.3 to 7.8 +/- 1.2%, with a greater decrease (P &lt; 0.001) with algorithm 2 (-1.22%) versus algorithm 1 (-1.08%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> decreased from 170 to 110 mg/dl, with a greater decrease (P &lt; 0.001) with algorithm 2 (-62 mg/dl) versus algorithm 1 (-57 mg/dl) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean basal insulin dose increased from 22.9 +/- 15.5 to 43.0 +/- 25.5 IU, with a significant difference (P &lt; 0.003) between algorithm 2 (21.6 IU) and algorithm 1 (18.7 IU) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Glargine is safe and effective in improving glycemic control in a large, diverse population with longstanding type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A simple subject-administered titration algorithm conferred significantly improved glycemic control with a low incidence of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> compared with physician-managed titration </plain></SENT>
