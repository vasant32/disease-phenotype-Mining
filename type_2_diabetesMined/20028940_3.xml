<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE Using the clamp technique, youths with a clinical diagnosis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (CDx-type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) and positive pancreatic autoantibodies (Ab(+)) were shown to have severe impairment in insulin secretion and less <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> than their peers with negative antibodies (Ab(-)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated whether oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT)-derived indexes of insulin secretion and sensitivity could distinguish between these two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A total of 25 Ab(-), 11 Ab(+) CDx-type 2 diabetic, and 21 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> control youths had an OGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fasting and OGTT-derived indexes of insulin sensitivity (including the Matsuda index, homeostasis model assessment [HOMA] of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, quantitative insulin sensitivity check index, and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-to-insulin ratio) and insulin secretion (HOMA of insulin secretion and 30-min insulogenic and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> indexes) were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Glucagon and glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (GLP)-1 responses were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS Fasting C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-to-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> ratio, and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> area under the curve (AUC) were significantly lower in the Ab(+) CDx-type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other OGTT-derived surrogate indexes of insulin sensitivity and secretion were not different between the Ab(+) versus Ab(-) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>GLP-1 during the OGTT was highest in the Ab(+) youths compared with the other two groups, but this difference disappeared after adjusting for BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ab(+) and Ab(-) CDx-type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had relative hyperglucagonemia compared with control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS The clinical measures of fasting and OGTT-derived surrogate indexes of insulin sensitivity and secretion, except for fasting C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> AUC, are less sensitive tools to distinguish metabolic/pathopysiological differences, detected by the clamp, between Ab(+) and Ab(-) CDx-type 2 diabetic youths </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This underscores the importance of using more sensitive methods and the importance of determining antibody status in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> youths with CDx-type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
