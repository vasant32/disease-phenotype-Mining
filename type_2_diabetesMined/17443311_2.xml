<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite several reports of association of the G972R polymorphism in its gene IRS1 with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we and others have not observed this association in well-powered samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, other nearby variants might account for the putative association signal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We characterised the haplotype map of IRS1 and selected 20 markers designed to capture common variations in the region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We genotyped this comprehensive set of markers in several family-based and case-control samples of European descent totalling 12,129 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In an initial sample of 2,235 North American and Polish case-control pairs, the minor allele of the rs934167 polymorphism showed nominal evidence of association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (odds ratio [OR] 1.25, 95% CI 1.03-1.51, p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This association showed a trend in the same direction in 7,659 Scandinavian samples (OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.96-1.39, p = 0.059) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The combined OR was 1.20 (p = 0.008), but statistical correction for the number of variants examined yielded a p value of 0.086 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We detected no differences across rs934167 genotypes in insulin-related quantitative traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our data do not support an association of common variants in IRS1 with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in populations of European descent </plain></SENT>
