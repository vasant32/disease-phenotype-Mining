<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether HHEX-IDE and CDKAL1 genes, which are associated with birth weight and susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, continue to influence growth during childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: BMI, weight, and height at age 8 years expressed as age- and sex-corrected standard deviation scores (<z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>) against national reference data and single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping of HHEX-IDE and CDKAL1 loci were analyzed in 646 prospectively followed children in the German BABYDIAB cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> children were singleton full-term births; 386 had mothers with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and 260 had fathers with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and a nondiabetic mother </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk alleles at the HHEX-IDE locus were associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0006086'>reduced BMI</z:mp>-<z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> at age 8 years (0.17 SDS per allele; P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After stratification for birth weight, both HHEX-IDE and CDKAL1 risk alleles were associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0006086'>reduced BMI</z:mp>-<z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> (0.45 SDS, P = 0.0002; 0.52 SDS, P = 0.0001) and weight-<z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> (0.22 SDS, P = 0.04; 0.56 SDS, P = 0.0002) in children born <z:hpo ids='HP_0001520'>large for gestational age</z:hpo> (&gt;90th percentile) but not children born small or appropriate for gestational age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Within children born <z:hpo ids='HP_0001520'>large for gestational age</z:hpo>, BMI and weight decreased with each additional type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk allele ( approximately -2 kg per allele; &gt;8 kg overall) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Findings were consistent in children of mothers with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P &lt; 0.0001) and children of nondiabetic mothers (P = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility alleles at HHEX-IDE and CDKAL1 loci are associated with low BMI at age 8 years in children who were born <z:hpo ids='HP_0001520'>large for gestational age</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
