<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare the prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in white Europeans and individuals of African-Caribbean and Pakistani descent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Random sampling of population-based registers in inner-city Manchester, Britain's third most impoverished area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 1,318 people (25-79 years of age) were screened (minimum response 67%); 533 individuals without known <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> underwent 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance testing, classified by 1999 World Health Organization criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: More than 60% of individuals reported household annual income &lt; pound10,000 ($15,000) per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Energetic physical activity was rare and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> was common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Age-standardized (35-79 years) prevalence (mean 95% CI) of known and newly detected <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 20% (17-24%) in Europeans, 22% (18-26%) in African-Caribbeans, and 33% (25-41%) in Pakistanis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Minimum prevalence (assuming <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> individuals not tested were normoglycemic) was 11% (8-14%), 19% (15-23%), and 32% (24-40%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Marked changes in prevalence represent only small shifts in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> distributions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Regression models showed that greater waist girth, lower height, and older age were independently related to plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, as was physical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Substituting BMI and waist-to-hip ratio revealed their powerful contribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A surprisingly high prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, despite expected increases with new lower criteria, was found in Europeans, as previously established in Caribbeans and Pakistanis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Lower height eliminated ethnic differences in regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>History and relative poverty, which cosegregate with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and physical inactivity, are likely contributors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Whatever the causes, the implications for health services are alarming, although substantial preventive opportunities through small reversals of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> distributions are the challenge </plain></SENT>
