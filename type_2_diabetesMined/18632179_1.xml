<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined whether serum apoB48 level is associated with the presence of carotid plaque in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Forty type 2 diabetic patients (21 males and 19 females, 52.8+/-11.8 years old; mean+/-S.D.) were divided into two groups by the presence or absence of carotid plaque </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diurnal change of serum apoB48 level was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fasting serum apoB48 level was higher in the subjects with carotid plaque than those without (6.5+/-3.8vs. 4.1+/-1.9 microg/ml, p=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Age- and gender-adjusted analysis showed that the presence of carotid plaque was associated with fasting apoB48 (OR 1.43; 95% CI, 1.07-2.09, p=0.04) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> (OR 1.14; 95% CI, 1.02-1.32, p=0.04) levels </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Serum apoB48 level was strongly associated with the presence of carotid plaque in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
