<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The KK/Ta mouse strain serves as a suitable polygenic model for human type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using 93 microsatellite markers in 208 KK/Ta x (BALB/c x KK/Ta)F1 male backcross mice, we carried out a genome-wide linkage analysis of KK/Ta alleles contributing to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and related phenotypes, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We identified three major chromosomal intervals significantly contributing to impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism: one quantitative trait locus for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> on chromosome 6 and two loci for fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels on chromosomes 12 and 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The latter two loci appeared to act in a complementary fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two intervals showed significant linkages for serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels, one on chromosome 4 and the other on chromosome 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The KK allele on chromosome 8 acts to promote serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels, whereas the KK allele on chromosome 4 acts to suppress this effect in a recessive fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, it is suggested that the chromosome 4 locus also acts to downregulate body weight and that the chromosome 8 locus acts to upregulate serum insulin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data clearly showed that each disease phenotype of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and related disorders in KK/Ta mice is under the control of separate genetic mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, there appear to be common genes contributing to different disease phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There are potentially important candidate genes that may be relevant to the disease </plain></SENT>
