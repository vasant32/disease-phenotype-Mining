<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine the role of ERK1 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in vivo, we inactivated Erk1 (also known as Mapk3) in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> leptin-deficient mice (ob/ob) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Mice of genotype ob/ob-Erk1⁻(/)⁻ were obtained by crossing Erk1⁻(/)⁻ mice with ob/ob mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> tolerance and insulin sensitivity were studied in 12-week-old mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tissue-specific insulin sensitivity, insulin signalling, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>liver steatosis</z:hpo> and adipose tissue <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: While ob/ob-Erk1⁻(/)⁻ and ob/ob mice exhibited comparable body weight and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e>, ob/ob-Erk1⁻(/)⁻ mice did not develop <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> and their <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance was improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp studies demonstrated an increase in whole-body insulin sensitivity in the ob/ob-Erk1⁻(/)⁻ mice associated with an increase in both insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal in skeletal muscles and adipose tissue insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This occurred in parallel with improved insulin signalling in both tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ob/ob-Erk1⁻(/)⁻ mice were also partially protected against <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>hepatic steatosis</z:hpo> with a strong reduction in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15351">acetyl-CoA</z:chebi> carboxylase level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These metabolic improvements were associated with reduced expression of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> encoding inflammatory cytokine and T lymphocyte markers in the adipose tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our results demonstrate that the targeting of ERK1 could partially protect <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> mice against <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>liver steatosis</z:hpo> by decreasing adipose tissue <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and by increasing muscle <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that deregulation of the ERK1 pathway could be an important component in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
