<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RBP4 levels correlate with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, BMI, WHR, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidaemia</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Improvement of insulin sensitivity with exercise training is associated with reduction in serum RBP4 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore serum RBP4 may be useful for early diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and for monitoring improvements in insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine the performance of assays for this application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We compared quantitative western blotting and three commercially available multiwell immunoassays in parallel measurements of RBP4 concentrations in serum from insulin-sensitive subjects and from insulin-resistant subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The assays yielded different absolute values and magnitudes of elevation of serum RBP4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Western blotting and a sandwich ELISA reported RBP4 concentrations that highly inversely correlated with insulin sensitivity measured by euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, western blotting yielded concentrations with a greater dynamic range and less overlap between control and insulin-resistant subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two competitive enzyme-linked immunoassays undervalued serum RBP4 concentrations in insulin-resistant subjects, possibly due to assay saturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Poor linearity of dilution also limited assay utility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> assays tested exhibited greater immunoreactivity with urinary (C-terminal proteolysed) RBP4 than with full-length RBP4, the predominant form in serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATIONS: These findings support the use of quantitative western blotting standardised to full-length RBP4 protein as a 'gold standard' method for measuring serum RBP4 in insulin-resistant states </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Other assays should use full-length RBP4 and be extensively cross-validated using other methods </plain></SENT>
