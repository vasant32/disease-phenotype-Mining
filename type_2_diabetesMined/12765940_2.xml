<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> derived periportally via gluconeogenesis is partially taken up perivenously in perfused liver but not in adult rats whose mothers were protein-restricted during gestation (MLP rats)-an environmental model of fetal programming of adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> exhibiting diminished perivenous glucokinase (GK) activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We now show that perivenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake rises with increasing <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration (0-8 mmol/l) in control but not MLP liver, indicating that GK is flux-generating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The data demonstrate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> control of hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> output is principally achieved by increasing perivenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake, with rising <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration during refeeding, rather than by downregulation of gluconeogenesis, which occurs in different hepatocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Consistent with these observations, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthesis in vivo commenced in the perivenous cells during refeeding, MLP livers accumulating less <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>GK gene transcription was unchanged in MLP liver, the data supporting a recently proposed posttranscriptional model of GK regulation involving nuclear-cytoplasmic transport </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results are pertinent to impaired regulation of hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> output in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, which could arise from diminished GK-mediated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake rather than increased gluconeogenesis </plain></SENT>
