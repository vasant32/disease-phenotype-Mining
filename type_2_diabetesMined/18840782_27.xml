<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We used a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) map in a large cohort of 580 African American families to identify regions linked to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, age of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosis, and BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: After removing outliers and problematic samples, we conducted linkage analysis using 5,914 SNPs in 1,344 individuals from 530 families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Linkage analysis was conducted using variance components for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, age of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosis, and BMI and nonparametric linkage analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ordered subset analyses were conducted ranking on age of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosis, BMI, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and amount of European admixture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Admixture mapping was conducted using 4,486 markers not in linkage disequilibrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The strongest signal for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (logarithm of odds [LOD] 4.53) was a broad peak on chromosome 2, with weaker linkage to age of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosis (LOD 1.82) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and age of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosis were linked to chromosome 13p (3-22 cM; LOD 2.42 and 2.46, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Age of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosis was linked to 18p (66 cM; LOD 2.96) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We replicated previous reports on chromosome 7p (79 cM; LOD 2.93) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ordered subset analysis did not overlap with linkage of unselected families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The best admixture score was on chromosome 12 (90 cM; P = 0.0003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The linkage regions on chromosomes 7 (27-78 cM) and 18p overlap prior reports, whereas regions on 2p and 13p linkage are novel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Among potential candidate genes implicated are TCF7L1, VAMP5, VAMP8, CDK8, INSIG2, IPF1, PAX8, IL18R1, members of the IL1 and IL1 receptor families, and MAP4K4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These studies provide a complementary approach to genome-wide association scans to identify causative genes for African American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
