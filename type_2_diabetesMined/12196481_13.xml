<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relevance to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> of the common polymorphism Glu23Lys in the <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> inward rectifier 6.2 (KIR6.2) gene is still controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess whether this polymorphism influences beta-cell function, alpha-cell function, or insulin action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We therefore studied 298 nondiabetic subjects using an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) and 75 nondiabetic subjects using a hyperglycemic clamp (10 mmol/l) with additional glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (GLP)-1 and arginine stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of the Lys allele was approximately 37%, and the Lys allele was associated with higher incremental plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> during the OGTT (P = 0.03, ANOVA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neither first- nor second-phase <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> secretion was affected by the presence of the polymorphism; nor were maximal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-, GLP-1-, or arginine-induced C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> secretion rates; nor was insulin sensitivity (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &gt; 0.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the relative decrease in plasma glucagon concentrations during the 10 min after the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> challenge was reduced in carriers of the Lys allele (10 +/- 3% decrease from baseline in Lys/Lys, 18 +/- 2% in Glu/Lys, and 20 +/- 2% in Glu/Glu; P = 0.01, ANOVA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our findings suggest that the common Glu23Lys polymorphism in KIR6.2 is not necessarily associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta-cell dysfunction</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> but with diminished suppression of glucagon secretion in response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings thus confirm its functional relevance for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in humans </plain></SENT>
