<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate A1C for screening and diagnosis of undiagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> defined by oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance testing in clinical and general populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A1C cut offs (&lt; or =5.5% to rule out <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; &gt; or =7.0% to rule in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) were derived from a clinical group (Melbourne Pathology [MP] group: n = 2,494; undiagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> 34.6%) and then evaluated in a population-based sample (AusDiab group: n = 6,015; undiagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> 4.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the MP and AusDiab groups, A1C at 5.5% gave sensitivities of 98.7 and 83.5%, while A1C at 7.0% gave specificities of 98.2 and 100%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Many (61.9-69.3%) with impaired A1C (5.6-6.9%) in both populations had abnormal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A1C &lt; or =5.5% and &gt; or =7.0% predicts absence or presence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, respectively, while at A1C 6.5-6.9% <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is highly probable in clinical and population settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A high proportion of people with impaired A1C have abnormal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> status requiring follow-up </plain></SENT>
