<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>Diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> is an important and increasing cause of morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Accurate epidemiological studies are often logistically and financially difficult, but processes of rural-urban migration and epidemiological transition are certainly increasing the prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Type 1 disease is relatively rare, although this may be related to high mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This diabetic subgroup appears to present at a later age (by about a decade) than in Western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Variant forms of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are also described in the continent; notably 'atypical, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001946'>ketosis</z:hpo>-prone' <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004395'>malnutrition</z:hpo>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These types sometimes make the distinction between type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, this is also a current experience in the developed world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As more detailed and reliable complication studies emerge, it is increasingly apparent that African <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is associated with a high complication burden, which is both difficult to treat and prevent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>More optimistically, a number of intervention studies and twinning projects are showing real benefits in varying locations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Future improvements depend on practical and sustainable support, coupled with local acceptance of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> as a major threat to the future health and quality of life of sub-Saharan Africans </plain></SENT>
