<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He was a recipient of renal transplantation treated with metyl-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> and tacrolimus regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The serum level of tacrolimus was 12.4 ng/ml, and he showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002591'>hyperphagia</z:hpo> before a month of admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A week before admission, he was aware of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001959'>polydipsia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000103'>polyuria</z:hpo>, and general <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>He visited our hospital and was found to have severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> (925 mg/dl), significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001946'>ketosis</z:hpo> and mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001942'>metabolic acidosis</z:hpo> (pH 7.341), although he had not been diagnosed as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
