<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two hundred and sixty-nine patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were enrolled </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The serum hsCRP concentrations and the 24 h urine albumin excretion amounts were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ophthalmoscope examinations and nerve conduction velocity tests were performed to evaluate microvascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The hsCRP was significantly higher in the patients with MS than in those without (p=0.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The serum hsCRP was significantly correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the components of MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no differences between the serum hsCRP levels of those with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The serum hsCRP was correlated with the 24 h urine albumin excretion amount </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Among microvascular complications, only diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> is associated with the serum hsCRP level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It suggests that the inflammatory process plays a role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
