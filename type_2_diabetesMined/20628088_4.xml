<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Herein we assess the relationship of maternal blood and food AGEs to circulating glycoxidants, inflammatory markers, and insulin levels in infants up to age 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: AGEs (N(ε)-carboxymethyllysine [<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>] and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17158">methylglyoxal</z:chebi> derivatives) were tested in sera of healthy mothers in labor (n = 60), their infants, and infant foods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33023">8-isoprostane</z:chebi>, fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, leptin, and adiponectin levels were assessed in 12-month-old infants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant correlations were found between newborn and maternal serum <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> (sCML) (r = 0.734, P = 0.001) serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17158">methylglyoxal</z:chebi> derivatives (sMGs) (r = 0.593, P = 0.001), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33023">8-isoprostanes</z:chebi> (r = 0.644, P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Infant adiponectin at 12 months negatively correlated with maternal sCML (r = -0.467, P = 0.011), whereas high maternal sMGs predicted higher infant insulin or homeostasis model assessment (P = 0.027) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Infant sAGEs significantly increased with the initiation of processed infant food intake, raising daily AGE consumption by ∼7.5-fold in year 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Maternal blood and food-derived AGEs prematurely raise AGEs in children to adult norms, preconditioning them to abnormally high oxidant stress and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and thus possibly to early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of disease, such as <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
