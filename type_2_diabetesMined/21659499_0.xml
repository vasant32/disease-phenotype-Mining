<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We have previously shown that overexpression of the Na-Ca exchanger (NCX1), a protein responsible for Ca(2+) extrusion from cells, increases β-cell programmed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>) and reduces β-cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To further characterize the role of NCX1 in β-cells under in vivo conditions, we developed and characterized mice deficient for NCX1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Biologic and morphologic methods (Ca(2+) imaging, Ca(2+) uptake, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism, insulin release, and point counting morphometry) were used to assess β-cell function in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin levels were measured to assess <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism and insulin sensitivity in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Islets were transplanted under the kidney capsule to assess their performance to revert <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in alloxan-diabetic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Heterozygous inactivation of Ncx1 in mice induced an increase in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced insulin release, with a major enhancement of its first and second phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was paralleled by an increase in β-cell proliferation and mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mutation also increased β-cell insulin content, proinsulin immunostaining, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced Ca(2+) uptake, and β-cell resistance to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, Ncx1(+/-) islets showed a two- to four-times higher rate of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> cure than Ncx1(+/+) islets when transplanted into diabetic animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Downregulation of the Na/Ca exchanger leads to an increase in β-cell function, proliferation, mass, and resistance to physiologic stress, namely to various changes in β-cell function that are opposite to the major abnormalities seen in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This provides a unique model for the prevention and treatment of β-cell dysfunction in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and after islet transplantation </plain></SENT>
