<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Subjects (n = 54) were given a high-fat meal (75 g fat, 5 g carbohydrate, 6 g protein) after an overnight fast (nonobese control [NOC]: age 39.9 ± 11.8 years [mean ± SD], BMI 24.9 ± 3.2 kg/m(2), n = 9; <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>: age 43.8 ± 9.5 years, BMI 33.3 ± 2.5 kg/m(2), n = 15; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> [IGT]: age 41.7 ± 11.3 years, BMI 32.0 ± 4.5 kg/m(2), n = 12; type 2 diabetic: age 45.4 ± 10.1 years, BMI 30.3 ± 4.5 kg/m(2), n = 18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blood was collected before (0 h) and after the meal (1-4 h) for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Baseline endotoxin was significantly higher in the type 2 diabetic and IGT subjects than in NOC subjects, with baseline circulating endotoxin levels 60.6% higher in type 2 diabetic subjects than in NOC subjects (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ingestion of a high-fat meal led to a significant rise in endotoxin levels in type 2 diabetic, IGT, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects over the 4-h time period (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings also showed that, at 4 h after a meal, type 2 diabetic subjects had higher circulating endotoxin levels (125.4%↑) than NOC subjects (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These studies have highlighted that exposure to a high-fat meal elevates circulating endotoxin irrespective of metabolic state, as early as 1 h after a meal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, this increase is substantial in IGT and type 2 diabetic subjects, suggesting that metabolic endotoxinemia is exacerbated after high fat intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our data suggest that, in a compromised metabolic state such as type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, a continual snacking routine will cumulatively promote their condition more rapidly than in other individuals because of the greater exposure to endotoxin </plain></SENT>
