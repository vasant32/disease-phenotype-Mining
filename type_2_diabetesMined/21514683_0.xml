<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">Streptozotocin</z:chebi>-induced type-2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM) model was set up in male Sprague Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DM rats were treated with or without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (4 mg/kg/day for 8 weeks) and/or <z:chebi fb="240" ids="27638">cobalt</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> rats were used as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The blood chemistry, urine albumin, kidney histology, and expression of HIF-1α and VEGF of the different groups were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The kidney weights and kidney weight indexes of DM rats were significantly higher than in NC rats (P&lt;0.01) and the kidney weights and kidney weight indexes of rats in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> and/or <z:chebi fb="240" ids="27638">cobalt</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> treatment group were significantly less than in DM group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Relative to rats in the NC group, rats in the DM group had significantly disrupted serum chemistry, urinary albumin, and kidney histology, and significantly enhanced expression of HIF-1a and VEGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rats in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> and/or <z:chebi fb="240" ids="27638">cobalt</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> treatment group experienced significant amelioration of these effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In a rat model, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> ameliorated many of the physiological, cellular, and molecular processes associated with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
