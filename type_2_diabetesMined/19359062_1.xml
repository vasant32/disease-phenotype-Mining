<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the relationship between sports activity and the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among Chinese populations is still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We prospectively investigated the association between sports activity and incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a Chinese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Habitual physical activity in the presumed last year was obtained from a questionnaire developed by Baecke and colleagues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During a median 9.02-year follow-up period among the 1936 participants with complete questionnaire data, 312 participants developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for age, gender and body mass index, the relative risk (RR) of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> according to quartiles of sports activity were 0.86, 0.71 and 0.72 (95% Confidence Interval [CI], 0.52-0.99, P for trend, 0.048) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Participants with the highest quartiles of sports activity had a significantly lower risk than the participants with the lowest quartiles among the <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> group (multivariate RR, 0.61, 95% CI, 0.41-0.92, P for trend=0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the RRs of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were 2.24 (95% CI, 1.58-3.19) for participants who were <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and sedentary, compared with those who were of a healthy weight and participated actively in sports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The findings suggest a significant inverse association between sports activity and incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in middle to older-aged Chinese individuals </plain></SENT>
