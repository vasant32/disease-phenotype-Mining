<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed insulin secretion based on fasting serum C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> level and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> using the short insulin tolerance test (Kitt; rate constant for plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disappearance) in 1601 type 2 diabetic Korean patients (831 men and 770 women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Insulin secretory defects were catergorized as severe (C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>&lt;1.10 ng/ml), moderate (C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> 1.10-1.69 ng/ml), and mild to non-secretory defect (C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>&gt; or=1.70 ng/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Groups with a Kitt value of less than 2.5%/min were considered insulin-resistant, while those with a Kitt value &gt; or =2.5%/min were considered insulin-sensitive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall, 42.5% of patients had a BMI&gt;or =25.0 kg/m(2), and 70.2% had a BMI&gt; or =23.0 kg/m(2); 45.2% (41.7% of men and 58.3% of women) were abdominally <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (waist&gt; or =90 cm in men and 80 cm in women); mean fasting serum C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> level was 1.93+/-0.90 ng/ml, and the mean Kitt value was 2.03+/-0.96%/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, 13, 33, and 54% of patients showed a severe, moderate, and mild to non-secretory defect, respectively; 70.6% were insulin-resistant; and 29.4% were insulin-sensitive </plain></SENT>
