<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Five-week-old OLETF rats were allowed to exercise voluntarily in running wheels for 32 days and the data were compared with those of age-matched non-exercised OLETF and non-diabetic Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka rats (LETO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the soleus muscle, a higher percentage of type I fibres was observed in non-exercised OLETF rats compared with LETO rats, and there were no type IIA fibres in non-exercised OLETF rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the plantaris muscle, a higher percentage of type IIB fibres and a lower percentage of type I and type IIA fibres were observed in non-exercised OLETF rats compared with LETO rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, there were no differences in the fibre-type distribution of soleus and plantaris muscles between exercised OLETF and LETO rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The body weight and type I fibre percentage of the soleus muscle were related to the running distance in exercised OLETF rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>White adipose tissue weight, HbA(1c) and blood insulin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations were lower in exercised OLETF rats than in non-exercised OLETF rats, irrespective of the running distance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a difference in the gene-expression pattern of the soleus muscle among LETO rats, non-exercised OLETF and exercised OLETF rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Running exercise can inhibit <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-associated type shifting of fibres, which is more apparent with postnatal growth, in skeletal muscles of diabetic OLETF rats, as a result of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression change in muscle </plain></SENT>
