<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We designed a controlled study to assess the impact of population management versus usual care on metabolic risk factor testing and management in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also identified potential patient-related barriers to effective <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used novel clinical software to rank 910 patients in a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> registry at a single primary care clinic and thereby identify the 149 patients with the highest HbA(1c) and cholesterol levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After review of the medical records of these 149 patients, evidence-based guideline recommendations regarding metabolic testing and management were sent via e-mail to each intervention patient's primary care provider (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCP</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Over a 3-month follow-up period, we assessed changes in the evidence-based management of intervention patients compared with a matched cohort of control patients receiving usual care at a second primary care clinic affiliated with the same academic medical center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the intervention cohort, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCPs</z:e> followed testing recommendations more often (78%) than therapeutic change recommendations (36%, P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with the usual care control cohort, population management resulted in a greater overall proportion of evidence-based guideline practices being followed (59 vs. 45%, P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most intervention patients (62%) had potential barriers to effective care, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (35%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740858" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">substance abuse</z:e> (26%), and prior nonadherence to care plans (18%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Population management with clinical recommendations sent to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCPs</z:e> had a modest but statistically significant impact on the evidence-based management of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with usual care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740858" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">substance abuse</z:e> are prevalent patient-level adherence barriers in patients with poor metabolic control </plain></SENT>
