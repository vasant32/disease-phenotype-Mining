<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in an online <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-management program, compared with usual-care control subjects, would 1) demonstrate reduced A1C at 6 and 18 months, 2) have fewer symptoms, 3) demonstrate increased exercise, and 4) have improved self-efficacy and patient activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, participants randomized to listserve reinforcement would have better 18-month outcomes than participants receiving no reinforcement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 761 participants were randomized to 1) the program, 2) the program with e-mail reinforcement, or 3) were usual-care control subjects (no treatment) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This sample included 110 American Indians/Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analyses of covariance models were used at the 6- and 18-month follow-up to compare groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At 6 months, A1C, patient activation, and self-efficacy were improved for program participants compared with usual care control subjects (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no changes in other health or behavioral indicators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The AI/AN program participants demonstrated improvements in health distress and activity limitation compared with usual-care control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The subgroup with initial A1C &gt;7% demonstrated stronger improvement in A1C (P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 18 months, self-efficacy and patient activation were improved for program participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A1C was not measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Reinforcement showed no improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: An online <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-management program is acceptable for people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although the results were mixed they suggest 1) that the program may have beneficial effects in reducing A1C, 2) AI/AN populations can be engaged in and benefit from online interventions, and 3) our follow-up reinforcement appeared to have no value </plain></SENT>
