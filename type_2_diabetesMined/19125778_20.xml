<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of alogliptin, a potent and highly selective dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> inadequately controlled by sulphonylurea monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: After a 2-week screening period, adult patients 18-80 years of age entered a 4-week run-in/stabilization period in which they were switched from their own sulphonylurea medication to an equivalent dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi> (open label) plus placebo (single blind) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After the run-in period, patients were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with alogliptin 12.5 mg (n = 203), alogliptin 25 mg (n = 198), or placebo (n = 99) for 26 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary end-point was change from baseline to week 26 in glycosylated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Secondary end-points included clinical response rates and changes in fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, beta-cell function (fasting proinsulin, insulin, proinsulin/insulin ratio, and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, and homeostasis model assessment beta-cell function), body weight, and safety end-points [adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory tests, vital signs and electrocardiographic readings] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study population had a mean age of 57 years and a mean disease duration of 8 years; it was well balanced for gender (52% women) and was mainly white (71%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean baseline HbA1c was approximately 8.1% in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significantly greater least squares (LS) mean reductions in HbA1c were seen at week 26 with alogliptin 12.5 mg (-0.38%) and 25 mg (-0.52%) vs. placebo (+0.01%; p &lt; 0.001), and more patients in the alogliptin 25-mg group had HbA1c levels &lt; or =7.0% at week 26 (34.8%, p = 0.002) vs. placebo (18.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Proportionately more patients in the alogliptin 12.5 mg (47.3%) and 25 mg (50.5%) groups had an HbA1c reduction &gt; or =0.5% from baseline compared with patients in the placebo group (26.3%; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Minor improvements in individual markers of beta-cell function were seen with alogliptin, but no significant treatment group differences were noted relative to placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Minor LS mean changes in body weight were noted across groups (placebo, -0.20 kg; alogliptin 12.5 mg, +0.60 kg; alogliptin 25 mg, +0.68 kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>AEs were reported for 63-64% of patients receiving alogliptin and 54% of patients receiving placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Few AEs were treatment limiting (2.0-2.5% across groups), and serious AEs (2.0-5.6%) were infrequent, similar across groups, and generally considered not related to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The incidences of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> for placebo, alogliptin 12.5 mg and alogliptin 25 mg groups were 11.1, 15.8 and 9.6% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> inadequately controlled by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi> monotherapy, the addition of alogliptin resulted in clinically significant reductions in HbA1c without increased incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
