<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2D) susceptibility have been identified in predominantly European-derived populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These SNPs have not been extensively investigated for individual and cumulative effects on T2D risk in African Americans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Seventeen index T2D risk variants were genotyped in 2,652 African American case subjects with T2D and 1,393 nondiabetic control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Individual SNPs and cumulative risk allele loads were assessed for association with risk for T2D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cumulative risk was assessed by counting risk alleles and evaluating the difference in cumulative risk scores between case subjects and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A second analysis weighted risk scores (ln [OR]) based on previously reported European-derived effect sizes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Frequencies of risk alleles ranged from 8.6 to 99.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eleven SNPs had ORs &gt;1, and 5 from ADAMTS9, WFS1, CDKAL1, JAZF1, and TCF7L2 trended or had nominally significant evidence of T2D association (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Individuals carried between 13 and 29 risk alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Association was observed between T2D and increase in risk allele load (unweighted OR 1.04 [95% CI 1.01-1.08], P = 0.010; weighted 1.06 [1.03-1.10], P = 8.10 Ã— 10(-5)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When TCF7L2 SNP rs7903146 was included as a covariate, the risk score was no longer associated with T2D in either model (unweighted 1.02 [0.98-1.05], P = 0.33; weighted 1.02 [0.98-1.06], P = 0.40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The trend of increase in risk for T2D with increasing risk allele load is similar to observations in European-derived populations; however, these analyses indicate that T2D genetic risk is primarily mediated through the effect of TCF7L2 in African Americans </plain></SENT>
