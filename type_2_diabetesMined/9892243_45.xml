<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is produced primarily from <z:chebi fb="1" ids="27137">triose</z:chebi> phosphates and is detoxified to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16004">D-lactate</z:chebi> (DL) by the glyoxalase pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because guanidino compounds can block dicarbonyl groups, we have investigated the effects of the diamino <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3095">biguanide</z:chebi> compound <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> on MG and its detoxification products in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MG and DL were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography in plasma from 57 subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these subjects, 27 were treated with diet, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi>, or insulin (nonmetformin), and 30 were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>; 28 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects were also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Glycemic control was determined by HbA1c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MG was significantly elevated in diabetic subjects versus the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects (189.3 +/- 38.7 vs. 123.0 +/- 37 nmol/l, P = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MG levels were significantly reduced by high-dosage (1,500-2,500 mg/day) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (158.4 +/- 44.2 nmol/l) compared with nonmetformin (189.3 +/- 38.7 nmol/l, P = 0.03) or low-dosage (&lt; or = 1,000 mg/day) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (210.98 +/- 51.0 nmol/l, P = 0.001), even though the groups had similar glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conversely, DL levels were significantly elevated in both the low- and high-dosage <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> groups relative to the nonmetformin group (13.8 +/- 7.7 and 13.4 +/- 4.6 vs. 10.4 +/- 3.9 micromol/l, P = 0.03 and 0.06, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MG correlated with rising HbA1c levels (R = 0.4, P = 0.03, slope = 13.2) in the nonmetformin subjects but showed no increase with worsening glycemic control in the high-dosage <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> group (R = 0.0004, P = 0.99, slope = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, MG is elevated in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and relates to glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> reduces MG in a dose-dependent fashion and minimizes the effect of worsening glycemic control on MG levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>To the extent that elevated MG levels lead to their development, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> treatment may protect against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> by mechanisms independent of its antihyperglycemic effect </plain></SENT>
