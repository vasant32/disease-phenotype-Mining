<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Participants were randomly assigned to placebo (n = 1,082), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (850 mg twice a day) (n = 1,073), or intensive lifestyle intervention (n = 1,079) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> hazard rate was negatively associated with baseline insulin sensitivity (hazard rate ratio = 0.62-0.94 per SD difference, depending on treatment group and measure of sensitivity) and with baseline insulin secretion (hazard rate ratio = 0.57-0.76 per SD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Improvements in insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity were associated with lower hazard rates in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treatment arms (hazard rate ratio = 0.46-0.95 per SD increase and 0.29-0.79 per SD increase, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In multivariate models that included the three metabolic variables (changes in body weight, insulin sensitivity, and insulin secretion) each significantly and independently predicted progression to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> when adjusted for the other two variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The intensive lifestyle intervention, which elicited the greatest reduction in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence, produced the greatest improvement in insulin sensitivity and the best preservation of beta-cell function after 1 year, whereas the placebo group, which had the highest <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence, had no significant change in insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function after 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> group, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk, insulin sensitivity, and beta-cell function at 1 year were intermediate between those in the intensive lifestyle and placebo groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, higher insulin secretion and sensitivity at baseline and improvements in response to treatment were associated with lower <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk in the DPP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The better preventive effectiveness of intensive lifestyle may be due to improved insulin sensitivity concomitant with preservation of beta-cell function </plain></SENT>
