<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Understanding the responsible mechanisms may contribute to our knowledge of the pathophysiology of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and help identify new drug targets or improve surgical techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This review summarises the present knowledge based on pathophysiological studies published during the last decade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Taken together, two main mechanisms seem to be responsible for the early improvement in glycaemic control after RYGB: (1) an increase in hepatic insulin sensitivity induced, at least in part, by energy restriction and (2) improved beta cell function associated with an exaggerated postprandial glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> 1 secretion owing to the altered transit of nutrients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Later a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> induced improvement in peripheral insulin sensitivity follows </plain></SENT>
