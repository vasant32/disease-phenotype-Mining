<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study time course changes in knowledge, problem solving ability, and quality of life in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> managed by group compared with individual care and education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a 5-year randomized controlled clinical trial of continuing systemic education delivered by group versus individual <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care in a hospital-based secondary care <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 120 patients with non-insulin-treated type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> enrolled and randomly allocated to group or individual care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight did not start and 28 did not complete the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The main outcome measures were knowledge of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, problem solving ability, quality of life, HbA1c, BMI, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Knowledge of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and problem solving ability improved from year 1 with group care and worsened among control subjects (P&lt;0.001 for both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Quality of life improved from year 2 with group care but worsened with individual care (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HbA1c level progressively increased over 5 years among control subjects (+1.7%, 95% CI 1.1-2.2) but not group care patients (+0.1%, -0.5 to 0.4), in whom BMI decreased (-1.4, -2.0 to -0.7) and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> increased (+0.14 mmol/l, 0.07-0.22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> can acquire specific knowledge and conscious behaviors if exposed to educational procedures and settings tailored to their needs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Traditional one-to-one care, although delivered according to optimized criteria, is associated with progressive deterioration of knowledge, problem solving ability, and quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Better cognitive and psychosocial results are associated with more favorable clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
