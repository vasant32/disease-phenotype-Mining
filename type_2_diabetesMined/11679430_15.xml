<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The newly inbred Cohen diabetic rat is an exceptional experimental model of diet-induced type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> that is the result of secondary inbreeding nearly 30 years after it originally had been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Animals from the original colony were selectively inbred by stringent criteria for 10 additional generations, bringing overall inbreeding to &gt;50 generations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The metabolic phenotypes of the resulting contrasting strains, designated as the Cohen diabetic-sensitive (CDs) and -resistant (CDr) rats, were characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The phenotype of the CDs strain that was fed a regular diet consisted of fasting normoglycemia, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance to intraperitoneal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> loading, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fasting insulin levels, and a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> insulin response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> loading </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, CDs rats that were fed a custom-prepared high-<z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> low-copper diabetogenic diet became overtly diabetic: fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or elevated, and the blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> insulin response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> loading was markedly abnormal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CDr rats that were fed a regular or diabetogenic diet did not develop <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and maintained <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance and insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A striking sex difference was observed in CDs rats that were fed a diabetogenic diet: males had a lower growth rate and a more severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> pattern than females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Gonadectomy shortly after weaning did not prevent the development of the diabetic phenotype in its early phase in either sex but markedly attenuated its expression in males at a later phase, abolishing the sex differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Alternate-day feeding, as opposed to daily feeding, also attenuated the metabolic phenotype in males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The development of the diabetic phenotype in CDs rats that were fed a diabetogenic diet was not accompanied by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The genetic profile of the strains was established using 550 microsatellite markers evenly distributed throughout the rat genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The rate of homozygosity within strain was &gt; or = 96% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The rate of polymorphism between the contrasting strains was 43% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the metabolic phenotypes of the rebred colony of CDs and CDr rats and their genetic makeup render the Cohen diabetic rat a useful experimental model that is highly suitable for studying the interaction between nutritional-metabolic environmental factors and genetic susceptibility (sensitivity and resistance) for the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The model is also distinctively useful for investigating the effect of sex on the expression of the diabetic phenotype </plain></SENT>
