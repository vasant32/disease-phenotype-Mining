<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesise that this vasoconstrictor may prevent full perfusion of muscle, thereby limiting delivery of insulin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and contributing to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> effects of endothelin-1 on insulin-mediated haemodynamic and metabolic effects were examined in rats in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Endothelin-1 (50 pmol min(-1) kg(-1) for 2.5 h) was infused alone, or 30 min prior to a hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic insulin clamp (10 mU min(-1) kg(-1) for 2 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Insulin clamps (10 or 15 mU min(-1) kg(-1)) were performed after 30 min of saline infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Endothelin-1 infusion alone increased plasma endothelin-1 11-fold (p &lt; 0.05) and blood pressure by 20% (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Endothelin-1 alone had no effect on femoral blood flow, capillary recruitment or <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake, but endothelin-1 with 10 mU min(-1) kg(-1) insulin caused a decrease in insulin clearance from 0.35 +/- 0.6 to 0.19 +/- 0.02 ml/min (p = 0.02), resulting in significantly higher plasma insulin levels (10 mU min(-1) kg(-1) insulin: 2,120 +/- 190 pmol/l; endothelin-1 + 10 mU min(-1)kg(-1) insulin: 4,740 +/- 910 pmol/l), equivalent to 15 mU min(-1) kg(-1) insulin alone (4,920 +/- 190 pmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The stimulatory effects of equivalent doses of insulin on femoral blood flow, capillary recruitment and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake were blocked by endothelin-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Endothelin-1 blocks insulin's haemodynamic effects, particularly capillary recruitment, and is associated with decreased muscle <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that elevated endothelin-1 levels may contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> of muscle by increasing vascular resistance and limiting insulin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> delivery </plain></SENT>
