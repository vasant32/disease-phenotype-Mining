<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we report the effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GKA treatment on the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> and beta cell loss in the male <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> diabetic fatty (ZDF) rat, a model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cell protection by GKA was studied in MIN6 and INS-1 cells exposed to <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis and beta cell mass were evaluated in ZDF rats dosed for 41 days with Cpd-C (a GKA) or glipizide (a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi>) as food admixtures at doses of approximately 3 and 10 mg kg(-1) day(-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Incubation of MIN6 and INS-1 832/3 insulinoma cell cultures with GKA significantly reduced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and impairment of intracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi> production caused by exposure to <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Progression from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetes</z:e> (normoglycaemia and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020459" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperinsulinaemia</z:e>) to overt <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> and hypoinsulinaemia) was significantly delayed in male ZDF rats by in-feed treatment with Cpd-C, but not glipizide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, tested in the fifth week of treatment, was also significantly improved by Cpd-C, as was pancreatic insulin content and beta cell area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a limited immunohistochemical analysis, Cpd-C modestly and significantly enhanced the rate of beta cell proliferation, but not rates of beta cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> relative to untreated ZDF rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These findings suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> activation of glucokinase preserves beta cell mass and delays disease in the ZDF rat, a model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and progressive beta cell failure </plain></SENT>
