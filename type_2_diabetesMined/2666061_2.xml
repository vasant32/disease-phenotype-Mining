<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>According to the modern pathophysiological understanding of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the mechanisms of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> action, combined insulin-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> therapy appears to be an interesting alternative for treating diabetic patients with secondary failure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From its revival in the early 1980s, combination therapy has been shown to have a positive effect on blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control although initially published clinical studies, generally open and uncontrolled, have been widely criticized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several recent well-designed studies confirmed these favorable results, with better <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> profiles and/or decreased insulin needs, which were shown to persist after 1 year or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most of the studies investigating the mechanism of action indicate that the effect is mainly due to stimulation of the residual insulin secretion with minimal or no effect on insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001988'>hypoglycemic episodes</z:hpo> is rather small when insulin doses are adapted at the beginning of the combined therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Effects on <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism are minimal and controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, insulin-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> treatment may be a safe and effective solution in type 2 diabetic patients with secondary failure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi>, particularly in those with significant residual endogenous insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The additional cost of such combined therapy should be weighed against the potential advantages of better metabolic control </plain></SENT>
