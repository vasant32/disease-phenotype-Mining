<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001735'>acute pancreatitis</z:hpo> have been reported in association with exenatide, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi>, and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> without use of these medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It remains unknown whether exenatide or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> increase the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001735'>acute pancreatitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of a large medical and pharmacy claims database was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data for 786,656 patients were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazard models were built to compare the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001735'>acute pancreatitis</z:hpo> between diabetic and nondiabetic subjects and between exenatide, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi>, and control <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> medication use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001735'>acute pancreatitis</z:hpo> in the nondiabetic control group, diabetic control group, exenatide group, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> group was 1.9, 5.6, 5.7, and 5.6 cases per 1,000 patient years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001735'>acute pancreatitis</z:hpo> was significantly higher in the combined diabetic groups than in the nondiabetic control group (adjusted hazard ratio 2.1 [95% CI 1.7-2.5]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001735'>acute pancreatitis</z:hpo> was similar in the exenatide versus diabetic control group (0.9 [0.6-1.5]) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> versus diabetic control group (1.0 [0.7-1.3]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated increased incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001735'>acute pancreatitis</z:hpo> in diabetic versus nondiabetic patients but did not find an association between the use of exenatide or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001735'>acute pancreatitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The limitations of this observational claims-based analysis cannot exclude the possibility of an increased risk </plain></SENT>
