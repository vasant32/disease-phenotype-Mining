<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the mechanisms of action, therapeutic potential, and challenges inherent in the use of incretin <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> and dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) inhibitors for the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The scientific literature describing the biological importance of incretin <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> and DPP-IV inhibitors in the control of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis has been reviewed, with an emphasis on mechanisms of action, experimental <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, human physiological experiments, and short-term clinical studies in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and diabetic human subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> 1 (GLP-1) and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent insulinotropic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (GIP) exert important effects on beta-cells to stimulate <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> also regulate beta-cell proliferation and cytoprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>GLP-1, but not GIP, inhibits gastric emptying, glucagon secretion, and food intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering actions of GLP-1, but not GIP, are preserved in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, native GLP-1 is rapidly degraded by DPP-IV after parenteral administration; hence, degradation-resistant, long-acting GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> are preferable agents for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> treatment of human <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, inhibition of DPP-IV-mediated incretin degradation represents a complementary therapeutic approach, as orally available DPP-IV inhibitors have been shown to lower <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in experimental diabetic models and human subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: GLP-1R <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> and DPP-IV inhibitors have shown promising results in clinical trials for the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The need for daily injections of potentially immunogenic GLP-1-derived <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> and the potential for unanticipated side effects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> use of DPP-IV inhibitors will require ongoing scrutiny of the risk-benefit ratio for these new therapies as they are evaluated in the clinic </plain></SENT>
