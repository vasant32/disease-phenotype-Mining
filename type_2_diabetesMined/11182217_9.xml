<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous studies investigating the relationship between insulin therapy on quality of life (QOL) in Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have produced conflicting results that may reflect differences in patient samples, study design and context </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To assess the effect of insulin on QOL in a community-based, prospective and observational setting, we studied 1290 Type 2 patients recruited from a region of 120,097 people and undergoing detailed annual assessments of metabolic control and complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The average age of the cohort was 64.1 years, the median duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 4.4 years and 48.9% were males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A modified <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Quality of Life (DQOL) questionnaire and a health measurement questionnaire providing the Rosser index were administered annually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At baseline, the 149 insulin-treated patients had greater satisfaction, worry, impact and total DQOL scores (indicating a worse QOL) than the 1141 non-insulin-treated patients (P&lt; or =0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Except in the case of satisfaction, these differences persisted after adjustment for potentially confounding demographic, socioeconomic and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-specific variables (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Rosser index showed a similar pattern, with insulin-treated patients having lower values both before (P=0.012) and after (P&lt;0.001) adjustment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, 38 patients commenced insulin but there were no significant differences in DQOL scores or the Rosser index either side of this therapeutic change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 389 patients on stable therapy and followed for 4 years, DQOL remained significantly higher in insulin-treated patients (P&lt; or =0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that, although positive factors including increased support and improved hyperglycaemic symptoms may initially offset unfavourable aspects of insulin self-administration, their effect wanes and a lower QOL supervenes after 1-2 years </plain></SENT>
