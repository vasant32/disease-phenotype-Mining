<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the association between alpha-adducin 1 (ADD1) gene polymorphism (Gly460Trp) with macrovascular complications and mortality in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a Caucasian population aged &gt;or=55 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study was part of the Rotterdam Study, a prospective population-based cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ADD1 polymorphism was determined in 6,471 participants, including 599 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in type 2 diabetic patients was 2.57 times higher in ADD1 TT carriers compared with GG carriers (95% CI 1.05-6.32, P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Homozygous T carriers also had a higher mean common carotid intima media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) compared with GG carriers (mean difference 0.05 mm, P for trend = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In diabetic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, the risk of mortality was 1.83 times higher in homozygous T carriers compared with the GG genotype group (95% CI 1.07-3.16, P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The increased risk was only present among TT carriers who did not use antidiabetes medication (hazard ratio 2.18 [95% CI 1.12-4.24], P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results of this population-based cohort study suggest that the ADD1 gene contributes to the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and increases mean common carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the study indicates that the ADD1 polymorphism could be useful in identifying hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients with a high risk of mortality </plain></SENT>
