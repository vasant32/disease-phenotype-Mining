<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the extent to which type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is associated with poorer performance on measures of learning, memory, psychomotor speed, and problem-solving in middle-aged adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study evaluated 50 adults (age range 34-65 years, mean 50.8) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 50 demographically similar community control subjects without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each subject received a thorough physical examination and a detailed neuropsychological assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Factor analysis was used to assign specific tests to 1 of 4 cognitive domains (learning, memory for stories, problem-solving, and psychomotor speed) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hierarchical regression analysis was used to identify demographic and biomedical variables associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Learning, memory, and problem-solving skills were unaffected by type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, psychomotor slowing was predicted by a diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (r2 change = 0.075, P &lt; 0.002) with additional variance in psychomotor efficiency explained independently by HbA1 (r2 = 0.064, P &lt; 0.003) and vibratory threshold (r2 = 0.112, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of psychomotor slowing on specific tests ranged from 12% (Digit Vigilance) to 23% (Grooved Pegboard) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Middle-aged adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> manifest psychomotor slowing that is associated with poorer metabolic control, whereas learning, memory, and problem-solving skills appear to be largely intact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The development of psychomotor slowing may be a manifestation of a "central <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e>" induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
