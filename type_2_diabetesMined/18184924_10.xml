<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Variants in the ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1) gene have shown positive associations with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and related phenotypes, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e>, and type 1 diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Additionally, evidence for linkage for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in African Americans was observed at 6q24-27, with the proximal edge of the peak encompassing the ENPP1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to comprehensively evaluate variants in ENPP1 for association with type 2 diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Forty-nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in the coding and flanking regions of ENPP1 were genotyped in 577 African-American individuals with type 2 diabetic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e> and 596 African-American control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Haplotypic association and genotypic association for the dominant, additive, and recessive models were tested by calculating a chi(2) statistic and corresponding P value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine SNPs showed nominal evidence for association (P &lt; 0.05) with type 2 diabetic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e> in one or more genotypic model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most significant associations were observed with rs7754586 (P = 0.003 dominant model, P = 0.0005 additive, and P = 0.007 recessive), located in the 3' untranslated region, and an intron 24 SNP (rs1974201: P = 0.004 dominant, P = 0.0005 additive, and P = 0.005 recessive) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the extensively studied K121Q variant (rs1044498) did not reveal evidence for association with type 2 diabetic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e> in this African-American population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study was the first to comprehensively evaluate variants of the ENPP1 gene for association in an African-American population with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e> and suggests that variants in the distal region of the ENPP1 gene may contribute to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> susceptibility in African Americans </plain></SENT>
