<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (IR) and insulin secretion (IS) on the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> in individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) who underwent lifestyle interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 284 out of 577 individuals with IGT identified by population-based screening in Da Qing, China, who were randomized to undergo diet change and/or increased physical activity had baseline fasting and 2 h post-load insulin determinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were followed for 6 years for the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IR and IS were assessed using calculated indices based on fasting plasma insulin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The interactions of IR, IS, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and the effects of the lifestyle interventions were evaluated using Cox Proportional Hazards analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both IR and IS were significantly associated with the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lifestyle interventions were more effective in those with lower IT and higher IS at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Diet plus exercise interventions resulted in significantly lower incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, even after controlling for IR, IS, BMI and 2hrPG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Both IR and beta-cell function were predictors of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Chinese with IGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Lifestyle intervention reduced the incidence of DM and these interventions were more effective in those with less IR </plain></SENT>
