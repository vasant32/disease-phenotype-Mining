<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We evaluated whether psychosocial factors that are related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> predict prospectively the risk for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> using the different clinical criteria available for defining the syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Women were enrolled in a population-based prospective cohort study called the Healthy Women Study and were followed for an average of 15 years after baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Metabolic syndrome</z:e> was defined via the World Health Organization, the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III, and the International <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Foundation clinical criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among women who did not have the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> at the baseline, the risk for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> defined in multiple ways varied from 1.21- to 2.12-fold ([95% CI 1.00-4.25], P &lt; 0.05) for more severe depressive symptoms or very stressful life event(s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These associations were largely the same, regardless of the clinical criteria used to define the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Those who at the baseline reported feeling frequently and intensely angry, tense, or stressed also had an increased risk for developing the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> at least by one definition (relative risk 1.19-1.66 [1.00-2.39]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These are the first data to demonstrate that psychosocial factors predict the risk for developing the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> by multiple definitions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Psychosocial factors may play a causal role in the chain of events leading to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
