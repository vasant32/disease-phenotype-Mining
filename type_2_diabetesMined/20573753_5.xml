<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE) is a significant determinant of overall metabolic control as well as increased risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Older individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are more likely to have moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> and structural changes in brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Considering that poor metabolic control is considered a deranging factor for cognitive performance in diabetic patients, we evaluated whether the contributions of MAGE to cognitive status in older patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were independent from the main markers of glycemic control, such as sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> (A1C), postprandial glycemia (<z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi>), and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In 121 older patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 48-h continuous subcutaneous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring (CSGM) were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAGE and <z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi> were evaluated during CSGM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relationship of MAGE to performance on cognitive tests was assessed, with adjustment for age, glycemic control markers, and other determinants of cognitive status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cognitive tests were a composite score of executive and attention functioning and the Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MAGE was significantly correlated with MMSE (r = 0.83; P &lt; 0.001) and with cognition composite score (r = 0.68; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, MAGE was associated with the MMSE (P &lt; 0.001) and cognition composite score (P &lt; 0.001) independently of age, sex, BMI, waist-to-hip (WHR) ratio, drug intake, physical activity, mean arterial blood pressure, FPG, <z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi>, and A1C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MAGE during a daily period was associated with an impairment of cognitive functioning independent of A1C, FPG, and <z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The present data suggest that interventional trials in older patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> should target not only A1C, <z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi>, and FPG but also daily <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> swings </plain></SENT>
