<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since an herbal compound, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16118">berberine</z:chebi>, lowers blood levels of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, we proposed that it would improve insulin/IGF-1 signaling, blocking muscle protein losses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We evaluated whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16118">berberine</z:chebi> ameliorates <z:hpo ids='HP_0003202'>muscle atrophy</z:hpo> in db/db mice, a model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, by measuring protein synthesis and degradation in muscles of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and db/db mice treated with or without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16118">berberine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also examined mechanisms for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16118">berberine</z:chebi>-induced changes in muscle protein metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16118">Berberine</z:chebi> administration decreased protein synthesis and increased degradation in muscles of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and db/db mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The protein catabolic mechanism depended on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16118">berberine</z:chebi>-stimulated expression of the E3 ubiquitin ligase, atrogin-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Atrogin-1 not only increased proteolysis but also reduced protein synthesis by mechanisms that were independent of decreased phosphorylation of Akt or forkhead transcription factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Impaired protein synthesis was dependent on a reduction in eIF3-f, an essential regulator of protein synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16118">Berberine</z:chebi> impaired energy metabolism, activating <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase and providing an alternative mechanism for the stimulation of atrogin-1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When we increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> biogenesis by expressing peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16118">berberine</z:chebi>-induced changes in muscle protein metabolism were prevented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16118">Berberine</z:chebi> impairs muscle metabolism by two novel mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It impairs mitochonidrial function stimulating the expression of atrogin-1 without affecting phosphorylation of forkhead transcription factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The increase in atrogin-1 not only stimulated protein degradation but also suppressed protein synthesis, causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0003202'>muscle atrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
