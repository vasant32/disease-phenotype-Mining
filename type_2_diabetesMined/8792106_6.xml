<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Diabetic patients often suffer from symptoms arising from the gastrointestinal tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several factors are considered responsible for these alterations, including abnormalities of gastric motility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently Helicobacter pylori (HP) has been identified in a relevant aliquot of subjects with or without gastrointestinal abnormalities, but only scarce and controversial data are available on the prevalence of HP and the association between HP and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005231'>chronic gastritis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004398'>peptic ulcer</z:hpo> in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, the possible association between alterations of gastric motility induced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0259749" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autonomic neuropathy</z:e> (AN) and the presence of HP has never been evaluated in diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study we document the presence of HP in the gastric biopsies of 73% out of a series of 29 patients affected by type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and non-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyspepsia</z:e> (3 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oesophagitis</z:e>, 10 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo>, 7 with bulbar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013298" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">duodenitis</z:e>, and 9 with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> endoscopy), with a significantly higher prevalence (P &lt; 0.01) in subjects with AN (74%) than in subjects without AN (26%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two other tests have been compared with the histological evidence of HP (used as golden standard), i.e. the urease test (CP-test) and the assay of anti-HP G-immunoglobulins, both of which were positive in a significantly (P &lt; 0.01) higher percentage of neuropathic patients in comparison with non-neuropathic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and the specificity of the CP-test were 96% and 100%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similarly, both the sensitivity and the specificity of the assay of IgG HP-Ab were 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Since patients affected by non-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyspepsia</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002057'>NIDDM</z:mp> complicated by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0259749" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autonomic neuropathy</z:e> are under a higher risk to be carriers of HP than non-neuropathic or non-diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The assay of serum IgG HP-Ab could be used as a screening method, thus avoiding the more expensive and time-consuming endoscopy </plain></SENT>
