<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The reason for the hyperglucagonaemia is unclear, but recent studies have shown lack of suppression after oral but preserved suppression after isoglycaemic intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, pointing to factors from the gut </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Gastrointestinal hormones that are secreted in response to oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> include glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) that strongly inhibits glucagon secretion, and GLP-2 and GIP, both of which stimulate secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When the three hormones are given together on top of isoglycaemic intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, glucagon suppression is delayed in a manner similar to that observed after oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Studies with the GLP-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, exendin 9-39, suggest that endogenous GLP-1 plays an important role in regulation of glucagon secretion during fasting as well as postprandially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms whereby GLP-1 regulates glucagon secretion are debated, but studies in isolated perfused rat pancreas point to an important role for a paracrine regulation by somatostatin from neighbouring D cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical studies of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> effect of GLP-1 in T2DM suggest that the inhibition of glucagon secretion is as important as the stimulation of insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
