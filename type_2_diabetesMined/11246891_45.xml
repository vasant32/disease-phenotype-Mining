<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A total of 896 individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent were ascertained in Israel from 267 multiplex families, including 472 sib-pairs affected with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A genome-wide scan with average marker spacing of 9.5 cM revealed five regions on four chromosomes (4q, 8q, 14q, and 20q) that exhibited nominal evidence for linkage (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The highest observed nonparametric linkage Z score was 2.41 (equivalent to a logarithm of odds score of 1.26) at marker D4S1501 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A maximal signal, with a Z score of 2.05, was observed on chromosome 20 near marker D20S195, and another on 20p near marker D20S103 (Z 1.80) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A single marker on chromosome 8 (D8S593) and two adjacent markers on chromosome 14 (D14S749 and D14S605) also attained evidence of linkage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To explore the hypothesis that the signals on chromosomes 4 and 20 are differentially attributable to variation in BMI or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo>, an ordered subset analysis was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This analysis revealed that only when the families were ranked by BMI (in increasing order) did a subset attain nominal significance, and only for chromosome 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The findings reported here lend credence to the hypothesis, now supported by four studies of Caucasian populations and most recently by a combined analysis of 1,852 pedigrees, that a type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility locus resides on chromosome 20q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This population, because of its unique genetic attributes, may facilitate identification of this and other genes contributing to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
