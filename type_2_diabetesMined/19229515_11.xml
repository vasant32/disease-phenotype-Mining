<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten morbidly <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> participants, five with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (NGT) and five with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, were studied before and within 2 weeks after BPD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Within-day variations in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent insulinotropic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (GIP) and glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> 1 (GLP1) levels were assessed using a single cosinor model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity was assessed by euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Basal GLP1 relative amplitude (amplitude/mesor x 100) was 25.82-4.06% in NGT; it increased to 41.38-4.32% after BPD but was unchanged in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>GLP1 and GIP mesor were shifted in time after surgery in diabetic patients but not in NGT participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After BPD, the GLP1 AUC significantly increased from 775 +/- 94 to 846 +/- 161 pmol l(-1) min in NGT, whereas GIP AUC decreased significantly from 1,373 +/- 565 to 513 +/- 186 pmol l(-1) min in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two-way ANOVA showed a strong influence of BPD on both GIP (p = 0.010) and GLP1 AUCs (p = 0.033), which was potentiated by the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, particularly for GIP (BPD x <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity was markedly improved (p &lt; 0.01) in NGT (from 9.14 +/- 3.63 to 36.04 +/- 8.55 micromol [kg fat-free mass](-1) min(-1)) and diabetic patients (from 9.49 +/- 3.56 to 38.57 +/- 4.62 micromol [kg fat-free mass](-1) min(-1)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: An incretin circadian rhythm was shown for the first time in morbid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The effect of BPD on the 24 h pattern of incretin differed between NGT and diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>GLP1 secretion impairment was reversed in NGT and could not be overcome by surgery in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, GIP secretion was blunted after the operation only in diabetic patients, suggesting a role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
