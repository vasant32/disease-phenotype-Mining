<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) can bypass these insulin-secretory defects in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but the mechanism of exocytotic events mediated by GLP-1 in rescuing insulin secretion is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) technique was used to examine single insulin granule fusion events in mouse islet beta cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no difference in the density of docked granules in the resting state between Munc13-1(+/+) and Munc13-1(+/-) mouse islet beta cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While exocytosis of previously docked granules in Munc13-1(+/-) beta cells is reduced during high-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> stimulation as expected, we now find a reduction in additional exocytosis events that account for the major portion of GSIS, namely two types of newcomer granules, one which has a short docking time (short-dock) and another undergoing no docking before exocytosis (no-dock) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As mammalian homologue of Caenorhabditis elegans unc-13-1 (Munc13-1) is a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">phorbol ester</z:chebi> substrate, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">phorbol ester</z:chebi> could partially rescue biphasic GSIS in Munc13-1-deficient beta cells by enhancing recruitment of short-dock newcomer granules for exocytosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The more effective rescue of biphasic GSIS by GLP-1 than by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">phorbol</z:chebi> was due to increased recruitment of both short-dock and no-dock newcomer granules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">Phorbol ester</z:chebi> and GLP-1 potentiation of biphasic GSIS are brought about by recruitment of distinct populations of newcomer granules for exocytosis, which may be mediated by Munc13-1 interaction with syntaxin-SNARE complexes other than that formed by syntaxin-1A </plain></SENT>
