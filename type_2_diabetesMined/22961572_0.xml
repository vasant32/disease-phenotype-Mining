<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Association between white blood cell (WBC) count and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk has been recently suggested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed whether WBC count is an independent risk factor for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence among young healthy adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: WBC count was measured in 24,897 young (mean age 30.8 Â± 5.36 years), normoglycemic men with WBC range of 3,000 to 12,000 cells/mm(3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Participants were periodically screened for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during a mean follow-up of 7.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During 185,354 person-years of follow-up, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was diagnosed in 447 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A multivariate model adjusted for age, BMI, family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, physical activity, and fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels revealed a 7.6% increase in incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for every increment of 1,000 cells/mm(3) (P = 0.046) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When grouped in quintiles, a baseline WBC count above 6,900 cells/mm(3) had an independent 52% increase in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk (hazard ratio 1.52 [95% CI 1.06-2.18]) compared with the lowest quintile (WBC &lt;5,400 cells/mm(3)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Men at the lowest WBC quintile were protected from <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence even in the presence of overweight, family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, or <z:mp ids='MP_0005317'>elevated triglyceride levels</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After simultaneous control for risk factors, BMI was the primary contributor of the variation in multivariate models (P &lt; 0.001), followed by age and WBC count (P &lt; 0.001), and family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels (P = 0.12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: WBC count, a commonly used and widely available test, is an independent risk factor for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in young men at values well within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
