<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This polymorphism is also repeatedly associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and has been studied in relation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> with divergent results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only a few association studies have investigated whether this polymorphism is related to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We estimated the impact of the GNB3 825C&gt;T polymorphism in relatively large-scale association studies of common phenotypes of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The GNB3 825C&gt;T polymorphism was genotyped in 7,518 white Danish subjects using mass spectrometry analysis of PCR products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Case-control studies were undertaken for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e>, and a meta-analysis including data from the present study and previous studies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Quantitative trait studies of metabolic variables were carried out in 4,387 glucose-tolerant subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We observed minor differences in 825C&gt;T genotype distributions for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (CC/CT/TT 49/41/10% (control) vs 46/46/9% (cases), respectively, p=0.007); however, after correction for multiple testing, these were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No association was found with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> or the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Curiously, the T allele was associated with nominally lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels-a finding in contrast with most previous studies-but not with other metabolic variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Meta-analysis demonstrated a high degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> between study populations of different ethnic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although there was a tendency towards an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> among 825T allele carriers, this was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The present study suggests no major involvement of the GNB3 825C&gt;T polymorphism in components of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
