<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Six African-American FDRs with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance and 12 matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects (who had no family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) were exposed to 48 h of hyperglycemic clamping (approximately 12 mmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Insulin secretion rates (ISRs) were determined by deconvolution of plasma C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels using individual C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> kinetic parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Detrending and smoothing of data (z-scores) and computation of autocorrelation functions were used to identify ISR cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the initial hours after start of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusions, ISRs were approximately 60% higher in FDRs than in control subjects (585 vs. 366 nmol/16 h, P &lt; 0.05), while rates of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake were the same (5.6 mmol x kg(-1) x h(-1)), indicating that the FDRs were insulin resistant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Control subjects had well-defined circadian (24 h) cycles of ISR and plasma insulin that rose in the early morning, peaked in the afternoon, and declined during the night </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, FDRs had several shorter ISR cycles of smaller amplitude that lacked true periodicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This suggested that the lack of a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> circadian ISR increase had made it impossible for the FDRs to maintain their compensatory insulin hypersecretion beyond 18 h of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As a result, ISR decreased to the level found in control subjects, and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake fell below the level of control subjects (61 vs. 117 micromol x kg(-1) x min(-1), P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In summary, we found that FDRs with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance had defects in insulin action and secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The newly recognized insulin secretory defect consisted of disruption of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> circadian ISR cycle, which resulted in <z:mp ids='MP_0003059'>reduced insulin secretion</z:mp> (and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake) during the ascending part of the 24 h ISR cycle </plain></SENT>
