<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is a complex disease involving both genetic and environmental components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities in insulin secretion and insulin action usually precede the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and can serve as good quantitative measures for genetic mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore undertook an autosomal genomic search to locate the quantitative trait locus (QTL) linked to these traits in 1,365 nondiabetic Chinese subjects from 411 nuclear families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Residuals of these log-transformed quantitative traits were analyzed in multipoint linkage analysis using a variance-components approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most significant QTL for fasting insulin, which coincides with the QTL for homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, was located at 37 cM on chromosome 20, with a maximum empirical logarithm of odds (LOD) score of 3.01 (empirical P = 0.00006) when adjusted for age, sex, BMI, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> medications, recruitment centers, and environmental factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the same region, a QTL for fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was identified at 51 cM, with an empirical LOD score of 2.03 (empirical P = 0.0012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were other loci with maximum empirical LOD scores &gt;or=1.29 located on chromosomes 1q, 2p, 5q, 7p, 9q, 10p, 14q, 18q, and 19q for different <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These loci may harbor genes that regulate <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis either independently or via interactions of the genes within these regions </plain></SENT>
