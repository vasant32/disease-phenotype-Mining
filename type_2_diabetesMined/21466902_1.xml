<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We monitored chronological changes in bone turnover markers and a parameter of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, plaque score (PS), during glycemic control in Japanese patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and analyzed relationships among these parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Multiple regression analysis showed that changes in osteocalcin were negatively correlated with changes in HbA(1c) (β = -0.38, p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Baseline osteocalcin was negatively correlated with changes in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (β = -0.29, p = 0.03) and positively with changes in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> (β = 0.31, p = 0.03), and that changes in osteocalcin were negatively correlated with baseline <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> (β = -0.35, p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Changes in osteocalcin were positively correlated with baseline PS (β = 0.35, p = 0.01) and negatively with changes in PS (β = -0.30, p &lt; 0.05) independent of other conventional risk factors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings indicated the association between serum osteocalcin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism as well as an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> parameter independently of other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>-related risk factors in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, suggesting that osteocalcin is important for not only bone metabolism but also <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
