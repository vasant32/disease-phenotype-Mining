<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Under euglycemic conditions, renal blood flow was determined by a constant infusion of paraminohippurate and changes in blood pressure and renal vascular resistance estimated before and after an infusion of L-Ng-monomethyl-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the African-heritage group, there was a significant fall in renal blood flow (Delta-46.0 ml/min per 1.73 m(2); P &lt; 0.05) and rise in systolic blood pressure (Delta 10.0 mmHg [95% CI 2.3-17.9]; P = 0.017), which correlated with an increase in renal vascular resistance (r(2) = 0.77; P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The renal vasoconstrictive response associated with NO synthase inhibition in this study may be of relevance to the observed vulnerability to renal injury in patients of African heritage </plain></SENT>
