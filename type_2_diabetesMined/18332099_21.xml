<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the current study was to compare a direct measure of insulin secretion with fasting surrogate markers in relation to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In 1,380 individuals from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin Resistance</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Study, beta-cell function was assessed using a frequently sampled intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (first-phase insulin secretion; <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin response [AIR]), homeostasis model assessment of beta-cell function (HOMA-B), proinsulin levels, and the proinsulin-to-insulin ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Beta-cell function was cross-sectionally analyzed by <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance categories (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance [NGT], n = 712; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> [IGT], n = 353; newly diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> from an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test [OGTT] [DM2h], n = 80; newly diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> [DMf], n = 135; or newly diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by fasting and 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and established <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on diet/exercise only [DM], n = 100) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In Spearman correlation analyses, proinsulin and the proinsulin-to-insulin ratio were only modestly inversely related to AIR (r values from -0.02 to -0.27), and AIR was strongly related to HOMA-B (r values 0.56 and 0.58) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HOMA-B markedly underestimated the magnitude of the beta-cell defect across declining <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, especially for IGT and new DM by OGTT compared with AIR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analyses adjusting for insulin sensitivity showed that beta-cell function was compromised in IGT, DM2h, DMf, and DM, relative to NGT, by 13, 12, 59, and 62% (HOMA-B) and by as much as 40, 60, 80, and 75%, using AIR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Subjects with IGT and early-stage, asymptomatic type 2 diabetic patients have more pronounced beta-cell defects than previously estimated from epidemiological studies using homeostasis model assessment </plain></SENT>
