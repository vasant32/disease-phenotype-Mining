<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We studied the effect of four common polymorphisms (rs1920792, I27L, A98V and S487N) in and upstream of the HNF-1alpha gene on transcriptional activity in vitro, and their possible association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and insulin secretion in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Certain combinations of the I27L and A98V polymorphisms in the HNF-1alpha gene showed decreased transcriptional activity on the target promoters <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transporter 2 (now known as solute carrier family 2 [facilitated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transporter], member 2) and albumin in both HeLa and INS-1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In vivo, these polymorphisms were associated with a modest but significant impairment in insulin secretion in response to oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Insulin secretion deteriorated over time in individuals carrying the V allele of the A98V polymorphism (n = 2,293; p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a new case-control (n = 1,511 and n = 2,225 respectively) data set, the I27L polymorphism was associated with increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, odds ratio (OR) = 1.5 (p = 0.002; multiple logistic regression), particularly in elderly (age &gt; 60 years) and overweight (BMI &gt; 25 kg/m(2)) patients (OR = 2.3, p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: This study provides in vitro and in vivo evidence that common variants in the MODY3 gene, HNF-1alpha, influence transcriptional activity and insulin secretion in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These variants are associated with a modestly increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in subsets of elderly overweight individuals </plain></SENT>
