<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is not uncommon for people to spend one-half of their waking day sitting, with relatively idle muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The other half of the day includes the often large volume of nonexercise physical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Given the increasing pace of technological change in domestic, community, and workplace environments, modern humans may still not have reached the historical pinnacle of physical inactivity, even in cohorts where people already do not perform exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our purpose here is to examine the role of sedentary behaviors, especially sitting, on mortality, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> risk factors, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recent observational epidemiological studies strongly suggest that daily sitting time or low nonexercise activity levels may have a significant direct relationship with each of these medical concerns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There is now a need for studies to differentiate between the potentially unique molecular, physiologic, and clinical effects of too much sitting (inactivity <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp>) separate from the responses caused by structured exercise (exercise <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In theory, this may be in part because nonexercise activity thermogenesis is generally a much greater component of total energy expenditure than exercise or because any type of brief, yet frequent, muscular contraction throughout the day may be necessary to short-circuit unhealthy molecular signals causing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One of the first series of controlled laboratory studies providing translational evidence for a molecular reason to maintain high levels of daily low-intensity and intermittent activity came from examinations of the cellular regulation of skeletal muscle <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> lipase (LPL) (a protein important for controlling plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> catabolism, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, and other metabolic risk factors) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Experimentally reducing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> spontaneous standing and ambulatory time had a much greater effect on LPL regulation than adding vigorous exercise training on top of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> level of nonexercise activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Those studies also found that inactivity initiated unique cellular processes that were qualitatively different from the exercise responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In summary, there is an emergence of inactivity <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These are beginning to raise a new concern with potentially major clinical and public health significance: the average nonexercising person may become even more metabolically unfit in the coming years if they sit too much, thereby limiting the normally high volume of intermittent nonexercise physical activity in everyday life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, if the inactivity <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> paradigm is proven to be true, the dire concern for the future may rest with growing numbers of people unaware of the potential insidious dangers of sitting too much and who are not taking advantage of the benefits of maintaining nonexercise activity throughout much of the day </plain></SENT>
