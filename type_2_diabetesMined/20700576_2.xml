<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used the Action in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Vascular Disease</z:e>: Preterax and Diamicron Modified-Release Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE) study, a large, detailed, randomised controlled trial among a general population of individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For the purposes of the present analyses, data from the trial are used within a prospective cohort study design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 10,958 men and women, aged 55 to 88 years and with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, participated in a baseline medical examination, during which they counted their number of natural teeth and reported the number of days that their gums had bled over the preceding year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Study members were followed up for mortality and morbidity over 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After controlling for a range of potential confounding factors, the group with no teeth had a markedly increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> causes (HR 1.48, 95% CI 1.24-1.78), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> (1.35, 1.05-1.74) and non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> (1.64, 1.26-2.13), relative to the group with the most teeth (≥22 teeth) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Frequency of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> gums was not associated with any of the outcomes of interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no suggestion that treatment group or sex modified these relationships </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026636" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oral disease</z:e>, as indexed by fewer teeth, was related to an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> causes and of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> and non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
