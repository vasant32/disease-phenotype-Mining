<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> therapy versus placebo on the progression of carotid intima-media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) in type 2 diabetic patients without manifest <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial was performed in 250 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were given either 0.4 mg cerivastatin or placebo daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In August 2001, when cerivastatin was withdrawn from the market, 0.4 mg cerivastatin was replaced by 20 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> without deblinding the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was the change of mean common carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>, as measured by B-mode ultrasound, over 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Common carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> at baseline was 0.780 mm in the placebo group and 0.763 mm in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> group and did not change significantly after 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> change in any carotid segment between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> was reduced by 25% in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> group and increased by 8% in the placebo group (P &lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular events occurred in 12 patients in the placebo group and two patients in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> group (P=0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There was no effect of 2 years' <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> therapy on carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> in type 2 diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The natural history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> in our patients was milder than anticipated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In contrast, we observed a significantly lower cardiovascular event rate on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Prognostic tools other than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> should be explored in this patient group </plain></SENT>
