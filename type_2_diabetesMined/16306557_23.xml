<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Between 1993 and 1997, 16,330 women aged 49-70 years and free from <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were enrolled in one of the Dutch Prospect-EPIC (European Prospective Study Into <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> and Nutrition) cohorts and followed for 6.2 years (range 0.1-10.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At enrollment, women filled in questionnaires and blood samples were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During follow-up, 760 cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A linear inverse association (P = 0.007) between alcohol consumption and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk was observed, adjusting for potential confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with abstainers, the hazard ratio for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 0.86 (95% CI 0.66-1.12) for women consuming 5-30 g alcohol per week, 0.66 (0.48-0.91) for 30-70 g per week, 0.91 (0.67-1.24) for 70-140 g per week, 0.64 (0.44-0.93) for 140-210 g per week, and 0.69 (0.47-1.02) for &gt;210 g alcohol per week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Beverage type did not influence this association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lifetime alcohol consumption was associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a U-shaped fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the evidence of a decreased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with moderate alcohol consumption and expand this to a population of older women </plain></SENT>
