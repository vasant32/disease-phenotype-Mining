<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine whether nonglucose nutrient-induced insulin secretion is impaired in pre-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, subjects with impaired or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> were studied after ingesting either a mixed meal containing 75 g <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> or 75 g <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite comparable <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> areas above basal, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced insulin secretion was higher (P &lt; 0.05) and insulin action lower (P &lt; 0.05) during the meal than the oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subgroups regardless of whether they had abnormal or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (NGT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the nutrient-induced delta (meal minus OGTT) in insulin secretion and glucagon concentrations did not differ among groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the decrease in insulin action after meal ingestion was compensated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups by an appropriate increase in insulin secretion resulting in disposition indexes during meals that were equal to or greater than those present during the OGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, disposition indexes were reduced (P &lt; 0.01) during the OGTT in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> groups, indicating that reduced <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> induced insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that, whereas <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced insulin secretion is impaired in people with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001952'>abnormal glucose tolerance</z:hpo>, nonglucose nutrient-induced secretion is intact, suggesting that a <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-specific defect in the insulin secretory pathway is an early event in the evolution of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
