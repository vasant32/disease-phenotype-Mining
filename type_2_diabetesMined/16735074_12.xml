<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used extensive literature searching strategies to locate published and unpublished intervention studies that tested exercise interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted meta-analytic procedures using both fixed- and random-effects models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analyses were conducted separately for type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and separately for two-group and single-group data under two assumptions about pre-post fitness outcomes association: no association and a strong positive association (0.80) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Codable data were extracted from 35 reports with 1074 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> overall weighted mean effect size for two-group comparisons was 0.65 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For treatment group pretest versus post-test, the effect was 0.62 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The effect size among adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for two-group comparisons was 0.35 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The treatment group pretest versus post-test comparison effect was 0.37 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Effect sizes among control group participants were not statistically different from 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> two-group comparisons, larger effect sizes were associated with exercise prescription, fitness testing, supervised exercise, group sessions, and recommendations for longer duration exercise sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>HbA1c, age, body mass index, and gender distribution were unrelated to fitness outcomes </plain></SENT>
