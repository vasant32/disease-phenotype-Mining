<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since a diminished activity of vascular sGC has been reported in an animal model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the sGC activity was assayed in vitro in internal mammary artery specimens obtained during bypass surgery from patients with and without type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of sGC to NO, which is dependent on Fe(2+)-containing <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi>, was measured in vitro using stimulation with diethylamine NONOate (DEA/NO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, the novel cyclic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16750">guanosine</z:chebi> monophosphate-elevating compound HMR-1766 was used to test the stimulation of the oxidized <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi>-Fe(3+)-containing form of sGC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Basal activity of sGC and its sensitivity to stimulation by DEA/NO and HMR-1766 were not different between control and type 2 diabetic patients: maximum stimulation by DEA/NO amounted to 475 +/- 67 and 418 +/- 59 pmol </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the present findings do not support the hypothesis that desensitization of sGC contributes to the pathogenesis of diabetic vascular dysfunction in humans </plain></SENT>
