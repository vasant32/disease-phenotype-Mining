<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although it is widely believed that type 2 diabetics with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> (MS) have <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, the beta-cell function of these patients is largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the characteristics of insulin secretion in Japanese type 2 diabetics with MS after minimizing the influence of glucotoxity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 75-g OGTT was performed in 192 diabetic subjects and 275 subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (NGT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although there was no significant difference of the AUC (insulin(0-120)) between the MS group and the NGT group, the insulinogenic index (I.I.) was significantly lower in MS patients compared with NGT subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The BMI, maximum BMI, waist circumference, and VFA were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> positively correlated with I.I. in the MS group (r=0.298-0.376) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By stepwise multiple regression analysis, the BMI was shown to be an independent determinant of I.I. in the MS group (standardized regression coefficient: 0.376, p=0.0004), and it accounted for 13% of the variance in I.I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The impaired I.I. was also found in the MS group with untreated type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that early insulin secretion is impaired in type 2 diabetics with MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The positive association between BMI and I.I. in diabetics with MS may be explained by beta-cell compensation for reduced insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
