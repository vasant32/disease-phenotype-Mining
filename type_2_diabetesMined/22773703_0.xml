<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between serum adiponectin level and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of the insulin-sensitizing, anti-inflammatory, and antiatherogenic effects of adiponectin, we hypothesized that higher adiponectin level would be associated with lower <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 609 men and women aged 72 Â± 6.3 years with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and information on total and high molecular weight adiponectin were followed for a median of 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The longitudinal association between adiponectin and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality was analyzed with Cox proportional hazards models with time from adiponectin measurement to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> as the time-to-event variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analyses were adjusted for demographic variables and significant <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> parameters, significant cardiovascular parameters, and significant <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Total and high molecular weight adiponectin were highly correlated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The highest adiponectin quartile was strongly associated with higher <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality compared with the lowest quartile (hazard ratio = 4.0 [95% CI: 1.7-9.2]) in the fully adjusted model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results did not change in analyses stratified by sex and thiazolidinedione use, after exclusion of people who died within one year of adiponectin measurement, or when change in weight before adiponectin measurement was considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to our hypothesis, higher adiponectin level was related to higher <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This association was not explained by confounding by other characteristics, including medications or preceding <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
