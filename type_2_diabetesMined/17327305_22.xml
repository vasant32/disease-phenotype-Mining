<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3219">bupropion</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> (Wellbutrin XL) to determine whether this improvement could be attributed to changes in anthropometrics or <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Ninety-three patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1269683" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="MDD">major depressive disorder</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDD</z:e>) received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3219">bupropion</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> in a two-phase, open-label treatment trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Those who completed the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase (10 weeks; n = 75) and whose <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> remitted (n = 63) continued <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3219">bupropion</z:chebi> at the remission dose and were followed in the maintenance phase (24 weeks) until attrition (n = 8) or relapse of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDD</z:e> (n = 0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Self-report scales were used to measure <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> symptom severity and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-care behaviors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Body composition and glycemic control were determined using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and serial determinations of A1C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BMI, total fat mass, and A1C decreased and composite <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-care improved over the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase (-0.5 kg/m2, -0.7 kg, -0.5%, and +0.4, respectively, P &lt; 0.01 for each), effects that persisted through the maintenance phase for BMI, A1C, and self-care (P &lt; or = 0.01 for each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reductions in BMI (B = 0.30, P = 0.01) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> severity (B = 0.04, P = 0.046) independently predicted lower A1C after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase treatment, whereas only reduction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> severity (B = 0.08, P = 0.001) predicted A1C over the maintenance interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the short term, improvement in glycemic control during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3219">bupropion</z:chebi> treatment is predicted independently by improvements in mood and body composition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Longer-term improvements in glycemic control are predicted primarily by sustained improvement in mood via mechanisms independent of anthropometric and self-care modifications </plain></SENT>
