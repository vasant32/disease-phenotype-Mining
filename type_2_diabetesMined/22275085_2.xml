<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that insulin's effect to potentiate <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) would be diminished in insulin-resistant persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the effect of insulin to modulate GSIS in insulin-resistant compared with insulin-sensitive subjects, 10 participants with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT), 11 with T2D, and 8 healthy control subjects were studied on two occasions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The insulin secretory response was assessed by the administration of <z:chebi fb="10" ids="4167">dextrose</z:chebi> for 80 min following a 4-h clamp with either saline infusion (sham) or an isoglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp using B28-Asp-insulin (which can be distinguished immunologically from endogenous insulin) that raised insulin concentrations to high physiologic concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pre-exposure to insulin augmented GSIS in healthy persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This effect was attenuated in insulin-resistant cohorts, both those with IGT and those with T2D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Insulin potentiates <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion in insulin-resistant subjects to a lesser degree than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is consistent with an effect of insulin to regulate β-cell function in humans in vivo with therapeutic implications </plain></SENT>
