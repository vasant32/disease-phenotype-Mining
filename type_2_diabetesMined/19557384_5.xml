<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To obtain further insight into this topic, we performed a meta-analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> available case-control studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis of 32 studies (12,076 cases and 11,285 controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The relatively infrequent R972 variant was not significantly associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.96-1.23, p = 0.184 under a dominant model) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Some evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> was observed across studies (p = 0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the 14 studies (9,713 individuals) in which the mean age at type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosis was available, this variable explained 52% of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When these studies were subdivided into tertiles of mean age at diagnosis, the OR for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 1.48 (95% CI 1.17-1.87), 1.22 (95% CI 0.97-1.53) and 0.88 (95% CI 0.68-1.13) in the youngest, intermediate and oldest tertile, respectively (p = 0.0022 for trend of ORs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our findings illustrate the difficulties of ascertaining the contribution of 'low-frequency-low-risk' variants to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the specific context of the R972 variant, approximately 200,000 study individuals would be needed to have 80% power to identify a 9% increase in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk at a genome-wide significance level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Under these circumstances, a strategy aimed at improving outcome definition and decreasing its <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> may critically enhance our ability to detect genetic effects, thereby decreasing the required sample size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that focusing on early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, which is characterised by a stronger genetic background, may be part of such a strategy </plain></SENT>
