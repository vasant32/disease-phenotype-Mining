<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients were allocated to either a fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FBG) monitoring group with titration target 4.4-6.1 mmol/l or to a post-prandial blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (PPBG) monitoring group with titration target 4.4-8.0 mmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An initial titration period of up to 8 weeks was followed by a 12-week treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Glycaemic control and hypoglycaemic outcomes were compared for the respective groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HbA(1c) decreased significantly more in the FBG monitoring group by a mean of 1.38% compared to the PPBG group by a mean of 1.22% (P=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The glycaemic control targets were met by fewer patients in the FBG group than in the PPBG group (57% versus 86% (P&lt;0.001)) despite a higher mean dose of repaglinide in the FBG group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The within-patient blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> variability was significantly lower in the FBG group than in the PPBG group (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, repaglinide lowered the HbA(1c) effectively and safely in both groups and self-monitored FBG is a suitable parameter for titration of repaglinide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Whether a lower PPBG target might be as good a guide as FBG for titration of repaglinide should be addressed in a future study </plain></SENT>
