<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Participants were 333 patients (71% male; mean age 62 years; 73% with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> (DPN), but without <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo> (PVD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Severity of DPN and the presence of PVD were assessed by clinical examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo>, other <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> complications and foot self-care were assessed by self-report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cox regression tested whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> was an independent predictor of foot ulceration over 18 months, whether this relationship was moderated by foot <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> history, and whether foot self-care mediated this relationship </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During follow-up, 63 patients developed a foot <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Those with prior foot <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> had more than four-fold greater risk of subsequent foot ulceration compared with those without a history of foot <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significant interaction effect showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> was significantly related to the development of first but not recurrent foot <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This relationship was independent of biological risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the final model, each standard deviation increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> symptoms was significantly associated with increased risk of developing first foot <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> (HR 1.68, 95% CI 1.20-2.35), while foot self-care was associated with lower risk (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.40-0.94) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Foot self-care did not mediate the relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and foot ulceration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These data suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> is associated with increased risk of first foot <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> in DPN patients and that this relationship is independent of biological risk factors and foot self-care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Interventions that target <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and foot self-care before the development of foot <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> may maximise the likelihood of successful prevention of foot ulceration </plain></SENT>
