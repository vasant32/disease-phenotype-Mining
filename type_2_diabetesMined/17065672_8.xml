<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this prospective study, 910 adults aged &gt;/=50 years without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at baseline in 1984-1987 were followed to 1992-1996, an average of 8 years after assessment of coffee intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression models were adjusted for sex, age, physical activity, BMI, smoking, alcohol, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and baseline fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Past and current coffee drinkers had a reduced risk of incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (odds ratio 0.38 [95% CI 0.17-0.87] and 0.36 [0.19-0.68], respectively) compared with those who never drank coffee </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 317 participants with baseline impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> who were past or current coffee drinkers were also at reduced risk for incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (0.31 [0.11-0.87] and 0.36 [0.16-0.83], respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms a striking protective effect of caffeinated coffee against incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and extends these findings to incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> based on OGTT independent of multiple plausible confounders </plain></SENT>
