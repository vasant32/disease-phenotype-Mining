<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Ghrelin, isolated from the human and rat stomach, is the endogenous ligand for the growth hormone (GH) secretagogue receptor, which is expressed in a variety of tissues, including the pancreatic islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that low plasma ghrelin levels correlates with elevated fasting insulin levels and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we show a physiological role of endogenous ghrelin in the regulation of insulin release and blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in rodents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Acylated ghrelin, the active form of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, was detected in the pancreatic islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Counteraction of endogenous ghrelin by intraperitoneal injection of specific GH secretagogue receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> markedly lowered fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations, attenuated plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> elevation, and enhanced insulin responses during the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GTT</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conversely, intraperitoneal exogenous ghrelin GH-independently elevated fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations, enhanced plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> elevation, and attenuated insulin responses during <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GTT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neither GH secretagogue receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> nor ghrelin affected the profiles of the insulin tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In isolated islets, GH secretagogue receptor blockade and antiserum against acylated ghrelin markedly enhanced <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced increases in insulin release and intracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> concentration ([<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i), whereas ghrelin at a relatively high concentration (10 nmol/l) suppressed insulin release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In single beta-cells, ghrelin attenuated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced first-phase and oscillatory [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i increases via the GH secretagogue receptor and in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043167" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pertussis</z:e> toxin-sensitive manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ghrelin also increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44296">tetraethylammonium</z:chebi>-sensitive delayed outward K+ currents in single beta-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings reveal that endogenous ghrelin in islets acts on beta-cells to restrict <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced insulin release at least partly via attenuation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> signaling, and that this insulinostatic action may be implicated in the upward control of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This function of ghrelin, together with inducing GH release and feeding, suggests that ghrelin underlies the integrative regulation of energy homeostasis </plain></SENT>
