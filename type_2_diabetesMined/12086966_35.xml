<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A microsatellite polymorphism 1 kb upstream to the IGF-I gene has recently been associated with several adult phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a large Dutch cohort, the absence of the commonest allele (Z) was associated with reduced serum IGF-I levels, <z:mp ids='MP_0001255'>reduced height</z:mp>, and an increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This result has not been replicated, and the role of this polymorphism in these traits in U.K. subjects is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We sought further evidence for the involvement of this variant in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> using a case-control study and IGF-I and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related traits in a population cohort of 640 U.K. individuals aged 25 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Absence of the common allele was not associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (odds ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.47-1.04 for X/X versus Z/Z genotype, chi(2) test for trend across genotypes, P = 0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the population cohort, the common allele (Z) was associated with decreased IGF-I levels (P = 0.01), contrary to the Dutch study, but not with adult height (P = 0.23), <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (P = 0.84), oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test-derived values of beta-cell function (P = 0.90), or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (P = 0.66) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no association with measures of fetal growth, including birth weight (P = 0.17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results do not support the previous associations and suggest that the promoter microsatellite is unlikely to be functionally important </plain></SENT>
