<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, concerns over potential diabetogenic actions of growth hormone complicate its anticipated use to treat type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, an animal model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> could help evaluate the effects of growth hormone for treating this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male C57BL/6J mice were placed on a high-fat diet to induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Starting at 16 weeks of age, mice were treated once daily for 6 weeks with one of four different doses of growth hormone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Body weight, body composition, fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, liver triacylglycerol, tissue weights and blood chemistries were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Body composition measurements revealed a dose-dependent decrease in fat and an increase in lean mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis of fat loss by depot revealed that subcutaneous and mesenteric fat was the most sensitive to growth hormone treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, growth hormone treatment resulted in improvement in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism, with the highest dose normalising <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance and liver triacylglycerol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, insulin levels were not altered by the treatment, nor did organ weights change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, fasting plasma leptin and resistin were significantly decreased after growth hormone treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Growth hormone therapy improves <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in this mouse model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, providing a means to explore the molecular mechanism(s) of this treatment </plain></SENT>
