<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to directly compare the prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Asian Americans with other racial and ethnic groups in the U.S. using data from the 2001 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The BRFSS is a population-based telephone survey of the health status and health behaviors of Americans in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 50 states, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects included 3,071 Asians, 12,561 blacks, 12,153 Hispanics, 2,299 Native Americans, 626 Pacific Islanders, and 129,116 non-Hispanic whites aged &gt;/=30 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subjects who reported a physician-diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were considered to have type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> unless they were diagnosed before age 30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with whites, odds ratios (95% CIs) for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, adjusted for age and sex, were 1.0 (0.7-1.4) for Asians, 2.3 (2.1-2.6) for blacks, 2.0 (1.8-2.3) for Hispanics, 2.2 (1.6-2.9) for Native Americans, and 3.1 (1.4-6.8) for Pacific Islanders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results adjusted for BMI, age, and sex were 1.6 (1.2-2.3) for Asians, 1.9 (1.7-2.2) for blacks, 1.9 (1.6-2.1) for Hispanics, 1.8 (1.3-2.5) for Native Americans, and 3.0 (1.4-6.7) for Pacific Islanders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Similar proportions of Asian and non-Hispanic white Americans report having <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but after accounting for the lower BMI of Asians, the adjusted prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is 60% higher in Asian Americans </plain></SENT>
