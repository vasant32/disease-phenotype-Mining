<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We screened for differentially expressed genes in skeletal muscle of Psammomys obesus (Israeli sand rats), and prioritised these on the basis of genomic localisation and bioinformatics analysis for proteins with likely <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> intramembrane protease, known as presenilins-associated rhomboid-like protein (PSARL) that is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression of PSARL was reduced in skeletal muscle of diabetic Psammomys obesus, and restored after exercise training to successfully treat the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PSARL gene expression in human skeletal muscle was correlated with insulin sensitivity as assessed by <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal during a hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 1,031 human subjects, an amino acid substitution (Leu262Val) in PSARL was associated with increased plasma insulin concentration, a key risk factor for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, this variant interacted strongly with age to affect insulin levels, accounting for 5% of the variation in plasma insulin in elderly subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Variation in PSARL sequence and/or expression may be an important new risk factor for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and other components of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
