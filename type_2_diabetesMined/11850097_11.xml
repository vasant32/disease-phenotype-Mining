<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To assess the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering efficacy, responsiveness, duration of action and impact on quality-of-life of hydroxychloroquine (HXCHL), when added as an antihyperglycemic agent to patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi>-refractory type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and thirty-five <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (mean age 57.5 years) and a glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (GHb) &gt; or = 11% despite maximum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> were randomly allocated to the addition of HXCHL (up to 300 mg bid) or placebo and followed for up to 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Randomization was stratified by baseline GHb (&lt;13.5% versus &gt; or = 13.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was 'blinded' withdrawal of study drug due to unacceptable glycemic control; GHb, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, and quality of life were also assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Those on placebo were more likely to be withdrawn from study drug because of unacceptable glycemic control than patients randomized to HXCHL (95.5 and 69.6% given placebo and HXCHL, respectively; P=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the first 6 months, HXCHL decreased GHb by an absolute amount of 1.02% more than placebo (95% CI 0.24, 1.81) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> tolerance and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> improved during the first 3 months of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant adverse effects were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Factors that predicted responsiveness included an initial GHb &lt;13.5%, early responsiveness to study drug, and no prior <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Lower GHb levels at baseline predicted a better response; the hazard of withdrawal increased 36% (95% CI 11%, 66%) for every 1% increase in GHb even in patients whose baseline GHb was &lt;13.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: HXCHL improves glycemic control in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi>-refractory patients with poorly controlled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
