<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two new questionnaires were validated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Outpatients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treated with sulphonylurea agents (n=131) completed the seven-item <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Tablet Treatment Questionnaire (DTTQ) and nine-item <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Food Timing Questionnaire (DFTQ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean glycosylated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA1c) was 7.8% (S.D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>1.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At least 74% had optimal DTTQ item scores for tablet-taking as recommended, difficulty taking tablets, side effects, perceived <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> and willingness to continue current tablets, but 71% scored sub-optimally regarding recent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Under half scored optimally on DFTQ items concerning eating at recommended times, difficulty with food-timing, denying oneself food and guilt about eating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Principal components and reliability analyses identified a two-item tablet problem scale within the DTTQ (alpha 0.72) and a seven-item food-timing problem scale in the DFTQ (alpha 0.77) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Satisfaction and adherence were not closely related to glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only scores for perceived <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> (r=0.38), perceived <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> (r=-0.24) and satisfaction to continue current tablets (r=-0.20) correlated significantly with HbA1c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Clinicians found that the DTTQ helped to raise tablet-taking issues otherwise missed in consultations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Both questionnaires can be used to guide the need for focussed discussion, educational intervention and/or treatment change and to evaluate their impact </plain></SENT>
