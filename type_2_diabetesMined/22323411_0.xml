<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Process and intermediate measures of quality of care were compared between 246 South Asians, 170 Chinese, and 431 patients from the general population with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> selected from 45 family physicians' practices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 61% of Chinese achieved A1C ≤7.0% versus 45% of South Asians and 49% of the general population (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were also more likely to achieve <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> ≤2.0 mmol/L, while South Asians were more likely to achieve blood pressure ≤130/80 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was only one significant process of care deficiency: fewer foot examinations among South Asians (34 vs. 49% for the general population, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Quality of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care in a Canadian urban setting was equitable, with ethnic minorities somewhat more likely to achieve recommended targets than the general population </plain></SENT>
