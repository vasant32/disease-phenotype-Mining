<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to re-evaluate the indications for renal biopsy in the diabetic patients, we retrospectively analyzed the relationship between clinical features and histological diagnosis in 97 Japanese patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> manifesting overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Renal biopsy was performed because they were clinically suspected to have NDRD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into three groups according to the histological diagnosis: (1) the DN group (n=35) had only diabetic lesions, (2) the complicated group (n=16) had histological changes of NDRD superimposed on DN and (3) the non-DN group (n=46) had NDRD without diabetic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the specificity and sensitivity of four clinical parameters (duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, presence or absence of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002907'>microscopic hematuria</z:hpo> and granular casts as urinary sediments) for the prediction of NDRD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Short duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (&lt;5 years) showed high sensitivity (75%) and specificity (70%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> showed the highest sensitivity (87%) and specificity (93%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002907'>microscopic hematuria</z:hpo> (56 and 58%) and granular casts (68 and 47%) were lower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our study confirmed that the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> and short duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are useful clinical indications for renal biopsy in diabetic patients with overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
