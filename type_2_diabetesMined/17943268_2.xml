<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 1,345) and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 1,072), diagnosed between 1992 and 1996, were collected from four sources: standardised national reports from <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> nurses, the National Hospital Discharge Register, the Drug Prescription Register and the Drug Reimbursement Register </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Information on matched controls and the family members of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> study subjects were obtained from the National Population Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The odds ratios (ORs) for both types of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were estimated using a conditional logistic regression model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a U-shaped relationship between maternal age and the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the offspring: the risk was higher in children born to young and old mothers compared with children born to mothers aged around 30 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The children born second (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.62-0.94), third (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.55-0.95), or fourth (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.47-0.94) had a lower risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than the first-born children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Maternal age, paternal age, and birth order did not have an effect on the risk of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the individuals aged 15-39 years at the time of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Maternal age and birth order are both associated with the risk of early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, part of these associations may be due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birthweight</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this study neither parental age nor birth order showed a significant association with the risk of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosed after 15 years of age </plain></SENT>
