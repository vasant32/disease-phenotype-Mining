<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that low IGF-I and high IGF-binding protein (IGFBP)-1 predict future cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e>) and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>Diabetes Mellitus</z:hpo> Insulin-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> Infusion in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>Myocardial Infarction</z:hpo> (DIGAMI) 2 Trial recruited 1,253 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e>, of whom 575 were enrolled in a biochemical program with repeated blood sampling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Primary and secondary end points included adjudicated cardiovascular mortality and a composite of cardiovascular events (cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, reinfarction, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multiple Cox proportional hazard regression was used to study the relationship between the end points and the variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Admission variables were used for the survival analysis and for blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and A1C updated mean values during follow-up were also available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During a median follow-up period of 2.2 years, 131 (23%) patients died from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality and 102 (18%) from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>, whereas 175 patients (30%) suffered from at least one cardiovascular event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The independent predictors for cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the Cox regression model were (as hazard ratio [HR] [95% CI]): ln updated mean blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (12.2 [5.8-25.7]), age (+5 years) (1.5 [1.4-1.7]), ln IGFBP-1 (1.4 [1.1-1.8]), and ln serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> at admission (2.4 [1.3-4.2]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The model predicting cardiovascular events contained the same variables (ln IGFBP-1 at admission, 1.2 [1.0-1.4]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High levels of IGFBP-1 at admission are associated with increased risk for cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> </plain></SENT>
