<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 2035 patients were enrolled; approximately 95% were classified as having Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study was open with no control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Physicians had sole control of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> doses prescribed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> were generally low, and hence well-tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi>-associated adverse effects and withdrawals was 7.5 and 2.5%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No sustained adverse changes in laboratory parameters occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, 1- and 2-h postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, HbA1c or HbA1, and other clinical parameters, such as blood cell counts and liver enzyme levels were also assessed as measures of efficacy and safety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Over the 2 years the mean fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level decreased by 2.39 mmol/l in patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, while mean 1- and 2-h postprandial blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels both decreased by 3.56 mmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>HbA1 and HbA1c decreased by 2.0 and 1.1 percentage points, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that when used in long-term day-to-day management of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> is well tolerated and can improve glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
