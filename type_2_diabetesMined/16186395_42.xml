<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated prospectively the association between serum levels of interleukin (IL)-18 and the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a case-cohort study conducted in middle-aged men and women who represented 7,936 participants of the three MONItoring of trends and determinants in CArdiovascular disease (MONICA)/Cooperative Research in the Region of Augsburg (KORA) surveys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Levels of IL-18 were measured in stored samples of 527 case subjects with incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 1,698 noncase subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Elevated levels of IL-18 were associated with a significantly increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after adjustment for age, sex, survey, BMI, systolic blood pressure, ratio of total cholesterol to <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, physical activity, alcohol intake, smoking status, and parental history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals comparing quartile extremes were 1.73 (1.25-2.40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further adjustment for C-reactive protein and IL-6 had no impact on the observed associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was highest among subjects with elevated levels of both IL-18 and CRP or IL-18 and IL-6, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, elevated levels of IL-18 are associated with a considerably increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This association is independent of a generalized proinflammatory state, but subjects with elevated levels of several inflammatory markers seem to be particularly prone to develop type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
