<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test and demographic (age, sex, family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and ethnicity), clinical (BMI z score, waist circumference, and pubertal stage), and laboratory variables used in current pediatric screening criteria for type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> were measured in 259 overweight or <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> youth aged 5-17 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Glycemic status was based on American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association (<z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi>) thresholds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The performance (sensitivity and specificity) of current screening criteria and newly developed models to identify isolated IGT were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Dysglycemia was present in 20.8% of the cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 54 participants with dysglycemia, 68% had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and were identified with the 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Current <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> criteria had low sensitivity (41.7% [95% CI 25.6-57.8]) and moderate specificity (69.5% [63.5-75.6]) to identify IGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, the addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c) (HbA(1c)) or FPG did not improve the ROC area under the curve (AUC) (HbA(1c): 0.64 vs. 0.63; P = 0.54; HbA(1c) + FPG: 0.66; P = 0.42), but adding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> level did (AUC 0.72 vs. 0.63; P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A simple model with fasting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> level &gt;1.17 mmol/L improved AUC compared with <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> screening criteria (0.68 vs. 0.57; P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of IGT is high among <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> children and youth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Current screening criteria have low sensitivity to detect isolated IGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although adding nonfasting laboratory values to history and physical measures does not improve diagnostic accuracy, adding fasting <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile improves predictive value </plain></SENT>
