<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To monitor glycemic control, treatable risk factors, and treatment profile for quality assessment of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care on a national scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Four samples of 23,546, 32,903, 30,311, and 29,769 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (1996-1999) were studied based on a repeated national screening and quality assessment of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care by the National <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Register, Sweden, with participation of both hospitals and primary health care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical characteristics included were age, sex, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration and treatment, glycemic control (HbA(1c)), office blood pressure (BP), BMI, smoking habits, and use of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering drugs in patients with type 1 or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Favorable decreases of mean HbA(1c) and BP values were registered during the 4-year study period for both type 1 (HbA(1c) 7.5-7.3% and BP 130/75-130/74 mmHg) and type 2 diabetic patients (HbA(1c) 7.0-6.7% and BP 151/82-147/80 mmHg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment aims of HbA(1c) and BP levels were also achieved in increasing proportions for type 1 (HbA(1c) &lt;7.5%: 50-58% and BP &lt;/=140/85 mmHg: 77-79%), and type 2 diabetic patients (HbA(1c) &lt;7.5%: 66-73% and BP &lt;/=140/85 mmHg: 32-42%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The use of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering drugs increased for type 1 (4-11%) and type 2 diabetic patients (10-22%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In type 2 diabetic patients, treatment with oral agents alone decreased, but combination therapy (insulin and oral agents) increased during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean BMI increased during 1996-1999 in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>High HbA(1c) and BP values in 1999 were predicted by high BMI values 1996 and by high increase of BMI during the period, independent of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration, age, and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Decreasing mean HbA(1c) and BP levels and the wider use of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering drugs during the late 1990s in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a national sample from Sweden should translate into clinical benefits regarding micro- and macrovascular complications as well as <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related mortality </plain></SENT>
