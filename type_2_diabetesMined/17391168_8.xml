<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with T2DM, insulin secretagogues are empirically used as first choice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this investigator-initiated trial, we evaluated the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> vs. an insulin secretagogue, repaglinide on glycaemic regulation and markers of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and insulin sensitivity in non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A single-centre, double-masked, double-dummy, crossover study during 2 x 4 months involved 96 non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (body mass index &lt; or = 27 kg/m(2)) insulin-na√Øve patients with T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At enrolment, previous oral hypoglycaemic agents (OHA) were stopped and patients entered a 1-month run-in on diet-only treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hereafter, patients were randomized to either repaglinide 2 mg thrice daily followed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> 1 g twice daily or vice versa each during 4 months with 1-month washout between interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: End-of-treatment levels of <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c) (HbA(1c)), fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, mean of seven-point home-monitored plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and fasting levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and adiponectin were not significantly different between treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, body weight, waist circumference, fasting serum levels of insulin and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> were lower and less number of patients experienced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> during treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> vs. repaglinide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both drugs were well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with T2DM, overall glycaemic regulation was equivalent with less <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> vs. repaglinide treatment for 2 x 4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> was more effective targeting non-glycaemic cardiovascular risk markers related to total and abdominal body fat stores as well as fasting insulinaemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings may suggest the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> as the preferred OHA also in non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with T2DM </plain></SENT>
