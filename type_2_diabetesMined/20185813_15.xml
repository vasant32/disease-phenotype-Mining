<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the role of impaired GIP function in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis and development of the <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> pancreas in a large animal model, we generated transgenic pigs expressing a dominant-negative GIP receptor (GIPR(dn)) in pancreatic islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: GIPR(dn) transgenic pigs were generated using lentiviral transgenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Metabolic tests and quantitative stereological analyses of the different <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> islet cell populations were performed, and beta-cell proliferation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were quantified to characterize this novel animal model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eleven-week-old GIPR(dn) transgenic pigs exhibited significantly reduced oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance due to delayed insulin secretion, whereas intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance and pancreatic beta-cell mass were not different from controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The insulinotropic effect of GIP was significantly reduced, whereas insulin secretion in response to the GLP-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> exendin-4 was enhanced in GIPR(dn) transgenic versus control pigs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With increasing age, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control deteriorated in GIPR(dn) transgenic pigs, as shown by reduced oral and intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948379" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">impaired insulin secretion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Importantly, beta-cell proliferation was reduced by 60% in 11-week-old GIPR(dn) transgenic pigs, leading to a reduction of beta-cell mass by 35% and 58% in 5-month-old and 1- to 1.4-year-old transgenic pigs compared with age-matched controls, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The first large animal model with impaired incretin function demonstrates an essential role of GIP for insulin secretion, proliferation of beta-cells, and physiological expansion of beta-cell mass </plain></SENT>
