<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: In advanced beta-cell failure, counterregulatory glucagon responses may be impaired due to a reduced decrement in insulin secretion during the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present studies were therefore undertaken to test the hypothesis that these may be improved by increasing this decrement in insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Twelve subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who have been insulin requiring were studied as a model of advanced beta-cell failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Glucagon responses were examined during a 90-min hypoglycemic clamp (approximately 2.8 mmol/l) on two separate occasions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On one occasion, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27999">tolbutamide</z:chebi> was infused for 2 h before the clamp so that the decrement in insulin secretion during the induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> would be increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other occasion, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline was infused as a control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Before the hypoglycemic clamp, infusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27999">tolbutamide</z:chebi> <z:mp ids='MP_0003058'>increased insulin secretion</z:mp> approximately 1.9-fold (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, during <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>, insulin secretion decreased to similar rates on both occasions (P = 0.31) so that its decrement was approximately twofold greater following the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27999">tolbutamide</z:chebi> infusion (1.63 +/- 0.20 vs. 0.81 +/- 0.17 pmol x kg(-1) x min(-1), P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This was associated with more than twofold-greater glucagon responses (42 +/- 11 vs. 19 +/- 8 ng/l, P &lt; 0.002) during the hypoglycemic clamp but unaltered glucagon responses to intravenous arginine immediately thereafter (449 +/- 50 vs. 453 +/- 50 ng/l, P = 0.78) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Increasing the decrement in insulin secretion during the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> improves counterregulatory glucagon responses in advanced beta-cell failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings further support the concept that the impaired counterregulatory glucagon responses in advanced beta-cell failure may at least partially be due to a reduced decrement in insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
