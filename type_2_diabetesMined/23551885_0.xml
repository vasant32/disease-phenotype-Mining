<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> continues to skyrocket across the industrialized world leading to soaring medical costs, reduced quality of life, and increased mortality rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a more firm understanding of the development of the disease and effective, low cost therapies for prevention and treatment are desperately needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Accumulating evidence suggests that increased sedentary time (i.e. "sitting time") combined with reduced physical activity levels, plays both a major role in the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and may contribute to the worsening of the condition after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this review we cover these topics and use current scientific evidence to support our belief that "type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> sits in a chair" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="?"><plain>We also discuss a relatively new question that has yet to be examined: would reducing sitting time be an effective treatment for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
