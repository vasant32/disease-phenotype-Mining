<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there have been no reports that insulin administration triggers pancreatic beta-cell destruction in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated three patients who had suffered from type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> for 5-30 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After an episode of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0009831'>mononeuropathy</z:hpo> or poor glycemic control, they started human insulin therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients' serum or urinary C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels were preserved before insulin therapy, whereas within a few months they rapidly declined to below detection limits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A high titer of insulin antibody was detected at or after the development of insulin deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Shortly after the initiation of insulin therapy, two of the patients developed an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0571622" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">insulin allergy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Autoantibodies to GAD65 or IA-2 were negative throughout the clinical course in two cases, but transiently positive in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a histological examination of pancreas tissue obtained by a pancreatic biopsy in one case, mononuclear cell infiltration into the islets was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>They <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had a type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> high-risk HLA class II haplotype in Japanese, and class I alleles of the insulin gene VNTR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The above findings suggest that insulin administration may have triggered pancreatic beta-cell destruction in these patients </plain></SENT>
