<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine causes of interindividual variation in insulin requirements, we recruited 20 type 2 diabetic patients with stable <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control and insulin doses for &gt;1 year on combination therapy with bedtime <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Insulin absorption (increase in free and total insulin over 8 h after a subcutaneous dose of regular insulin) and actions of intravenous (6-h 0.3 mU x kg(-1) x min(-1) euglycemic insulin clamp combined with [3-3H]<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>) and subcutaneous (<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion rate required to maintain isoglycemia and suppression of free fatty acids [FFAs]) insulin, liver fat content (proton spectroscopy), visceral fat (magnetic resonance imaging), weight, and body composition were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found the following variation in parameters: insulin dose range 10-176 U (mean 42 U, fold variation 17.6x) or 0.13-1.39 U/kg (0.44 U/kg, 10.7x), absorbed insulin 10.6x, action of subcutaneous insulin to suppress FFAs 7.5 x and to stimulate <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism (M value) 11.5x, body weight 67-127 kg (91 kg, 1.9x), liver fat 2-28% (12%, 14x), and visceral fat 179-2,053 ml (1,114 ml, 11.5x) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The amount of insulin absorbed, measured as either free or total insulin, was significantly correlated with its ability to suppress FFAs and stimulate <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism but not with the insulin dose per se </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The actions of absorbed insulin were, on the other hand, significantly correlated with the daily insulin dose (r = 0.70 for action on FFAs, P &lt; 0.001, and r = -0.61 for M value, P &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Actions of subcutaneous and intravenous insulin to suppress FFAs were significantly correlated (r = 0.82, P &lt; 0.001, R2 = 67%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the measures of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e>, the percent hepatic fat was the parameter best correlated with the daily insulin dose (r = 0.76, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The percent hepatic fat was also significantly correlated with the ability of intravenous insulin to suppress endogenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production (r = 0.72, P &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the major reason for interindividual variation in insulin requirements in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is the variation in insulin action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Variation in hepatic fat content may influence insulin requirements via an effect on the sensitivity of endogenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production to insulin </plain></SENT>
