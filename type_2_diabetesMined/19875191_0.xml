<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To determine the health system costs, cost to people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and their carers, and impact on quality of life associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Vanuatu </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cross-sectional paper based survey was administered to 199 people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> as part of a larger <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> project </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 172 respondents (86% response rate) with a mean age of 56 years (mean duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> 8 years, 106 females; 67 unemployed) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Over the preceding year there were 2352 outpatient visits for health care totalling 442,400 vatu ($4020 USD); 140 overnight hospital stays totalling 1,383,620 vatu ($12,580 USD); and prescription medications costing 3220 vatu/person ($29.20 USD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Major out-of-pocket costs for individuals were the over-the-counter medications totalling 6600 vatu/person/year ($60 USD) for 31 people (18%); transport at 1980 vatu/person/year ($18.00 USD) for 110 people (64%) and special diets for 38 people (22%) costing 36,480 vatu/person ($332 USD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Quality of life was 91/100 on the EQ-5D visual analogue scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Given that <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Vanuatu is likely to be significantly under-diagnosed and under-treated the current costs, while substantial are artificially low but are set to rise sharply with increased awareness of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and growing rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
