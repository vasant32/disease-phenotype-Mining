<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Functional health status and treatment satisfaction were investigated using the 36-Item Short-Form (SF-36) Health Survey, the World Health Organization Well-Being Questionnaire (WBQ), and the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Significant improvements were detected in most SF-36 domains, in WBQ <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> scores, and in treatment satisfaction, without differences between study groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: An insulin regimen that substantially improves metabolic control, while minimizing the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>, can positively affect physical and psychologic well-being and treatment satisfaction irrespective of the educational support system used </plain></SENT>
