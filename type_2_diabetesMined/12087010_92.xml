<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Conventional <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk factors (sex, age, smoking, plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, blood pressure, and metabolic control) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (estimated by HOMA) were evaluated at baseline in 1,326 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> examined within the Verona <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Complications Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At baseline and after a mean follow-up of 4.5 years, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> was assessed by medical history, physical examination, electrocardiography, and echo-Doppler of carotid and lower limb arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> certificates and medical records of subjects who died during the follow-up were carefully scrutinized to identify cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In statistical analyses, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> was an aggregate end point including both fatal and nonfatal coronary, cerebrovascular, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo> as well as ischemic electrocardiographic abnormalities and vascular lesions identified by echo-Doppler </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, 441 subjects were coded positive for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> (prevalent cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Incident cases numbered 126 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analyses showed that, along with sex, age, smoking, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>/total cholesterol ratio, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, HOMA-IR was an independent predictor of both prevalent and incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A 1-unit increase in (log)HOMA-IR value was associated with an odds ratio for prevalent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> at baseline of 1.31 (95% CI 1.10-1.56, P = 0.002) and for incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> during follow-up of 1.56 (95% CI 1.14-2.12, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: HOMA-IR is an independent predictor of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The improvement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> might have beneficial effects not only on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control but also on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
