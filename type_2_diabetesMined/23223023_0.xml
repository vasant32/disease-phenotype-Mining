<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether and how PA diabetic (d-PA) concentrations affected endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) and bone marrow-derived hematopoietic cell (BM-HC) biology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PA physiologic (n-PA) and d-PA concentrations were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Proliferating cell nuclear antigen content and signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5), PPARγ, cyclin D1, and p21(Waf) expression were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> technology, gene reporter luciferase assay, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, and coimmunoprecipitation were exploited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vivo studies and migration assays were also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>d-PA, unlike n-PA or physiological and diabetic oleic and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28842">stearic acid</z:chebi> concentrations, impaired EPC migration and EPC/BM-HC proliferation through a PPARγ-mediated STAT5 transcription inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This event did not prevent the formation of a STAT5/PPARγ transcriptional complex but was crucial for gene targeting, as p21(Waf) gene promoter, unlike cyclin D1, was the STAT5/PPARγ transcriptional target </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similar molecular events could be detected in EPCs isolated from type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By expressing a constitutively activated STAT5 form, we demonstrated that STAT5 content is crucial for gene targeting and EPC fate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Finally, we also provide in vivo data that d-PA-mediated EPC dysfunction could be rescued by PPARγ blockade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data provide first insights on how mechanistically d-PA drives EPC/BM-HC dysfunction in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
