<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of poorly controlled but already drug-treated patients, 52% did not receive intensification for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> medication, 81% not for <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering medication, and 43% not for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering medication </plain></SENT>
