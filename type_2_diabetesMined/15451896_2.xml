<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a prospective study of 34,097 men and women aged 40-69 years born in Greece, Italy, Australia, or New Zealand who were free from <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> self-reported cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at the 4-year follow-up, a confirmation of diagnosis was sought from medical practitioners </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these, anyone for whom there was no evidence against a diagnosis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was considered a case subject </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Follow-up was completed by 29,331 (86%) participants, and 334 case subjects were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among Greek (2.6%) and Italian (2.4%) migrants was more than three times that in Australian-born (0.7%) individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for age only, the odds ratios (ORs) for being of Greek and Italian origin compared with Australian origin were 3.8 (95% CI 2.9-5.0) and 3.3 (2.6-4.3), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The only known risk factor for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> that materially affected these ORs was BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for BMI and age, the ORs for being of Greek and Italian origin, respectively, were 2.4 (1.8-3.2) and 2.0 (1.5-2.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Greek and Italian migrants to Australia have a more than three times greater incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than Australian-born individuals, and this is only partly explained by BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although weight control will remain important for these high-risk groups, identification of other risk factors is required </plain></SENT>
