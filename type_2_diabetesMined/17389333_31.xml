<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We sought to examine the relation of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> to incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> (CHD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A population-based, prospective cohort study consisting of 1,524 middle-aged individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> without prevalent CHD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at baseline was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> signs were graded from <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> photographs according to the Early Treatment for Diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>Retinopathy</z:hpo> Study severity scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Incident CHD events (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, fatal CHD, or coronary revascularization) were identified and validated following standardized protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In our study, 214 (14.7%) participants had diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Over an average follow-up of 7.8 years, there were 209 (13.7%) incident CHD events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After controlling for age, sex, race, study center, fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, A1C, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, blood pressure, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> treatment, cigarette smoking, BMI, and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile, the presence of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> was associated with a twofold higher risk of incident CHD events (hazard rate ratio [HR] 2.07 [95% CI 1.38-3.11]) and a threefold higher risk of fatal CHD (3.35 [1.40-8.01]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further adjustments for inflammatory markers, carotid artery intima-media thickness, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> had minimal impact on the association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The increased risk of CHD was significant in both men (1.89 [1.08-3.31]) and women (2.16 [1.16-4.02]) with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> signifies an increased CHD risk, independent of known risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data support the role of microvascular disease in the pathogenesis of CHD in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
