<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The bifunctional enzyme 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/<z:chebi fb="15" ids="28757">fructose</z:chebi>-2,6-bisphosphatase (PFK-2/FBPase-2) was recently identified as a new intracellular binding partner for glucokinase (GK) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we studied the importance of this interaction for the activity status of GK and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in insulin-producing cells by overexpression of the rat liver and pancreatic islet isoforms of PFK-2/FBPase-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PFK-2/FBPase-2 overexpression in RINm5F-GK cells significantly increased the GK activity by 78% in cells expressing the islet isoform, by 130% in cells expressing the liver isoform, and by 116% in cells expressing a cAMP-insensitive liver S32A/H258A double mutant isoform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only in cells overexpressing the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> liver PFK-2/FBPase-2 isoform was the increase of GK activity abolished by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42471">forskolin</z:chebi>, apparently due to the regulatory site for phosphorylation by a cAMP-dependent protein kinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In cells overexpressing any isoform of the PFK-2/FBPase-2, the increase of the GK enzyme activity was antagonized by treatment with anti-FBPase-2 antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increasing the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration from 2 to 10 mmol/l had a significant stimulatory effect on the GK activity in RINm5F-GK cells overexpressing any isoform of PFK-2/FBPase-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The interaction of GK with PFK-2/FBPase-2 takes place at <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations that are physiologically relevant for the activation of GK and the regulation of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This new mechanism of posttranslational GK regulation may also represent a new site for pharmacotherapeutic intervention in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treatment </plain></SENT>
