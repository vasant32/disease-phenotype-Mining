<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate the effect of repaglinide, 1 mg before each meal, in maintaining glycaemic control in Type 2 diabetic patients who either miss a meal or have an extra meal, 25 patients were randomized to either a fixed-meal regimen of three meals/day or one of two mixed-meal regimens consisting of repeating patterns of two, three or four meals/day over a 20-day period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the 21st day each patient received three meals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall glycaemic control was assessed by weekly serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24103">fructosamine</z:chebi> concentrations and 13-point and 37-point serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24103">fructosamine</z:chebi> concentrations decreased significantly to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values during the treatment period (from 3.10 to 2.68 mg/dl on the fixed-meal regimen and from 3.37 to 2.85 mg/dl on the mixed-meal regimens; P &lt; 0.05), with no statistically significant difference in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control between the fixed-meal and mixed-meal regimen groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fasting serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels decreased slightly in both groups, but were not altered by the number of meals consumed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> profiles were not altered significantly by the number of meals consumed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Repaglinide was well tolerated, and no hypoglycaemic events were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serum cholesterol levels were significantly reduced (P &lt; 0.05) in both the fixed-meal and mixed-meal groups, as were <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels in the mixed-meal group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that meal-associated treatment with repaglinide was well tolerated irrespective of the number of meals consumed/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, since missing or postponing a meal is a realistic scenario for many individuals, repaglinide offers an oral anti-diabetic treatment which can be adjusted to suit each individual's lifestyle </plain></SENT>
