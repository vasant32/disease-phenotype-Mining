<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, mechanisms that contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011998'>postprandial hyperglycemia</z:hpo> have not been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study showed that mice with targeted inactivation of the group 1B phospholipase A2 (Pla2g1b) gene displayed lower postprandial glycemia than that observed in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice after being fed a <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-rich meal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The difference was caused by enhanced postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake by the liver, heart, and muscle tissues as well as altered postprandial hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in the Pla2g1b-/- mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These differences were attributed to a fivefold decrease in the amount of dietary <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> absorbed as lysophospholipids in Pla2g1b-/- mice compared with that observed in Pla2g1b+/+ mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Elevating plasma lysophospholipid levels in Pla2g1b-/- mice via intraperitoneal injection resulted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> similar to that exhibited by Pla2g1b+/+ mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Studies with cultured <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019204" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatoma</z:e> cells revealed that lysophospholipids dose-dependently suppressed insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrated that reduction of lysophospholipid absorption enhances insulin-mediated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism and is protective against <z:hpo ids='HP_0011998'>postprandial hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
