<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: From a community-based cohort, 495 Europid (i.e., of European descent) patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who had no history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary disease</z:e> underwent baseline spirometry between 1993 and 1994 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A subset of 125 patients was restudied a mean of 7.0 years later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The main outcome measures included forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), vital capacity (VC), and peak expiratory flow (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="55310">PEF</z:chebi>) corrected for body temperature, air pressure, and water saturation and were expressed either in absolute terms or as percentage-predicted value for age, sex, and height </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean percentage-predicted values of each spirometric measure were decreased &gt;10% in the whole cohort at baseline and absolute measures continued to decline at an annual rate of 68, 71, and 84 ml/year and 17 l/min for FVC, FEV1, VC, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="55310">PEF</z:chebi>, respectively, in the 125 prospectively studied patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Declining lung function measures were consistently predicted by poor glycemic control in the form of a higher updated mean HbA1c, follow-up HbA1c, or follow-up fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a Cox proportional hazards model, decreased FEV1 percentage-predicted value was an independent predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Reduced lung volumes and airflow limitation are likely to be <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> complications of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the severity of which relates to glycemic exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Airflow limitation is a predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after adjusting for other recognized risk factors </plain></SENT>
