<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is not clear whether young people of different ethnic backgrounds differ in their adaptive mechanisms to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the early insulin response and insulin clearance in response to an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> load in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> children and adolescents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seven hundred and nine <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> children and adolescents underwent an OGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Indices of the early insulin response and insulin clearance were compared in participants of White European, African American and Hispanic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Participants of the three ethnic groups demonstrated similar mechanisms of adaptation to increasing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, but with different magnitudes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>African American subjects had a greater early insulin response and decreased insulin clearance than their White European and Hispanic counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This happened regardless of whether the cohort was divided by <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance level or by level of insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IGT across ethnic groups was characterised by a marked decline in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin response in the context of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and very low insulin clearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> children and adolescents, mechanisms of adaptation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> are similar across ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The greater early insulin response needed to maintain <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance in young people of ethnic minorities may partially explain their greater tendency to develop type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
