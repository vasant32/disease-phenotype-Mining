<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 60 men (mean age 60.5 +/- 1.2 years) had a detailed hormonal and metabolic evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity was measured using a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>Mitochondrial</z:hpo> function was assessed by measuring maximal aerobic capacity (V(O2max)) and expression of oxidative phosphorylation genes in skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 45% of subjects had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, 20% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo>, and 35% had type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">Testosterone</z:chebi> levels were positively correlated with insulin sensitivity (r = 0.4, P &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subjects with hypogonadal <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> levels (n = 10) had a BMI &gt;25 kg/m(2) and a threefold higher prevalence of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> than their eugonadal counterparts (n = 50); this relationship held true after adjusting for age and <z:chebi fb="25" ids="50112">sex hormone</z:chebi>-binding globulin but not BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">Testosterone</z:chebi> levels also correlated with V(O2max) (r = 0.43, P &lt; 0.05) and oxidative phosphorylation gene expression (r = 0.57, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that low serum <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> levels are associated with an adverse metabolic profile and suggest a novel unifying mechanism for the previously independent observations that low <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> levels and impaired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> function promote <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in men </plain></SENT>
