<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In animal models, colonic administration of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> can stimulate GLP-1 and PYY by TGR5 receptor activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28865">taurocholic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi>), administered as an enema, on plasma GLP-1 and PYY, as well as gastrointestinal sensations in 10 healthy male subjects, and observed that rectal administration of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi> promptly stimulated secretion of both GLP-1 and PYY, and increased fullness, in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These observations confirm that topical application of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> to the distal gut may have potential for the management of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
