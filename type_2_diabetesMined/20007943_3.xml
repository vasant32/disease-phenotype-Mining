<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the longitudinal association of components of health-related functioning (HRF) with incident impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The Australian <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> and Lifestyle (AusDiab) study is a national, longitudinal study of adults aged &gt; or =25 years from 42 randomly selected areas of Australia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> status was defined using the World Health Organization criteria, and HRF was assessed using the SF-36 questionnaire in 1999-2000 and 2004-2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Incident impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (IFG), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT), and newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were associated with increased bodily pain at baseline compared with those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (NGT) (IFG P = 0.005, IGT P &lt; 0.004, and newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> P = 0.005), after adjustment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, those with incident IGT and newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had significantly reduced physical functioning, general health, mental health, and vitality at baseline compared with those with NGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After we controlled for factors associated with incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, those in the lowest quartile of the physical component summary scale at baseline had at least a 50% higher risk of progression to impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> 5 years later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that incident IFG, IGT, and newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are associated with reduced HRF independent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> and that this is evident before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of these conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>If future health promotion campaigns are to effectively target those at high risk of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, an understanding of the process of declining health before <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the disease is essential </plain></SENT>
