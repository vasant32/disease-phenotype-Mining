<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Prior to the intervention, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants received 6 months of mailed DSME consisting of weekly educational newsletters coupled with clinical feedback </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The intervention consisted of 88 weekly group-based sessions that participants were encouraged to attend as frequently as they needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sessions were guided by participants' self-management questions and also emphasized experiential learning, coping, goal-setting, and problem-solving </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Baseline, 6-month, and 30-month assessments measured A1C, weight, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, self-care behaviors, and QOL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: This report is based on 60 African-American adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n=89 recruited at baseline) who completed the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Post 6-month DSME, participants demonstrated significant improvements for diastolic BP (p&lt;0.05), serum cholesterol (p&lt;0.001), healthy diet (p&lt;0.01), blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring (p&lt;0.05) and foot exams (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Post 24-month intervention, participants sustained the improvements achieved from the 6-month DSME and reported additional improvements for healthy diet (p&lt;0.05), carbohydrate spacing (p&lt;0.01), insulin use (p&lt;0.05), and quality of life (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that an empowerment-based DSMS model can sustain or improve <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related health gains achieved from previous short-term DSME </plain></SENT>
