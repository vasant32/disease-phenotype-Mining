<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Definitive studies of the effectiveness of screening for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are currently not available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RCTs would be the best means to assess effectiveness, but several barriers prevent these studies from being conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prospective observational studies may characterize some of the benefits of screening by creating screened and unscreened groups for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The availability of better data systems and health services research techniques will facilitate such comparisons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, the interpretation of the results of such studies is extremely problematic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Several screening tests have been evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Risk assessment questionnaires have generally performed poorly as stand-alone tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Screening with biochemical tests performs better </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Venous and capillary <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> measurements may perform more favorably than urinary <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> or HbA(1c) measurements, and measuring postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels may have advantages over measuring fasting levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, performance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> screening tests is dependent on the cutoff point selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, there are no well-defined and validated cutoff points to define positive tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A two-stage screening test strategy may assist with a more efficient use of resources, although such approaches have not been rigorously tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The optimal interval for screening is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Even though periodic, targeted, and opportunistic screening within the existing health care system seems to offer the greatest yield and likelihood of appropriate follow-up and treatment, much of the reported experience with screening appears to be episodic poorly targeted community screening outside of the existing health care system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Statistical models have helped to answer some of the key questions concerning areas in which there is lack of empirical data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Current models need to be refined with new clinical and epidemiological information, such as the UKPDS results (200) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In addition, future models need to include better information on the natural history of the preclinical phase of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Data from ongoing clinical trials of screening and treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo>, such as the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Prevention Program, may eventually offer more direct evidence for early detection and treatment of asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> (201) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>It will be important to use comprehensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> modules that assess the conjoint influence of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factor</z:e> reduction, information on QOL, and refined economic evaluations using common outcome measures (cost per life-year or QALY gained) (11,178,202-204) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Such studies should consider <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the costs associated with a comprehensive screening program, including, at a minimum, the direct costs of screening, diagnostic testing, and care for patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> detected through screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Finally, combinations of screening tests and different screening intervals should be evaluated within economic studies to allow selection of the optimal approach within the financial and resource limitations of the health care system </plain></SENT>
