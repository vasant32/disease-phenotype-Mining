<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> to cognitive function in community-dwelling women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: From 1995 to 1999, we administered four tests of cognitive function (Telephone Interview of Cognitive Status [TICS], immediate and delayed recall of the East Boston Memory Test, and verbal fluency) by telephone to 2,374 participants (70-78 years of age) of the Nurses' Health Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Information on <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was collected biennially beginning in 1976; 82 women reported type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> before their cognitive testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used linear and logistic regression models to calculate multivariate-adjusted mean differences in scores and relative risks of a low score (bottom 10% of the distribution) for diabetic women compared with nondiabetic women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After multivariate adjustment, women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> scored lower on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> our cognitive tests than women without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the general test of cognition (TICS), the mean difference in score between women with and without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was -0.60 (95% CI -1.18 to -0.03, P = 0.04) and the relative risk of a low TICS score was 1.98 (95% CI 1.06 to 3.69) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On a global score combining results of the four tests, the mean for diabetic women was lower than that among women without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (adjusted difference in score -0.73, 95% CI -1.42 to -0.04, P = 0.04), and the relative risk of a low global score was 2.16 (95% CI 1.10 to 4.21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Relative to women without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, longer duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was associated with lower scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Few diabetic women were pharmacologically treated (n = 31), but those taking medication had scores similar to those of women without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In these women, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was related to lower scores on several aspects of cognitive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Longer duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may be associated with poorer scores, but hypoglycemic therapy may ameliorate scores </plain></SENT>
