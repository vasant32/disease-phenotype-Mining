<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the utility of a point-of-care (POC) capillary blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> measurement as compared with routine clinical parameters in predicting undiagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a low-resource rural India setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Nine hundred and ninety-four participants aged &gt;30 years and stratified by age and sex were randomly selected from 20 villages in India </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A clinical questionnaire, sampling for laboratory venous fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG), and POC capillary blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> assay were performed simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> diagnosis was based on the World Health Organization (WHO) definition using FPG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The capacity of the POC <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> to predict the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was assessed and compared with the questionnaire using area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The AUC for POC <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> alone in predicting <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 0.869 (95% CI 0.810-0.929) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was significantly better (P &lt; 0.001 for AUC comparison) than the models based upon clinical variables alone (AUC for the best clinical model including age, BMI, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, waist circumference: 0.694 [95% CI 0.621-0.766]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>POC <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> appropriately reclassified the risk of up to one-third of participants ranked according to the clinical models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adding the clinical variables to the POC <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> assay did not significantly improve the discriminatory capability beyond that achieved with the POC <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> measurement alone (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &gt; 0.37) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: POC <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> testing appears to be a simple and reliable tool for identifying undiagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a high-risk, resource-poor rural population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, studies evaluating the cost effectiveness of introducing POC <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> testing are needed prior to widespread implementation </plain></SENT>
