<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted two prospective case-control studies nested in the Women's Health Study (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WHS</z:e>) and Physicians' Health Study II (PHS II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WHS</z:e>, during a median of 10-years of follow-up, 359 postmenopausal women, who were apparently healthy at baseline and later developed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, were prospectively matched with 359 healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the PHS II, with 8 years of total follow-up, 170 men, who were apparently healthy at baseline and later developed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, were matched with 170 healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Control subjects were matched by age, race, and time of blood draw </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Resistin levels at baseline were significantly higher in women than in men (P = 0.003) and in case patients than in control subjects for both women (P &lt; 0.001) and men (P = 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for matching factors, physical activity, alcohol intake, smoking, and family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the relative risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> comparing the highest to the lowest quartile of resistin in women was 2.22 ([95% CI 1.32-3.73]; Ptrend = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This association was attenuated after further adjustment for BMI (1.51 [0.86-2.65]; Ptrend = 0.20) or C-reactive protein (1.18 [0.68-2.07]; Ptrend = 0.60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A similar but weaker pattern was observed in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Elevated levels of circulating resistin were significantly related to increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, which appears to be partially accounted for by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> and the inflammatory process </plain></SENT>
