<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Ten healthy, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-tolerant but insulin-resistant probands were subjected to a placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each individual received infusions of either 0.15 mol/l saline or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> in randomized order on two separate occasions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A three-step hyperinsulinemic (0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 mU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>kg(-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>min(-1))-euglycemic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> clamp was performed on both occasions to determine insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">Glimepiride</z:chebi>-induced insulin secretion was inhibited by octreotide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Endogenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> elimination were measured with the "hot" <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion method using U-[(13)C]<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> as tracer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> oxidation was determined from indirect calorimetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Lipolysis was evaluated by measurements of nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> concentration and measurement of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin concentrations were not significantly different between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> or saline infusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was a significant increase in the rate of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion necessary to maintain euglycemia during infusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> during the low- (12.2 +/- 1.1 vs. 16.1 +/- 1.7 micro mol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>kg(-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>min(-1)) and intermediate-dose insulin infusion (24.4 +/- 1.7 vs. 30.0 +/- 2.8 micro mol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>kg(-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>min(-1)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This was explained by an increased rate of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> elimination and to a lesser degree by a decrease in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> oxidation rate was not different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>NEFA and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> concentration and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> production were equally suppressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">Glimepiride</z:chebi> improves peripheral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake and decreases endogenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production independent of its insulin secretagogue action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The effects shown in this <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> study are, however, too small to be considered therapeutically beneficial for the individual patient </plain></SENT>
