<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated the long-term effects of the GLP-1RA exenatide on pancreatic exocrine structure and function in the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> diabetic fatty (ZDF) rat model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats received subcutaneous twice-daily injections of 0 (control), 6, 40 and 250 µg/kg/day exenatide for 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical signs, body and pancreas weight, food consumption, HbA1c, fasting serum amylase, lipase, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin concentrations were evaluated during treatment and after a 28-day off-drug period to assess the reversibility of any observed effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Morphometric analysis of pancreatic ductal cell proliferation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Plasma exenatide concentrations were several-fold higher than therapeutic levels observed in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No exenatide-related effects were observed on clinical signs, lipase concentration, pancreatic weight, pancreatic histology, ductal cell proliferation or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Exenatide improved animal survival, physical condition, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations and HbA1c, decreased food intake, and increased serum insulin concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Total amylase concentrations, although within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ranges, were slightly higher in exenatide-treated rats; following the off-drug period, total amylase concentrations were comparable in treated and untreated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Exenatide-related minimal-to-moderate islet <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> was observed at doses ≥6 µg/kg/day, with dose-related increases in incidence and degree </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These changes were still present after the off-drug period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> administration of exenatide in ZDF rats resulted in the expected metabolic benefits and improved animal survival, with no adverse effects noted on pancreatic exocrine structure and function </plain></SENT>
