<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This new retrospective study design used data from physicians in a restricted manner (retrolective) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data from case report forms from 520 patients from 91 randomly selected centres were assessed and covariance analysis performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The influence of practice and patient characteristics on treatment assignment was low, reflecting the design of randomised controlled trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and reduction in body mass index from baseline to study endpoint were greater with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> than with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> (-2.04+/-3.99 kg vs -0.58+/-3.65 kg, p&lt;0.001; -0.71+/-1.38 kg/m(2) vs -0.20+/-1.28 kg/m(2), p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> led to decreases in fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (-2.43+/-0.24 mmol/l vs -3.03+/-0.24 mmol/l; p&lt;0.001 vs baseline) and HbA(1c) (-1.23+/-0.09% vs -1.26+/-0.09%; p&lt;0.001 vs baseline) </plain></SENT>
