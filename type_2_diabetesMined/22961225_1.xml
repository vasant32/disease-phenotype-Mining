<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The underlying molecular mechanisms could involve epigenetics, as recent data show altered DNA methylation of putative type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> candidate genes in response to high-fat diets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the effect of a short-term high-fat overfeeding (HFO) diet on genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in human skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Skeletal muscle biopsies were obtained from 21 healthy young men after ingestion of a short-term HFO diet and a control diet, in a randomised crossover setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DNA methylation was measured in 27,578 CpG sites/14,475 genes using Illumina's Infinium Bead Array </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Candidate gene expression was determined by quantitative real-time PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HFO introduced widespread DNA methylation changes affecting 6,508 genes (45%), with a maximum methylation change of 13.0 percentage points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The HFO-induced methylation changes were only partly and non-significantly reversed after 6-8Â weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Alterations in DNA methylation levels primarily affected genes involved in <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, the reproductive system and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Few gene expression changes were observed and these had poor correlation to DNA methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The genome-wide DNA methylation changes induced by the short-term HFO diet could have implications for our understanding of transient epigenetic regulation in humans and its contribution to the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The slow reversibility suggests a methylation build-up with HFO, which over time may influence gene expression levels </plain></SENT>
