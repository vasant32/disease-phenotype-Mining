<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the hospital care rendered to hyperglycemic individuals who did not have a diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> before admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 1,034 consecutively hospitalized adult patients at a 750-bed inner-city teaching hospital were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with one or more plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> values &gt; 200 mg/dl were identified by the laboratory data system on a daily basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients without a diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at the time of admission were evaluated to determine if and how physicians addressed the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, whether a new diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was made during admission, and whether follow-up was planned to address the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After excluding patients who were admitted for a primary diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 37.5% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> hyperglycemic medical patients and 33% of hyperglycemic surgical patients were without a diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at the time of admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These patients had a mean peak <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> of 299 mg/dl, and 66% had two or more elevated values during their hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifty-four percent received insulin therapy, and 59% received bedside <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring, yet 66% of daily patient progress notes failed to comment on the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> was documented in only three patients (7.3%) as a possible diagnosis in the daily progress notes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, most medical records made no reference to the possibility of unrecognized <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Given the average delay of a decade between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and diagnosis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, further evaluation of hyperglycemic hospitalized patients may present an important opportunity for earlier detection and the initiation of therapy </plain></SENT>
