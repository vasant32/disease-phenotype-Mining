<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The etiology of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> often involves diet-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (DIO), which is associated with elevated plasma fatty acids and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> associated <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since aberrant hepatic fatty acid uptake may contribute to this, we investigated whether increased expression of a fatty acid transport protein (CD36) in the liver during DIO contributes to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> that precedes development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We determined the effect DIO has on hepatic CD36 protein expression and the functional consequence of this in terms of hepatic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> storage and secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, in vivo adenoviral gene delivery of CD36 to the livers of lean mice was performed to determine if increased hepatic CD36 protein was sufficient to alter hepatic fatty acid uptake and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> storage and secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During DIO, CD36 protein levels in the liver are significantly elevated, and these elevated levels correlate with increased hepatic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> storage and secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These alterations in liver <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> storage and secretion were also observed upon forced expression of hepatic CD36 in the absence of DIO and were accompanied with a marked rise in hepatic fatty acid uptake in vivo, demonstrating that increased CD36 expression is sufficient to recapitulate the aberrant liver <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> handling observed in DIO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Increased expression of hepatic CD36 protein in response to DIO is sufficient to exacerbate hepatic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> storage and secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As these CD36-mediated effects contribute to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> that often precedes the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, increased hepatic CD36 expression likely plays a causative role in the pathogenesis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
