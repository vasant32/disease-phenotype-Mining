<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We prospectively examined the relationship between lung function and risk of type-2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and fatal and nonfatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> (CHD) events and investigated the hypothesis that <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> may underlie these associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A prospective study of 4,434 men aged 40-59 years with no history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (CHD or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) or <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> drawn from general practices in 24 British towns and followed up for 20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 680 major CHD events (276 fatal, 404 nonfatal) and 256 incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during the 20 years follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) but not FEV(1)-to-FVC ratio were significantly and inversely associated with incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and fatal CHD events (not nonfatal events) after adjustment for age, potential confounders, and metabolic risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The adjusted relative risk (RR) for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (Quartile 1 vs. Quartile 4) were 1.59 (1.07-2.56) and 1.74 (1.16-2.61) for FVC and FEV(1), respectively (P = 0.03 and P = 0.04 for trend) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The corresponding RR for fatal CHD were 1.48 (1.00-2.21) and 1.81 (1.19-2.76) (P = 0.002 and P = 0.0003 for trend) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lung function was significantly and inversely associated with C-reactive protein and interleukin-6; the inverse associations with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for FVC and FEV(1) were attenuated after further adjustment for these factors (P = 0.14 and P = 0.11 for trend) but remained significant for fatal CHD (P = 0.03 and P = 0.01, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Restrictive rather than obstructive impairment of lung function is associated with incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (and fatal CHD) with both associations partially explained by traditional and metabolic risk factors and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
