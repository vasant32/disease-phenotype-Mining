<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To assess whether resistance to the effects of insulin on <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism in type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> parallels that demonstrated for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirteen patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were studied (mean age 56.2 years, mean body mass index (b.m.i.) 28.7 kg m(-2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp (2 mU insulin kg(-1) min(-1)) and a low-dose insulin infusion technique were used in order to assess insulin effects on both <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Using the low-dose insulin infusion there were significant correlations between measures of insulin sensitivity for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism and those for NEFA (r = 0.82, p &lt; 0.01) and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> (r = 0.73, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean clamp <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal was 33.4 micromol kgb.w.(-1) min(-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between clamp <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal and insulin sensitivity derived from the low-dose insulin infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: At low insulin concentrations, insulin's effects on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism (mainly suppression of hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> output) mirror those on inhibition of lipolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the high insulin concentrations seen during the clamp, stimulation of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake provides a measure of maximal insulin action which does not parallel its physiological effects shown at lower concentrations </plain></SENT>
