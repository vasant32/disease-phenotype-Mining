<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (13 males, 10 females) were studied, and none of these patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> and overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
