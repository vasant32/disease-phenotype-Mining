<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The 9-year incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was studied in 979 men and women with baseline IFG, from the Data from an Epidemiological Study on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin Resistance</z:hpo> Syndrome (DESIR) cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Increases in both waist circumference and weight were significantly associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Standardized odds ratios (95% CI) were 1.79 (1.45-2.21) and 1.86 (1.51-2.30), respectively, after controlling for baseline risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The impact of waist circumference increase was greater for BMI &lt;25 kg/m(2) (2.40 [1.63-3.52]) than for BMI &gt;or=25 kg/m(2) (1.66 [1.28-2.16]) and persisted after adjusting for concurrent changes in either insulinemia or the homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Weight change had a similar impact in both BMI groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In individuals with IFG, it is important to monitor and prevent increases in waist circumference, in particular for those with BMI &lt;25 kg/m(2) </plain></SENT>
