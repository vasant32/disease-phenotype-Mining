<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The data used in the present analyses are from a 104-week study, which included a 24-week, placebo- and active controlled phase followed by a 30-week, active controlled, continuation phase and an additional 50-week, active controlled extension phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomised to one of six blinded treatments: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> 50 mg + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> 1000 mg b.i.d., <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> 50 mg + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> 500 mg b.i.d., <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> 1000 mg b.i.d., <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> 500 mg b.i.d., <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> 100 mg q.d. or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients on placebo were switched in a blinded manner to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> 1000 mg b.i.d. at week 24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsets of patients volunteered to undergo frequently sampled meal tolerance tests at baseline and at weeks 24, 54 and 104. β-cell responsivity was assessed with the C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> minimal model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The static component (Φ(s)) estimates the rate of insulin secretion related to above-basal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The dynamic component (Φ(d)) is related to the rate of change in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The total index (Φ(total)) represents the overall response to a glycaemic stimulus and is calculated as a function of Φ(s) and Φ(d) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity was estimated with the Matsuda index (ISI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The disposition index, which assesses insulin secretion relative to the prevailing insulin sensitivity, was calculated based on the Φ(total) and ISI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At week 24, substantial reductions in postmeal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> were observed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> active treatment groups relative to the placebo group. Φ(s), Φ(total) and the disposition index were significantly improved from baseline at week 24 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> active treatments relative to placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Generally larger effects were observed with the initial combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> relative to the monotherapy groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>When expressed as median percent change from baseline, Φ(s) increased from baseline by 137 and 177% in the low- and high-dose combination groups and by 85, 54, 73 and -9% in the high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> monotherapy and placebo groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>At weeks 54 and 104, the combination treatment groups continued to demonstrate greater improvements in β-cell function relative to their respective monotherapy groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: After 24 weeks of therapy, relative to placebo, initial treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy improved β-cell function; moreover, initial combination therapy demonstrated larger improvements than the individual monotherapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Improvements in β-cell function were found with treatments for up to 2 years </plain></SENT>
