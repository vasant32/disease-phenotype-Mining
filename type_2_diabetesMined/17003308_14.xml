<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: After the demonstration that one-third of male patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have <z:hpo ids='HP_0000044'>hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism</z:hpo>, we have shown that patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000044'>hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism</z:hpo> also have markedly elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have now hypothesized that type 2 diabetic subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000044'>hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism</z:hpo> may have a lower hematocrit because <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> stimulates, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> suppresses, erythropoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Seventy patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at a tertiary referral center were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean hematocrit in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000044'>hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism</z:hpo> (n = 37), defined as calculated free <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> (cFT) of &lt;6.5 ng/dl, was 40.6 +/- 1.1%, whereas that in eugonadal patients (n = 33) was 43.3 +/- 0.7% (P = 0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The hematocrit was related to cFT concentration (r = 0.46; P &lt; 0.0001); it was inversely related to plasma CRP concentration (r = 0.41; P &lt; 0.0004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with CRP &lt;3 mg/l had a higher hematocrit (42.7 +/- 0.7%) than those with CRP &gt;3 mg/l (39.9 +/- 1.1%; P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of normocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001895'>normochromic anemia</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> &lt;13 g/dl) was 23% in the entire group, whereas it was 37.8% in the men with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000044'>hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism</z:hpo> and 3% in the eugonadal men (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Erythropoietin concentration was elevated or high <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 11 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> in whom it was tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000044'>hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism</z:hpo> in male type 2 diabetic subjects is associated with a lower hematocrit and a frequent occurrence of mild normocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001895'>normochromic anemia</z:hpo> with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or high erythropoietin concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In these patients, hematocrit is also inversely related to CRP concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, low <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> inflammatory mechanisms may contribute to mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Such patients may also have a high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular events in view of their markedly elevated CRP concentrations </plain></SENT>
