<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Adipose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> lipase (ATGL) was recently described to predominantly perform the initial step in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> hydrolysis and therefore seems to play a pivotal role in the lipolytic catabolism of stored fat in adipose tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the first study investigating genetic variations within the ATGL gene in humans, 12 polymorphisms identified via sequencing and database search were studied in 2,434 individuals of European ancestry from Utah </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These polymorphisms and their haplotypes were analyzed in subjects not taking <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> medication for association with plasma free fatty acids (FFAs) as primary analysis, as well as <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> as a secondary analysis (n = 1,701, 2,193, or 2,190, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 342 of 2,434) was analyzed as an outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FFA concentrations were significantly associated with several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of ATGL (P values from 0.015 to 0.00003), consistent with additive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pattern was similar when considering <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, two SNPs showed associations with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels (P &lt; 0.00001) and risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Haplotype analysis supported and extended the shown SNP association analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results complement previous findings of functional studies in mammals and elucidate a potential role of ATGL in pathways involved in components of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
