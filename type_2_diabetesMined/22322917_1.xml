<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hyperglycaemia</z:e> may compensate for these defects, but to what extent it involves improved insulin signalling to <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthesis remains to be clarified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Whole-body <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism was studied in 12 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and 10 lean and 10 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> non-diabetic controls by means of indirect calorimetry and tracers during a euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diabetic patients underwent a second isoglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp maintaining fasting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Muscle biopsies from m. vastus lateralis were obtained before and after the clamp for examination of GS and relevant insulin signalling components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During euglycaemia, insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> oxidation and non-oxidative <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism were reduced in the diabetic group compared with both control groups (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was associated with impaired insulin-stimulated GS and AKT2 activity, deficient dephosphorylation at GS sites 2 + 2a, and reduced Thr308 and Ser473 phosphorylation of AKT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When studied under <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> variables of insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism were normalised compared with the weight-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, insulin activation and dephosphorylation (site 2 + 2a) of GS as well as activation of AKT2 and phosphorylation at Thr308 and Ser473 remained impaired (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATIONS: These data confirm that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> compensates for decreased whole-body <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast to previous less well-controlled studies, we provide evidence that the compensatory effect of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> does not involve normalisation of insulin action on GS or upstream signalling in skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
