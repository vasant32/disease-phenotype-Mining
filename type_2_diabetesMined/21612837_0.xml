<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 1108 new type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> cases enrolled on the Otago <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Register had clinical data recorded at baseline and 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Means and standard deviations or percentages were calculated for variables of interest for &lt;40, 40-59, 60-79 and 80-100 year age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>p-Values for differences over time and among groups were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ordinal regression, with robust standard errors, was used to examine intensification of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> age groups blood pressure and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels approached recommended targets at 5 years (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> worsened, especially in the youngest age group (from 7.3±1.9% to 7.9±1.7%, p&lt;0.001) who had the highest odds of more intense <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treatment at 5 years: 6.2 (95% CI 3.5-11.2) compared with 3.3 (95% CI 2.7-4.1) for 40-59-year olds, 2.8 (95% CI 2.3-3.3) for 60-79-year olds and 1.4 (95% CI 0.9-2.0) for ≥80-year olds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Good management of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients, principally in primary care, can lead to improved blood pressure and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Targets for glycaemic control and weight are less readily achieved especially among young age groups </plain></SENT>
