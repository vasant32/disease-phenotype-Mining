<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) risk factors among recently diagnosed youth with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and nondiabetic youth and investigate whether demographic, behavioral, or metabolic factors might account for observed differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data from 106 type 2 diabetic and 189 nondiabetic multiethnic youth, aged 10-22 years, were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk factors were age and race/ethnicity adjusted using direct standardization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multiple linear regression models were sequentially adjusted for demographic, behavioral (dietary saturated fat intake and physical activity), and metabolic (body <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> and glycemia) factors to explore possible mechanisms associated with differences in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk factors between the case and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with control subjects, youth with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had a higher prevalence of elevated blood pressure, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, large waist circumference, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003233'>low HDL cholesterol</z:hpo>, high <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, and high albumin-to-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio (P &lt; 0.05 for each risk factor) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Type 2 diabetic youth also had higher levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B, fibrinogen, interleukin (IL)-6, C-reactive protein, and leptin; lower adiponectin levels; and denser <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> particles (P &lt; 0.05 for each risk factor) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adjustment for BMI, waist circumference, and A1C substantially attenuated differences in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk factors between the case/control groups, except for fibrinogen and IL-6, which remained significantly higher in type 2 diabetic youth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Compared with control youth, type 2 diabetic youth have a less favorable <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk factor profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Adiposity</z:e> and glycemia are important contributors to differences in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk profiles among type 2 diabetic and control youth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Inflammatory and prothrombotic factors may also play an important role </plain></SENT>
