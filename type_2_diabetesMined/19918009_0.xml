<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether multiparity is associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, independent of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and adipokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Participants were from the University of California San Diego Filipino Women's Health Study with at least one live birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 2-h 75-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test was administered; adiponectin, leptin, ghrelin, reproductive history, family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, VAT, and lifestyle behaviors were measured between 1995 and 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 152 women, mean age was 59.5 years (range 48-73 years) and mean parity was 4.3 (range 1-12 births) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevalence increased by parity group (low parity, 1-2 births, 25%; medium parity, 3-5 births, 30.3%; and grand multiparity: 6-12 births, 50%; P = 0.048) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, exercise, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, and leptin and ghrelin levels did not differ by parity group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with women in the low parity group, women with &gt; or =6 births were significantly older (62 vs. 57 years), had lower college completion (22 vs. 58%, P = 0.006), more <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (72 vs. 55%), higher VAT (74.9 vs. 58.4 cm(3)), and lower adiponectin concentration (5.79 vs. 7.61 microg/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis adjusting for adiponectin, VAT, family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, age, education, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> use, grand multiparous women had a threefold higher odds of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (adjusted odds ratio 3.40 [95% CI 1.13-10.2]) compared with low parity women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No differences were observed in the odds of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> between women in the medium (1.10 [0.41-2.91]) and low parity groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Having &gt; or =6 children was associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, independent of adiponectin, VAT, family history, and other measured <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk factors </plain></SENT>
