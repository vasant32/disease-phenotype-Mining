<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have yielded conflicting results on the association of adiponectin levels and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Low systemic concentrations of adiponectin, as well as elevated levels of immune mediators, represent risk factors for the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The major aim of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the interdependence of hypoadiponectinemia and low-grade systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study sample consisted of 606 participants aged 55-74 years (244 with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, 242 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo>, and 120 with newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) of the population-based KORA S4 (Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg Survey 4; 1999-2001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Systemic concentrations of adiponectin and a wide range of anthropometric, metabolic, and inflammatory variables were available for analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The association of adiponectin with 15 immunological markers, including leukocyte count, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase proteins, cytokines, cytokine receptors, and chemokines, was assessed using univariable and multivariable models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No evidence for a significant correlation between adiponectin and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> immunological parameters except eotaxin could be found after multivariable adjustments, whereas multiple strong correlations with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and metabolic factors were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: From these data, we conclude that hypoadiponectinemia and a proinflammatory state are largely independent from each other </plain></SENT>
