<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Linkage studies have mapped a susceptibility gene for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> to the long arm of chromosome 10, where we have previously identified a quantitative trait locus that affects fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> within the Framingham Heart Study cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One candidate gene in this region is the insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), which, in the GK rat model, has been associated with nonobese type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were used to map a haplotype block in the 3' end of IDE, which revealed association with HbA(1c), fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG), and mean fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (mFPG) measured over 20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The strongest associations were found in a sample of unrelated men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The lowest trait values were associated with a haplotype (TT, f approximately 0.32) containing the minor allele of rs2209772 and the major allele of the rs1887922 SNP (FPG P &lt; 0.001, mFPG P &lt; 0.003, HbA(1c) P &lt; 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Another haplotype (CC, f approximately 0.16) was associated with elevated HbA(1c) (P &lt; 0.002) and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P &lt; 0.001, odds ratio 1.96, 95% CI 1.28-3.00) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The evidence presented supports the possibility that IDE is a susceptibility gene for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in populations of European descent </plain></SENT>
