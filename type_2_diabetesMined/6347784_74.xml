<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The whole pancreas was studied to take into consideration the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> distribution of the different cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From the volume density of each cell type, and the weight of each lobe of the pancreas, the total mass of <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> tissue was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It averaged 1395 mg in control subjects, 413 mg in Type 1 and 1449 mg in Type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The loss of <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> tissue observed in the Type 1 patients was almost restricted to the lobe poor in pancreatic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In these patients, B cells were practically absent (at the most seven per section), but the 'atrophic islets' still contained numerous A, D, or pancreatic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mass of A, D and pancreatic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> cells and the ratio of D to A cells were not different from those measured in the control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This shows that the disappearance of B cells in Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> has no preferential effect on any other <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> cell of the pancreas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the mass of A cells was increased, whereas that of B, D and pancreatic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> cells was not changed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> of A cells leads to a decrease in the ratio of B to A and of D to A cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These alterations may enlighten certain aspects of the physiopathology of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
