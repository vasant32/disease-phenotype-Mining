<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Research on functions and signalling pathways of insulin has traditionally focused on peripheral tissues such as muscle, fat and liver, while the brain was commonly believed to be insensitive to the effects of this hormone secreted by pancreatic beta cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, since the discovery some 30 years ago that insulin receptors are ubiquitously found in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system, an ever-growing research effort has conclusively shown that circulating insulin accesses the brain, which itself does not synthesise insulin, and exerts pivotal functions in central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> networks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> signal reflecting the amount of body fat, insulin provides direct negative feedback to hypothalamic nuclei that control whole-body energy and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, insulin affects distinct cognitive processes, e.g. by triggering the formation of psychological memory contents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, metabolic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009241" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive disorders</z:e> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> are associated with resistance of central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> structures to the effects of insulin, which may derive from genetic polymorphisms as well as from long-term exposure to excess amounts of circulating insulin due to peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, overcoming central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, e.g. by pharmacological interventions, appears to be an attractive strategy in the treatment and prevention of these disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Enhancement of central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> insulin signalling by administration of intranasal insulin, insulin analogues and insulin sensitisers in basic research approaches has yielded encouraging results that bode well for the successful translation of these effects into future clinical practice </plain></SENT>
