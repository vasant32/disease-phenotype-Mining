<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We here tried to replicate the previously reported association between the TRIB3 Q84R polymorphism (rs2295490) and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three samples of Europeans with fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &lt;7.0 mmol/l were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In sample 1 (n=791), the association between TRIB3 Q84R and impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> regulation (IGR; defined as impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> and/or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by OGTT) and insulin sensitivity (ISI), and its interplay with early-phase insulin secretion (i.e. disposition index [DI]) were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sample 2 (n=374) and sample 3 (n=394) were used to replicate the association with IGR and insulin sensitivity (by <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> clamp), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genotyping was performed by TaqMan allele discrimination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: R84 carriers were at higher risk of IGR: OR for the additive model 1.54, p=0.004, and 1.63, p=0.027, in samples 1 and 2, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In sample 1, both ISI (p=0.005) and DI (p=0.043) were progressively lower from QQ to QR and RR individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A 'triangulation approach' indicated that the association with IGR was mostly mediated by DI rather than by ISI changes (i.e. being the expected ORs 1.51 and 1.25, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In sample 3, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal was 38.8+/-17.7, 33.8+/-14.4, and 31.6+/-13.3 micromol min(-1)kg(-1), p=0.022, in QQ, QR and RR individuals, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our data confirm that the TRIB3 R84 variant affects <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis and suggest this effect is due to an alteration of the interplay between insulin sensitivity and secretion </plain></SENT>
