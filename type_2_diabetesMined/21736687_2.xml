<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of interest, large-scale intervention studies (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp>, Action in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Vascular Disease</z:e>-Preterax and Diamicron Modified Release Controlled Evaluation and Veterans Affairs <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Trial) comparing standard therapy versus more intensive <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering therapy failed to report beneficial impacts on macrovascular outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Consequently, it is currently under debate whether the high doses of exogenous insulin that were administered in these trials to achieve strict target <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels could be responsible for these unexpected outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, a potential role for plasma insulin levels in predicting macrovascular outcomes has emerged in patients with or without type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These observations, combined with evidence from in vitro and animal experiments, suggest that insulin might have intrinsic atherogenic effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this review, we summarize clinical trials, population-based studies as well as data emerging from basic science experiments that point towards the hypothesis that the administration of high insulin doses might not be beneficial in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and established macrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
