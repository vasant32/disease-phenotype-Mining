<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examined whether the amount or the quality (dietary glycemic index [GI], glycemic load [GL], and added sugar, fiber, and whole-grain intake) of carbohydrates during puberty is associated with risk markers of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in younger adulthood.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSThe analysis was based on 226 participants (121 girls and 105 boys) from the DONALD study with an average of five 3-day weighed dietary records (range 2-6) during puberty (girls, age 9-14 years; boys, age 10-15 years) and fasting blood samples in younger adulthood (age 18-36 years) (average duration of follow-up 12.6 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multivariable linear regression was used to analyze the associations between carbohydrate nutrition and homeostasis model assessment <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-IR) as well as the liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and Î³-glutamyltransferase (GGT) (n = 214).RESULTSA higher dietary GI was prospectively related to greater values of HOMA-IR (P(trend) = 0.03), ALT (P(trend) = 0.02), and GGT (P(trend) = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for sex, adult age, baseline BMI, and early life and socioeconomic factors as well as protein and fiber intake, predicted mean HOMA-IR values in energy-adjusted tertiles of GI were 2.37 (95% CI 2.16-2.60), 2.47 (2.26-2.71), and 2.59 (2.35-2.85) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The amount of carbohydrates, GL, and added sugar, fiber, and whole-grain intake were not related to the analyzed markers.CONCLUSIONSOur data indicate that a habitually higher dietary GI during puberty may adversely affect risk markers of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in younger adulthood </plain></SENT>
