<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this prospective study, non-diabetic men (n = 3,519) and women (n = 3,404) aged 60-79 years were followed up for 7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 169 and 128 incident cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in men and women, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BMI, WC and WHR <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> showed strong associations with incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> independent of potential confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In men, the adjusted relative risks (top vs lowest quartile) were 4.71 (95% CI 2.45-9.03) for BMI, 3.53 (95% CI 1.92-6.48) for WC and 2.76 (95% CI 1.58-4.82) for WHR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For women, the corresponding relative risks were 4.10 (95% CI 2.16-7.79), 12.18 (95% CI 4.83-30.74) and 5.61 (95% CI 2.84-11.09) for BMI, WC and WHR, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis revealed similar associations for BMI and WC in predicting <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in men (AUC = 0.726 and 0.713, respectively); WHR was the weakest predictor (AUC = 0.656) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In women, WC was a significantly stronger predictor (AUC = 0.780) than either BMI (AUC = 0.733) or WHR (AUC = 0.728; p &lt; 0.01 for both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Inclusion of both WC and BMI did not improve prediction beyond BMI alone in men or WC alone in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Optimal sensitivity and specificity for the prediction of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was observed at a WC of 100 cm in men and 92 cm in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In older men, BMI and WC yielded similar prediction of risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, whereas WC was clearly a superior predictor in older women </plain></SENT>
