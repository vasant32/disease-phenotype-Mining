<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) is increasingly used as a surrogate marker for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Its use relies on its ability to predict future clinical cardiovascular end points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This review examines the evidence linking CIMT as a surrogate marker of vascular complications in people with type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have also reviewed the various treatment strategies which have been shown to influence CIMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CIMT measurement is an effective, noninvasive tool which can assist in identifying people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who are at higher risk of developing microvascular and macrovascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It may also help to evaluate the effectiveness of various treatment strategies used to treat people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
