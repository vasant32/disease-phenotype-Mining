<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether dialysis treatment is an independent risk factor for foot ulceration in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal impairment</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study of consecutive patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and stage 4 or 5 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> (CKD) attending clinics in Manchester (U.K.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified as either receiving dialysis therapy (dialysis) or not (no dialysis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Foot assessment included diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> (DPN), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral arterial disease</z:hpo> (PAD), prior foot ulceration and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath>, and foot self-care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for prevalent foot ulceration were assessed by logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We studied 326 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and CKD (mean age 64 years; 61% male; 78% type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; 11% prevalent foot ulceration) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with no dialysis patients, dialysis patients had a higher prevalence of DPN (79 vs. 65%), PAD (64 vs. 43%), prior <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputations</z:mpath> (15 vs. 6.4%), prior foot ulceration (32 vs. 20%), and prevalent foot ulceration (21 vs. 5%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In univariate analyses, foot ulceration was related to wearing bespoke footwear (odds ratio 5.6 [95% CI 2.5-13]) dialysis treatment (5.1 [2.3-11]), prior foot ulceration (4.8 [2.3-9.8], PAD (2.8 [1.3-6.0], and years of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (1.0 [1.0-1.1], <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In multivariate logistic regression, only dialysis treatment (4.2 [1.7-10], P = 0.002) and prior foot ulceration (3.1 [1.3-7.1], P = 0.008) were associated with prevalent foot ulceration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Dialysis treatment was independently associated with foot ulceration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Guidelines should highlight dialysis as an important risk factor for foot ulceration requiring intensive foot care </plain></SENT>
