<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesised that in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> muscle <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15531">malonyl-CoA</z:chebi> (an inhibitor of fatty acid oxidation) would be elevated at baseline in comparison with control subjects and in particular during physiological <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020459" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperinsulinaemia</z:e> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, fatty acids taken up by muscle would be shunted away from oxidation and towards storage (non-oxidative disposal) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six control subjects and six subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were studied after an overnight fast and during a hyperinsulinaemic (0.5 mU kg(-1) min(-1)), hyperglycaemic clamp (with concurrent intralipid and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> infusions) designed to increase muscle <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15531">malonyl-CoA</z:chebi> and inhibit fat oxidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used stable isotope methods, femoral arterial and venous catheterisation, and performed muscle biopsies to measure <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> kinetics across the leg and muscle <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15531">malonyl-CoA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Basal muscle <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15531">malonyl-CoA</z:chebi> concentrations were similar in control and type 2 diabetic subjects and increased (p&lt;0.05) in both groups during the clamp (control, 0.14+/-0.05 to 0.24+/-0.05 pmol/mg; type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 0.09+/-0.01 to 0.20+/-0.02 pmol/mg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Basal <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> oxidation across the leg was not different between groups at baseline and decreased in both groups during the clamp (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">Palmitate</z:chebi> uptake and non-oxidative disposal were significantly greater in the type 2 diabetic subjects at baseline and during the clamp (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Contrary to our hypothesis, the dysregulation of muscle fatty acid metabolism in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is independent of muscle <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15531">malonyl-CoA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, elevated fatty acid uptake in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may be a key contributing factor to the increase in fatty acids being shunted towards storage within muscle </plain></SENT>
