<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To review the effects of monotherapy with alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (AGIs) for patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, with respect to mortality, morbidity, glycemic control, insulin levels, plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, body weight, and side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We systematically searched the Cochrane Central register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Current Contents, LILACS, databases of ongoing trials, and reference lists, and we contacted experts and manufacturers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials of at least 12 weeks' duration, AGI monotherapy compared with any intervention, and one of the following outcome measures: mortality, morbidity, GHb, blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, insulin levels, body weight, or side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two independent reviewers assessed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> abstracts, extracted <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> data, and assessed quality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We contacted <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> authors for data clarification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Continuous data were expressed as weighted mean differences and analyzed with a random-effects model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Possible influences of study characteristics and quality were assessed in sensitivity and meta-regression analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-one studies were included in the review (30 acarbose, 7 miglitol, 1 voglibose, and 3 combined), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> was limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found no evidence for an effect on mortality or morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with placebo, AGIs had a beneficial effect on GHb (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> -0.77%; miglitol -0.68%), fasting and postload blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and postload insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>With <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> dosages higher than 50 mg t.i.d., the effect on GHb was the same, but the occurrence of side effects increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">Acarbose</z:chebi> decreased the BMI by 0.17 kg/m2 (95% CI 0.08-0.26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>None of the AGIs had an effect on plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi>, AGIs seemed inferior with respect to glycemic control, but they reduced fasting and postload insulin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>For comparisons with other agents, little data were available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence for an effect on mortality or morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>AGIs have clear beneficial effects on glycemic control and postload insulin levels but not on plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>There is no need for dosages higher than 50 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> t.i.d </plain></SENT>
