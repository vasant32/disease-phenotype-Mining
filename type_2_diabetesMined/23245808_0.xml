<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DM2</z:e> is characterized by several degrees of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and relative deficiency in its secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genetic and environmental factors have been described as of major importance in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DM2</z:e> development as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, which is directly correlated with development of resistance in peripheral tissues and inflammatory state in metabolic activated adipose tissue </plain></SENT>
