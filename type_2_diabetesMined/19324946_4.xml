<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Paradoxically, South Asians have relatively low BMIs despite their high prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the association between BMI and incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> because detailed prospective cohort data on this topic in Asians are scarce </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This study was a prospective analysis of 37,091 men and women aged 45-74 years in the Singapore Chinese Health Study, using Cox regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Risk of incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> significantly increased beginning with BMIs 18.5-23.0 kg/m(2)(relative risk 2.47 [95% CI 1.75-3.48]) and continued in a monotonic fashion across the spectrum of BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results were stronger for younger than for older adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: BMIs considered lean and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in Singaporean Chinese are strongly associated with increased risk of incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This association weakened with advanced age but remained significant </plain></SENT>
