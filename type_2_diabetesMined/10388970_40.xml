<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In 1984, 2,764 male employees of an electrical company in Japan completed a self-administered questionnaire including the Zung Self-Rating <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Scale (<z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were followed for the next 8 years, and 2,380 (86%) responded to the follow-up survey in 1992 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up survey, occurrence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was diagnosed according to World Health Organization criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 41 cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were identified during the 8-year follow-up survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After controlling for other known risk factors for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, a proportional hazard analysis indicated that subjects who had moderate or severe levels of depressive symptoms (&gt; or = 48 on the <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>) at baseline had a 2.3 times higher risk of having type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at the follow-up survey than those who were not depressed (&lt; or = 39 on the <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>) (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Depressive symptoms may be associated with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
