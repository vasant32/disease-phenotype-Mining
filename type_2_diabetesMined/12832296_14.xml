<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The focus of this study was to determine whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> carbohydrate consumption contributes to or exacerbates <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The impact of consuming 50 g of rapidly absorbed carbohydrate (one half bagel and white grape juice) at breakfast was examined in 19 adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects (mean age 63 +/- 9 years, mean BMI 26.1 +/- 4.5 kg/m(2)) were tested, under fed and fasted conditions, on verbal declarative memory using both word list and paragraph recall tests (immediate and delayed [7-min] recall), Trails Test Part B as a measure of general brain function, and mood (subjectively monitoring global vigor and affect) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Under baseline (fasting) conditions, elevated blood HbA(1c) was negatively associated with immediate and delayed paragraph recall performance (R(2) = 0.30; P = 0.024) and higher fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> trended toward poorer word list recall (R(2) = 0.09; P = 0.102) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Carbohydrate ingestion influenced measures of delayed, but not immediate, recall in a time-dependent fashion (time x food) (word list, P = 0.046; paragraph, P = 0.044) such that delayed recall was improved at 15 min postingestion but was impaired at 30 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neither Trails Test scores (P = 0.17) nor mood (affect, P = 0.68 and vigor, P = 0.45) were influenced by food ingestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, poorer glycemic control is associated with lower performance on tests of declarative memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> ingestion of high glycemic index carbohydrate foods further contributes to the underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
