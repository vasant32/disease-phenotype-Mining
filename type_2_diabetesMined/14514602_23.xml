<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This prospective cohort study was conducted in 4747 nondiabetic Japanese men, aged 20-40 years at baseline, enrolled in 1985 with follow-up to June 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cardiorespiratory fitness was measured using a cycle ergometer test, and Vo(2max) was estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During a 14-year follow-up, 280 men developed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The age-adjusted relative risks of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> across quartiles of cardiorespiratory fitness (lowest to highest) were 1.0 (referent), 0.56 (95% CI 0.42-0.75), 0.35 (0.25-0.50), and 0.25 (0.17-0.37) (for trend, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After further adjustment for BMI, systolic blood pressure, family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, smoking status, and alcohol intake, the association between type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk and cardiorespiratory fitness was attenuated but remained significant (1.0, 0.78, 0.63, and 0.56, respectively; for trend, P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that a low cardiorespiratory fitness level is an important risk factor for incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among Japanese men </plain></SENT>
