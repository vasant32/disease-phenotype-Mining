<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed whether <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> including more novel factors such as markers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, activated coagulation and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> differ more between diabetic and non-diabetic women than between diabetic and non-diabetic men, and the role of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cross-sectional study of non-diabetic and diabetic men and women (n = 7,529) aged 60-79 years with no previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> who underwent an examination was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Measurements of anthropometry, blood pressure and fasting measurements of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, insulin, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and haemostatic and inflammatory markers were taken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Non-diabetic women tended to have more favourable risk factors and were less insulin resistant than non-diabetic men, but this was diminished in the diabetic state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Levels of waist circumference, BMI, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor (VWF), WBC count, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-IR), diastolic blood pressure, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi>, tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and factor VIII differed more between diabetic and non-diabetic women than between diabetic and non-diabetic men (test for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> × sex interaction p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The more adverse effect of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on these risk markers in women was associated with, and thereby largely attenuated by, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The greater adverse influence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> per se on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> and HOMA-IR and downstream blood pressure, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> and systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in women compared with men may contribute to their greater relative risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
