<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This is a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-week study in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with suboptimal metabolic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with a baseline <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c) (HbA(1c)) of 7.3 to 11.0% were randomized 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 to receive once-daily oral therapy with either PHX1149 (100, 200 or 400 mg) or placebo; patients were on a constant background therapy of either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> alone or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> plus a glitazone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treatment with 100, 200 or 400 mg of PHX1149 significantly decreased postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> area under the curve AUC(0-2 h) by approximately 20% (+0.11 +/- 0.50, -2.08 +/- 0.51, -1.73 +/- 0.49 and -1.88 +/- 0.48 mmol/l x h, respectively, for placebo and 100, 200 and 400 mg (p = 0.002, 0.008 and 0.004 vs. placebo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Postprandial AUC(0-2 h) of intact glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1, the principal mediator of the biological effects of DPP4 inhibitors, was increased by 3.90 +/- 2.83, 11.63 +/- 2.86, 16.42 +/- 2.72 and 15.75 +/- 2.71 pmol/l x h, respectively, for placebo and 100, 200 and 400 mg (p = 0.053, 0.001 and 0.002 vs. placebo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean HbA(1c) was lower in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> dose groups; the placebo-corrected change in the groups receiving 400 mg PHX1149 was -0.28% (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DPP4 inhibition on day 28 was 53, 73 and 78% at 24 h postdose in the groups receiving 100, 200 and 400 mg PHX1149, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in adverse events between PHX1149-treated and placebo subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Addition of the DPP4 inhibitor PHX1149 to a stable regimen of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> plus a glitazone in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was well tolerated and improved blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control </plain></SENT>
