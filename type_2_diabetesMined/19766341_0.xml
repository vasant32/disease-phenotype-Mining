<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Measures of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> status, depressive symptoms, and history of discussing and being treated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> were collected from 56 adults with elevated depressive symptoms accompanying <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were drawn from a larger study of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Analyses adjusted for confounders and multiple tests indicated that relative to Whites, African Americans were 6-12 times less likely to have ever: discussed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> with anyone (p=.007), discussed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> with their primary care physician (p=.008), been prescribed an antidepressant (p=.002), and they were 25 times less likely to have seen a psychiatrist (p=.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in discussing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> with clergypersons, or family members/friends </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Compared to their White counterparts, African Americans with depressive symptoms accompanying <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are unlikely to discuss <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> with healthcare professionals, be prescribed antidepressant medication, or be seen by a psychiatrist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Minority <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients' medical and psychiatric outcomes may improve if healthcare providers more actively initiate these discussions, provide culturally tailored education about the nature of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and its management, incorporate patient preferences into treatment plans, and establish relationships with persons more likely to learn about African American patient symptoms </plain></SENT>
