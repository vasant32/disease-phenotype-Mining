<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While NEFA-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> was formerly attributed to decreased glycolysis, it is likely that <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transport is the rate-limiting defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, the plant-derived sugar alcohol <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17151">xylitol</z:chebi> has been shown to have favourable metabolic effects in various animal models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, its derivative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27354">xylulose 5-phosphate</z:chebi> may prevent NEFA-induced suppression of glycolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We therefore examined whether and how <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17151">xylitol</z:chebi> might prevent NEFA-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined the ability of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17151">xylitol</z:chebi> to prevent NEFA-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sustained ~1.5-fold elevations in NEFA levels were induced with Intralipid/<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> infusions during 5 h euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp studies in 24 conscious non-diabetic Sprague-Dawley rats, with or without infusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17151">xylitol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Intralipid infusion reduced peripheral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake by ~25%, predominantly through suppression of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Co-infusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17151">xylitol</z:chebi> prevented the NEFA-induced decreases in both <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although glycolysis was increased by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17151">xylitol</z:chebi> infusion alone, there was minimal NEFA-induced suppression of glycolysis, which was not affected by co-infusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17151">xylitol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We conclude that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17151">xylitol</z:chebi> prevented NEFA-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, with favourable effects on <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthesis accompanying the improved insulin-mediated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This suggests that this <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25901">pentose</z:chebi> sweetener has beneficial insulin-sensitising effects </plain></SENT>
