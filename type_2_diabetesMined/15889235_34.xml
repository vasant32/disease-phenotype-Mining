<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A nested case-control study of 192 cases of incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 382 control subjects matched for sex and age was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects were participants in the population-based European Prospective Investigation into <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> and Nutrition (EPIC)-Potsdam Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dietary pattern score was derived using intake data on 48 food groups as exposure variables and the biomarkers HbA1c, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, C-reactive protein and adiponectin as response variables in reduced rank regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The association of the score with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk was estimated by conditional logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A high score for the identified dietary pattern was characterised by a high intake of fresh fruit and a low intake of high-caloric soft drinks, beer, red meat, poultry, processed meat, legumes and bread (excluding wholegrain bread) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subjects with high scores had high plasma concentrations of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> and adiponectin and low plasma concentrations of HbA1c and C-reactive protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After multivariate adjustment, the odds ratios for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> across increasing quintiles of the dietary pattern score were 1.0, 0.59, 0.51, 0.26 and 0.27, respectively (p = 0.0006 for trend) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: A high score for the identified dietary pattern is associated with a more favourable biomarker profile and a substantially reduced incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
