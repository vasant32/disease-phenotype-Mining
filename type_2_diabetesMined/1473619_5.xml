<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> autoantibody titres between patient groups and matched control subjects, nor within subject groups according to age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, elevated islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi>-autoantibody levels (&gt; 97th percentile of control subjects) were only detected in 1 of 30 patients aged 0-19 years and in 2 of 35 patients aged 20-39 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By contrast, insulin autoantibodies were frequently demonstrated, in particular at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> under age 20 (0-19 years: 18 of 30 patients; 20-39 years: 10 of 35 patients; p &lt; 0.01 vs matched control subjects) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> autoantibodies were not detectable in 3 insulinoma patients nor in 37 patients (aged 33-70 years) with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (vs 1 of 40 in matched control subjects) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In positive serum, adsorption onto protein A-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2511">Sepharose</z:chebi> removed islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> binding activity, hereby confirming its antibody nature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is associated with an age-dependent autoantibody reaction against insulin but not against islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
