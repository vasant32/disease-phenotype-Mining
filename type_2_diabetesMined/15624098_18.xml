<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As beta cells have a limited replication potential, this compensatory proliferation might accelerate cellular senescence and lead to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the cellular senescence of beta cells after proliferation during lipoglucotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Senescence-associated markers in beta cells were examined in nutrient-induced diabetic C57BL/6J mice that were fed a high-fat diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 4 and 12 months of the high-fat diet, intraperitoneal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests (IPGTTs) and histochemical analyses of Ki-67, p38, senescence-associated beta-galactosidase, and beta cell mass were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At 4 months, the AUC for plasma insulin levels during the IPGTT (AUC(insulin)) was higher, beta cell mass was 3.1-fold greater, and the proliferation of beta cells was 2.2-fold higher than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, at 12 months, AUC(insulin) declined, the frequency of Ki-67-positive beta cells decreased to one-third that of the control group, and the senescence-associated, beta-galactosidase-positive area increased to 4.7-fold that of the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, small amounts of p38, which is induced by <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and mediates cellular senescence, were found in beta cells from the high-fat diet group, but not in beta cells from the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the senescence-associated, beta-galactosidase-positive area in the high-fat diet group had a highly significant negative correlation with AUC(insulin) (r=-0.852, p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Beta cell senescence occurred in diet-induced type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and led to insufficient insulin release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that cellular senescence contributes to the pathogenesis of diet-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
