<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously found evidence that a common SREBF1c single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), located between exons 18c and 19c, is associated with an increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study aimed to replicate our previously reported association in a larger case-control study and to examine an additional five SREBF1c SNPs for their association with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk and plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We genotyped six SREBF1c SNPs in two case-control studies (n=1,938) and in a large cohort study (n=1,721) and tested for association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and with plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations (fasting and 120-min post-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> load), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the case-control studies, carriers of the minor allele of the previously reported SNP (rs11868035) had a significantly increased <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk (odds ratio [OR]=1.20 [95% CI 1.04-1.38], p=0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also, three other SNPs (rs2236513, rs6502618 and rs1889018), located in the 5' region, were significantly associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk (OR &gt; or =1.21, p&lt; or =0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, two SNPs (rs2236513 and rs1889018) in the 5' region were weakly (p&lt;0.09) associated with plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations in the cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rare homozygotes had increased (p&lt; or =0.05) 120-min post-load <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations compared with carriers of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Haplotype analyses showed significant (p=0.04) association with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk and confirmed the single SNP analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In summary, we replicated our previous finding and found evidence for SNPs in the 5' region of the SREBF1c gene to be associated with the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration </plain></SENT>
