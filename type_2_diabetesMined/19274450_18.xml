<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Skin autofluorescence was recently introduced as an alternative tool for cardiovascular risk assessment in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the prognostic value of skin autofluorescence for cardiovascular events in combination with the UKPDS risk engine in a cohort of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> managed in primary care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical, UKPDS risk engine and skin autofluorescence data were obtained at baseline in 2001-2002 in the type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> group (n = 973) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follow-up data concerning fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events (primary endpoint) were obtained till 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified as 'low risk' when their 10 year UKPDS risk score for fatal cardiovascular events was &lt;10%, and 'high risk' if &gt;10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Skin autofluorescence was measured non-invasively with an autofluorescence reader </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Skin autofluorescence was classified by the median (i.e. low risk &lt; median, high risk &gt; median) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidence of cardiovascular events was 119 (44 fatal, 75 non-fatal) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, skin autofluorescence, age, sex and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration were predictors for the primary endpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Addition of skin autofluorescence information to that from the UKPDS risk engine resulted in re-classification of 55 of 203 patients from the low-risk to the high-risk group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The 10 year cardiovascular event rate was higher in patients with a UKPDS score &gt;10% when skin autofluorescence was above the median (55.8% vs 38.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Skin autofluorescence provides additional information to the UKPDS risk engine which can result in risk re-classification of a substantial number of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It furthermore identifies patients who have a particularly high risk for developing cardiovascular events </plain></SENT>
