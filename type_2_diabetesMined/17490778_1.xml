<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the relationship between NT-proBNP levels and left ventricular dysfunction and urinary albumin excretion in Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study group consisted of 130 diabetic patients referred for echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were divided into four groups according to echocardiographic finding and into three groups according to urinary albumin excretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NT-proBNP levels were measured by electrochemiluminescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were significant differences in NT-proBNP levels among four groups (P=0.012), with a highly significant difference between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and other groups with left ventricular dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>NT-proBNP levels in diastolic dysfunction were significantly higher than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group (1491.1 pg/mL versus 232.3 pg/mL, P=0.01), even though there was no difference in ejection fraction (EF) (61.2+/-7.9% versus 60+/-8.4%, P=0.773) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NT-proBNP levels showed positive correlation with age (Rs=0.37, P&lt;0.001), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> (Rs=0.38, P=0.001), LVIDS (Rs=0.56, P=0.001) and LVIDD (Rs=0.34, P=0.04) and negative correlation with EF (Rs=-0.66, P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>NT-proBNP levels significantly differed among three groups according to urinary albumin excretion (P=0.031) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that NT-proBNP could be used to identify any impairment of left ventricular function in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
