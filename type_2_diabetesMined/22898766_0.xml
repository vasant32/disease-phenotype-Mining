<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The main constituent of islet amyloid is islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (IAPP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the ability of the peptidase neprilysin to cleave IAPP and prevent human IAPP-induced pancreatic beta cell toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Neprilysin and a catalytically compromised neprilysin mutant were tested for their ability to inhibit human IAPP fibrillisation and human IAPP-induced pancreatic beta cell cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Degradation of human IAPP by neprilysin was followed by HPLC, and the degradation products were identified by MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Neprilysin prevented IAPP fibrillisation by cleaving IAPP at Arg(11)-Leu(12), Leu(12)-Ala(13), Asn(14)-Phe(15), Phe(15)-Leu(16), Asn(22)-Phe(23) and Ala(25)<z:chebi fb="84" ids="32607">-Ile</z:chebi>(26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It also appears to prevent human IAPP fibrillisation through a non-catalytic interaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neprilysin protected against beta cell cytotoxicity induced by exogenously added or endogenously produced human IAPP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The data presented support a potential therapeutic role for neprilysin in preventing type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study supports the hypothesis that extracellular human IAPP contributes to human IAPP-induced beta cell cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Whether human IAPP exerts its cytotoxic effect through a totally extracellular mechanism or through a cellular reuptake mechanism is unclear at this time </plain></SENT>
