<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a phase II multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, dose-adjustment and maintenance trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After screening and a 2-week washout period, 99 patients were randomized to receive either repaglinide (n = 66) or placebo (n = 33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent 6 weeks of dose adjustment followed by 12 weeks of dose maintenance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fasting and stimulated glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA1c), plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> were measured at predetermined intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adverse events and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001988'>hypoglycemic episodes</z:hpo> were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From baseline to last visit, mean HbA1c decreased from 8.5 to 7.8% in patients treated with repaglinide and increased from 8.1 to 9.3% in patients receiving placebo, with a statistically significant difference of - 1.7% (P &lt; 0.0001) between treatment groups at the last visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> increased in patients receiving placebo and decreased in patients treated with repaglinide, with statistically significant (P &lt; 0.01) differences between groups at the last visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Concentrations of fasting and postprandial insulin and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> were lower at the last visit compared with baseline for patients treated with placebo and higher for patients treated with repaglinide, and the differences between groups were statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall, repaglinide was well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that repaglinide was safe and efficacious in lowering blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition to overall improvement in glycemic control noted with repaglinide in both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi>-treated patients and oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agent</z:chebi>-naive patients, repaglinide had a potent <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering effect in the postprandial period </plain></SENT>
