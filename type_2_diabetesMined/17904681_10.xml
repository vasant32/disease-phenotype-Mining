<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated circulating DPP-IV activity in type 2 diabetic patients in relation to GLP-1 degradation and metabolic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were collected from type 2 diabetic patients in three main categories: good glycaemic control (HbA(1c) &lt;7%, upper limit of non-diabetic range), moderate glycaemic control (HbA(1c) 7-9%) and poor glycaemic control (HbA(1c) &gt;9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Age- and sex-matched non-diabetic subjects were used as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Circulating DPP-IV activity of healthy control subjects was 22.5+/-0.7 nmol/ml/min (n=70) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the combined groups of type 2 diabetic subjects, circulating DPP-IV activity was significantly decreased at 18.1+/-0.7 nmol/ml/min (p&lt;0.001, n=54) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DPP-IV activity was negatively correlated with both <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (p&lt;0.01) and HbA(1c) (p&lt;0.01) in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, DPP-IV activity was reduced 1.2-fold (p&lt;0.01, n=25), 1.3-fold (p&lt;0.001, n=19) and 1.3-fold (p&lt;0.05, n=10) in good, moderate and poorly controlled diabetic groups, 18.7+/-1.0, 17.4+/-1.4 and 18.0+/-1.5 nmol/ml/min, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Degradation of GLP-1 by in vitro incubation with pooled plasma samples from healthy and type 2 diabetic subjects revealed decreased degradation to the inactive metabolite, GLP-1(9-36), in the diabetic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data indicate decreased DPP-IV activity and GLP-1 degradation in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DPP-IV enzyme activity appears to be depressed in response to poor glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
