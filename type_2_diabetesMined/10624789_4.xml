<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There is evidence that intracellular insulin may carry out some insulin mediated actions, including <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transport </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As intracellular insulin has never been quantitatively assessed in human cells, we evaluated its concentrations in monocytes from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects (n = 7) and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients without (n = 9) and with Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After the incubation of cells with labeled insulin for 60 min at 37 degrees C, intracellular intact insulin concentrations were measured by HPLC and expressed as pmol x 10(-6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Insulin concentrations were higher (ANOVA P &lt; 0.01) within cells from <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (115.4 +/- 26.4 pmol x 10(-6)/2 x 10(5) cells) and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> diabetic patients (93.2 +/- 36.3 pmol x 10(-6)/2 x 10(5) cells) compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells (28.5 +/- 13.1 pmol x 10(-6)/2 x 10(5) cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, after insulin was removed from the incubation medium the decrease of intracellular insulin was significantly lower (P &lt; 0.01) in cells from both <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> diabetic patients than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intracellular undissociated insulin-insulin receptor complexes on average, increased 2-fold (P &lt; 0.01) in cells from insulin resistant patients compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, in downregulated cells from <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> diabetic patients, the recycling of the internalized insulin receptor was completely disrupted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, monocytes from <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with and without Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, present increased intracellular insulin concentrations and these conditions are associated with a significant impairment of insulin receptor processing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increased intracellular insulin concentration in cells from these patients may be necessary in order to overcome <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
