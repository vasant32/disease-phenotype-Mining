<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Understanding the response of pancreatic beta cells to increased amounts of fuel and the role that altered insulin secretion plays in the development and maintenance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data indicate that the activated form of fatty acids acts as an effector molecule in stimulus-secretion coupling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> increases cytosolic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33184">long-chain acyl-CoA</z:chebi> because it increases the "switch" compound <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15531">malonyl-CoA</z:chebi> that blocks <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> beta-oxidation, thus implementing a shift from fatty acid to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> oxidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We present arguments in support of the following: (i) A source of fatty acid either exogenous or endogenous (derived by lipolysis of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>) is necessary to support <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> insulin secretion; (ii) a rapid increase of fatty acids potentiates <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated secretion by increasing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37554">fatty acyl-CoA</z:chebi> or complex <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> concentrations that act distally by modulating key enzymes such as protein kinase C or the exocytotic machinery; (iii) a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> increase of fatty acids enhances basal secretion by the same mechanism, but promotes <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and a diminished response to stimulatory <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>; (iv) agents which raise cAMP act as incretins, at least in part, by stimulating lipolysis via beta-cell hormone-sensitive lipase activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> stores can give higher rates of lipolysis and thus influence both basal and stimulated insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These points highlight the important roles of NEFA, LC-CoA, and their esterified derivatives in affecting insulin secretion in both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and pathological states </plain></SENT>
