<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because this meeting is focused on type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and its mechanisms, the discussion deals primarily with mechanisms of T-cell tolerance, since type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in both effector and initiator phases is primarily a T-cell-mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Emphasis is placed on more recently discovered mechanisms of maintaining self-tolerance (autoimmune regulator [AIRE]) and a new defect in T-cell negative selection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The emerging picture is that of a polygenic disease with various combinations of different alleles of many genes with important roles in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> immune response or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> immune responses </plain></SENT>
