<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> is a possible surrogate marker of skeletal muscle mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine whether serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> level is associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study participants were nondiabetic Japanese men (n = 8,570) aged 40-55 years at entry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was diagnosed if fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was &gt;or=126 mg/dl or if participants were taking oral hypoglycemic medication or insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the 4-year follow-up period, 877 men developed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lower serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> was associated with an increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The multiple-adjusted odds ratio for those who had serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> levels between 0.40 and 0.60 mg/dl was 1.91 (95% CI 1.44-2.54) compared with those who had levels between 0.71 and 0.80 mg/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Lower serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> increased the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
