<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of initial combination therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and inadequate glycemic control on diet and exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study, 1,091 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and A1C 7.5-11% were randomized to one of six daily treatments: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> 100 mg/metformin 1,000 mg (S100/M1000 group), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> 100 mg/metformin 2,000 mg (S100/M2000 group), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> 1,000 mg (M1000 group), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> 2,000 mg (M2000 group) (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> as divided doses administered twice daily [b.i.d.]), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> 100 mg q.d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>(S100 group), or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients who had an A1C &gt;11% or a fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> value &gt;280 mg/dl after the run-in period were not eligible to be randomized; these patients could participate in an open-label substudy and were treated with S100/M2000 for 24 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean baseline A1C was 8.8% in the randomized patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The placebo-subtracted A1C change from baseline was -2.07% (S100/M2000), -1.57% (S100/M1000), -1.30% (M2000), -0.99% (M1000), and -0.83% (S100) (P &lt; 0.001 for comparisons versus placebo and for coadministration versus respective monotherapies) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proportion of patients achieving an A1C &lt;7% and &lt;6.5% was 66 and 44%, respectively, in the S100/M2000 group (P &lt; 0.001 vs. S100 or M2000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For the open-label cohort (n = 117; baseline A1C 11.2%) treated with S100/M2000, the within-group mean A1C change from baseline was -2.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> was low (0.5-2.2%) across active treatment groups and not significantly different from that in the placebo group (0.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence of gastrointestinal adverse experiences was similar for coadministration therapies compared with their respective <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The initial combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> provided substantial and additive glycemic improvement and was generally well tolerated in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
