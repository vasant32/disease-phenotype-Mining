<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> suffer high rates of mental health problems, and this combination is associated with poor outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although effective treatments exist for both <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and mental health problems, delivering services for physical and mental health problems separately ignores their interaction and may be inefficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This systematic review sought to identify psychosocial interventions that could improve both the physical and mental health of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Studies were identified from the following databases: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Excerpta Medica (EMBASE), Psychinfo, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The review included randomized controlled trials in patients with type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who received psychosocial interventions and where both mental health and physical health outcomes were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data were extracted on study quality, the content and process of interventions, and outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighty-five eligible comparisons were identified, of which 49 reported sufficient data for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Psychosocial interventions modestly improved A1C (standardized mean difference -0.29 [95% CI -0.37 to -0.21]) and mental health outcomes (-0.16 [-0.25 to -0.07]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, there was a limited association between the effects on A1C and mental health, and no intervention characteristics predicted benefit on both outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Managing physical and mental health in long-term conditions are increasingly important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The review did not identify types of interventions that consistently provide benefits for both physical and mental health </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Developing such interventions remains an important challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The findings have implications for understanding the interaction between physical and mental health problems and for the coordination of care </plain></SENT>
