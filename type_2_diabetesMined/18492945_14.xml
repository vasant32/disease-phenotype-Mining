<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined whether similar impairment develops in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and defined the physiologic sources of impairment as well as the relationships to glycemia and systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microangiopathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted at a university-affiliated <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treatment center and outpatient <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> clinic, involving 69 nonsmoking type 2 diabetic patients without overt <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034072" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiopulmonary disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lung volume, pulmonary blood flow (Q), DL(CO), membrane diffusing capacity (measured from nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> uptake [DL(NO)]), and pulmonary capillary blood volume (V(C)) were determined at rest and exercise for comparison with those in 45 healthy nonsmokers as well as with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> reference values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In type 2 diabetic patients, peak levels of oxygen uptake, Q and DL(CO), DL(NO), and V(C) at exercise were 10-25% lower compared with those in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In nonobese patients (BMI &lt;30 kg/m(2)), reductions in DL(CO), DL(NO), and V(C) were fully explained by the lower lung volume and peak Q, but these factors did not fully explain the impairment in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients (BMI &gt;30 kg/m(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The slope of the increase in V(C) with respect to Q was reduced approximately 20% in patients regardless of BMI, consistent with impaired alveolar-capillary recruitment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Functional impairment was directly related to A1C level, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> in a sex-specific manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Alveolar microvascular reserves are reduced in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, reflecting restriction of lung volume, alveolar perfusion, and capillary recruitment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This reduction correlates with glycemic control and extrapulmonary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microangiopathy</z:e> and is aggravated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
