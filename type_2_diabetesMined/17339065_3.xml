<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent evidence obtained with the angiotensin receptor blockers has allowed the recognition by most guidelines that this class of agents constitutes the first choice to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in type 2 diabetic patients presenting with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011881" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic renal disease</z:e> at any stage of evolution, from <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> to advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This short review contains the most relevant evidence in favour of angiotensin receptor blockers, with particular emphasis on the capacities of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3347">candesartan</z:chebi> for controlling blood pressure and protecting the kidney </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and varying degrees of <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp>, treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3347">candesartan</z:chebi> 8-32mg daily was shown to reduce urinary albumin excretion (UAE) by up to 60% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When given in addition to an <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitor</z:chebi> (dual blockade), reductions in UAE of 25-35% relative to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitor</z:chebi> monotherapy have been found </plain></SENT>
