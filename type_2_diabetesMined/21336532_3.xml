<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most analyses have been adjusted for confounding factors, but few have taken into account <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> per se </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that the association of adiponectin levels with incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> differs between insulin-resistant and insulin-sensitive individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied two prospective cohorts: the Framingham Offspring Study (n = 2,023) and the Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg (KORA) S4/F4 study (n = 887) cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo> was estimated by HOMA-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-IR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used logistic regression analysis to test the association between adiponectin and incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> overall and in insulin-resistant vs insulin-sensitive individuals (defined by ≥ vs &lt;75th percentile of HOMA-IR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, Framingham's participants were 60 ± 9 years old and 56% were women; KORA's participants were 63 ± 5 years old and 49% were women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence was 5.4% over 6.5 years (n = 109) in Framingham and 10.5% over 8 years (n = 93) in KORA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Lower adiponectin levels were associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence in both cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In insulin-resistant individuals, lower adiponectin levels were associated with higher risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence (OR 1.60 [95% CI 1.10-2.31] per SD decrease in Framingham, p = 0.01; and OR 2.34 [95% CI 1.16-4.73] in KORA, p = 0.02); while this was not observed in insulin-sensitive individuals (OR 1.10 [95% CI 0.73-1.67] in Framingham, p = 0.64; and OR 1.34 [95%CI: 0.88-2.03] in KORA, p = 0.18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We conclude that lower adiponectin levels are associated with higher risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in insulin-resistant but not in insulin-sensitive individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This suggests that some level of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> is needed to see deleterious effects of low adiponectin </plain></SENT>
