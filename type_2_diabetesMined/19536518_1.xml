<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: It is recommended that patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> reduce their intake of saturated fat and increase their intake of monounsaturated fat or carbohydrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, high-carbohydrate diets may result in higher <z:chebi fb="4" ids="26607">saturated fatty acids</z:chebi> in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47776">VLDL-triacylglycerol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is attributed to de novo lipogenesis, although synthesis of specific fatty acids is rarely measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to examine the contribution of de novo fatty acid synthesis to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47776">VLDL-triacylglycerol</z:chebi> composition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was hypothesised that levels of total and de novo synthesised fatty acids would increase with increased carbohydrate intake in diabetic participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seven individuals with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and seven matched non-diabetic controls consumed two diets differing in fat energy (lower fat &lt;25%, higher fat &gt;35%) for 3 days in a randomised crossover design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were drawn before and 24 h after the ingestion of (2)H-labelled water </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the control participants, the higher-fat diet resulted in a 40% reduction in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47776">VLDL-triacylglycerol</z:chebi> fatty acids because of decreases in myristic, palmitic, palmitoleic and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17351">linoleic acids</z:chebi>, but the opposite trend occurred in participants with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The lower-fat diet increased the fractional synthesis rate by 35% and 25% in the control and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> participants, respectively (range: 0-33%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">Palmitate</z:chebi> accounted for 71% of fatty acids synthesised (range: 44-84% total de novo synthesised fatty acids) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: (2)H incorporation was used for the first time in humans showing variability in the synthesis rate of specific fatty acids, even <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15756">palmitic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A lower-fat diet stimulated <z:chebi fb="4" ids="26607">saturated fatty acid</z:chebi> synthesis at high rates, but no net stimulation of synthesis of any fatty acid occurred in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The implications of this finding for our understanding of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> require further investigation </plain></SENT>
