<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The fasting fatty acid pattern in the plasma free fatty acid (FFA) fraction was determined in 100 subjects at increased risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity was estimated during an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) at baseline and after 9 months of lifestyle intervention and measured during the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp (n = 79) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Circulating <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32372">palmitoleate</z:chebi> (OGTT:F ratio = 8.2, P = 0.005; clamp:F ratio = 7.8, P = 0.007) but not total FFAs (OGTT:F ratio = 0.6, P = 0.42; clamp:F ratio = 0.7, P = 0.40) correlated positively with insulin sensitivity, independently of age, sex, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>High baseline <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32372">palmitoleate</z:chebi> predicted a larger increase in insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For 1-SD increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32372">palmitoleate</z:chebi>, the odds ratio for being in the highest versus the lowest tertile of adjusted change in insulin sensitivity was 2.35 (95% CI 1.16-5.35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Circulating <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32372">palmitoleate</z:chebi> strongly and independently predicts insulin sensitivity, suggesting that it plays an important role in the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in humans </plain></SENT>
