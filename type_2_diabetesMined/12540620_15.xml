<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined whether arterial stiffness in different regions is equally affected by <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and other factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The subjects were 161 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 129 healthy subjects comparable in age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Arterial stiffness was evaluated by measuring pulse wave velocity (PWV) in the heart-carotid, heart-brachial, heart-femoral, and femoral-ankle segments using an automatic device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diabetic patients had greater PWV than the healthy subjects in the four arterial regions, and the effect of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on PWV was greater in the heart-carotid and heart-femoral segments (central) than in the heart-brachial and femoral-ankle regions (peripheral) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PWV increased with age in the four arterial regions, and the effect of age on PWV was greater in the central than in peripheral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In multiple regression analysis, age and systolic blood pressure had significant impacts on PWV of the four regions, whereas <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was significantly associated only with PWV of the central arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, sex was associated with PWV of the peripheral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had greater impact on PWV of the central arteries, and different factors were involved in PWV among different arterial regions </plain></SENT>
