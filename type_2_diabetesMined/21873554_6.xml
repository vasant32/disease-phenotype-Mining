<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The role of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-inducible factor 1 (HIF1) in the development of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> was investigated using animal models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Mice with adipocyte-specific targeted disruption of the genes encoding the HIF1 obligatory subunits Hif1α or Arnt (Hif1β) were generated using an aP2-Cre transgene with the Cre/LoxP system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mice were fed an HFD for 12 weeks and their metabolic phenotypes were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gene expression patterns in adipose tissues were also determined by microarray and quantitative PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On an HFD, adipocyte-specific ARNT knockout mice and adipocyte-specific HIF1α knockout mice exhibit similar metabolic phenotypes, including reduced fat formation, protection from HFD-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> compared with similarly fed <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cumulative food intake remained similar; however, the metabolic efficiency was lower in adipocyte-specific HIF1α knockout mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, indirect calorimetry revealed respiratory exchange ratios were reduced in adipocyte-specific HIF1α knockout mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies demonstrated that targeted disruption of HIF1α in adipocytes enhanced whole-body insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The improvement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> is associated with decreased expression of Socs3 and induction of adiponectin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of HIF1 in adipose tissue ameliorates <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study reveals that HIF1 could provide a novel potential therapeutic target for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
