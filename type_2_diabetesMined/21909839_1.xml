<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to ascertain the role of these four variants in conferring susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the Japanese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We genotyped 11,530 Japanese individuals (8,552 type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> cases, 2,978 controls) for the above single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and used logistic regression analysis to determine whether they were associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In accordance with the findings in a Chinese population, rs10906115 A, rs1359790 C and rs1436955 G were found to be risk alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both rs10906115 and rs1359790 were significantly associated with susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in our study (rs10906115 OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.08, 1.22; p = 6.10 × 10(-6); rs1359790 OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.06, 1.21; p = 2.24 × 10(-4)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adjustment for age, sex and BMI had no significant effects on the association between these variants and the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We did not observe any significant associations between the SNPs and any metabolic traits, e.g. BMI, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (determined for 1,332 controls), HOMA of beta cell function (900 controls) and HOMA of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (900 controls; p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The SNPs rs10906115 A and rs1359790 C are significantly associated with susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the Japanese population, confirming that these alleles are common susceptibility variants for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in East Asian populations </plain></SENT>
