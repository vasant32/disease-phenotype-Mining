<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A prospective observational study in Australia (Newcastle, NSW) of 137 consecutive patients with type 1 (n=82) or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n=55) over two successive years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four educational principles were used to teach intensive insulin management and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-care skills including: carbohydrate counting and insulin dose adjustment, exercise, appropriate treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e>, managing sickness, problem solving, communication with health professionals, goal setting, and the importance of support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Outcomes included changes at 4 and 12 months in HbA1c, self-efficacy measured by a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> empowerment scale (DES), <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> specific quality of life (ADDQoL), and problem solving </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both intention to treat and efficacy analyses were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp>-related quality of life and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> problem solving skills improved significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Excluding 16 people who failed to adopt intensive insulin management and 24 who started with an HbA1c less than 7%, intention to treat analysis showed the average HbA1c fell from 8.7% initially to 8.1% at 12 months and the number of people with an HbA1c of less than 8% rose from 67 (48.9%) before the program to 86 (62.8%) afterwards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: An intensive <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-management program led to improvements in HbA1c, empowerment, and quality of life that were largely sustained at 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the more remarkable given that the intervention was once only, entailed no long-term follow-up, and took place in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> clinical operations </plain></SENT>
