<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The voltage-gated K+ channel, K(V)2.1, is expressed in beta-cells, and the biophysical characteristics of heterologously expressed channels are similar to those of I(DR) in rodent beta-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A novel peptidyl inhibitor of K(V)2.1/K(V)2.2 channels, guangxitoxin (GxTX)-1 (half-maximal concentration approximately 1 nmol/l), has been purified, characterized, and used to probe the contribution of these channels to beta-cell <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In mouse beta-cells, GxTX-1 inhibits 90% of I(DR) and, as for K(V)2.1, shifts the voltage dependence of channel activation to more depolarized potentials, a characteristic of gating-modifier <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>GxTX-1 broadens the beta-cell action potential, enhances <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated intracellular calcium oscillations, and enhances insulin secretion from mouse pancreatic islets in a <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data point to a mechanism for specific enhancement of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent insulin secretion by applying blockers of the beta-cell I(DR), which may provide advantages over currently used therapies for the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
