<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Study to Help Improve Early evaluation and management of risk factors Leading to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> (SHIELD) examined prevalence of <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> symptoms and their association with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: SHIELD is a 5-year observational study of individuals with or at risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following an initial screening phase, follow-up questionnaires were mailed to a stratified random sample of individuals (n = 22,001) with type 1 or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or at high (three to five risk factors) or low (zero to two risk factors) risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Individuals reported whether they experienced each <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> symptom, as well as symptoms unrelated to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 15,794 questionnaires were returned (response rate 71.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> symptoms were reported more frequently in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than in low- and high-risk groups (P &lt; 0.0001 for each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariable logistic regression analyses found that each <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> symptom other than <z:hpo ids='HP_0000737'>irritability</z:hpo> was significantly associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, as was erectile/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033953" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">sexual dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, 48% of type 1 diabetic and 44% of type 2 diabetic respondents reported no <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> symptom in the previous year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Occurrence of <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> symptoms alone may not adequately identify those who should be evaluated for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Longitudinal data from SHIELD will evaluate whether combinations of symptoms or addition of other symptoms can better identify individuals for evaluation </plain></SENT>
