<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This pilot study tested the impact of a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk assessment completed by patients without nursing assistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients from a family medicine residency clinic completed an American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association Risk Assessment questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intervention subjects presented completed questionnaires to their physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Control subjects returned the questionnaire to the research assistant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Primary endpoints were the number of persons receiving <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> screening and the number of persons with newly diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The associations between the intervention and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> screening and diagnosis were assessed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: This study included 511 subjects (256 in the intervention group and 255 in the control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Comparing intervention to control subjects, there was no difference in fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> screening rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, odds of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnoses were significantly higher using univariate analysis (OR 5.2; 95% CI 1.1-24.3, p=.036) and approached statistical significance after adjusting for other risk factors (OR 4.6; 95% CI 0.92-23.2, p=.063) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A simple patient-based risk assessment used in the outpatient setting may represent a simple, economical method for discovering previously-undiagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
