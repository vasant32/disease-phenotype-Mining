<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effect of <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi> ingestion on insulin sensitivity in sedentary lean men (n = 8) and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> men with (n = 7) and without (n = 8) type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We also examined whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> exercise influences the relationship between <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi> and insulin sensitivity in these individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Subjects underwent two hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp procedures, <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi> (5 mg/kg body wt) and placebo, in a double-blind, randomized manner before and after a 3-month aerobic exercise program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Body composition was measured by magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi> ingestion was associated with a significant reduction (P &lt; 0.05) in insulin sensitivity by a similar magnitude in the lean (33%), <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (33%), and type 2 diabetic (37%) groups in comparison with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After exercise training, <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi> ingestion was still associated with a reduction (P &lt; 0.05) in insulin sensitivity by a similar magnitude in the lean (23%), <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (26%), and type 2 diabetic (36%) groups in comparison with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Exercise was not associated with a significant increase in insulin sensitivity in either the <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi> or placebo trials, independent of group (P &gt; 0.10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">Caffeine</z:chebi> consumption is associated with a substantial reduction in insulin-mediated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake independent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> exercise </plain></SENT>
