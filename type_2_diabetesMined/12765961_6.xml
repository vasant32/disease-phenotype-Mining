<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Oji-Cree population of the Sandy Lake region of Ontario, Canada, has the third highest prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Changes in their diet and physical activity over the past half-century, particularly the marked increase in consumption of dietary fats, are felt to be important factors accounting for this epidemic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to examine the beta-cell response to a 48-h approximately twofold elevation of plasma free fatty acids (FFAs) (induced by Intralipid and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> infusion) in members of the Sandy Lake Oji-Cree population (n = 12) and to compare the response to that in healthy age-matched nondiabetic Caucasian subjects (n = 16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The insulin secretion rate, insulin sensitivity index (S(I)), and disposition index (D(I)) (an index of insulin secretion that takes into account the ambient S(I)) were assessed in response to a 4-h graded intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion followed by a 20 mmol/l 2-h hyperglycemic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Total insulin secretory response to the graded <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion did not change after a 48-h FFA elevation versus saline control in Caucasians and increased by approximately 30% in Oji-Cree individuals (P = 0.04 for difference between the two groups) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Infusion of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-Intralipid reduced S(I) by approximately 40% in both groups (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although D(I) was markedly reduced by <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-Intralipid infusion in Caucasians (by approximately 40%), it was reduced by only 15% in Oji-Cree individuals (P = 0.03 for difference of response between the two groups) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, S(I) and D(I) in the Oji-Cree individuals were already much lower than in Caucasians at baseline, in keeping with the very high risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that Oji-Cree individuals from a community at very high risk for developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are not more susceptible to the FFA-induced desensitization of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion than healthy non-Natives and, in fact, appear to be less susceptible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Whether this reflects an inherent resistance to lipotoxicity or an already-present lipotoxic effect in this population will require further study </plain></SENT>
