<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined whether exposure to TZDs affects hip fracture in women and men and compared the risk to that found with other drugs used in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using a nationwide database of prescriptions, hospital admissions and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in those with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Scotland we calculated TZD exposure among 206,672 individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Discrete-time failure analysis was used to model the effect of cumulative drug exposure on hip fracture during 1999-2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 176 hip fractures among 37,479 exposed individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hip fracture risk increased with cumulative exposure to TZD: OR per year of exposure 1.18 (95% CI 1.09, 1.28; p = 3 Ã— 10(-5)), adjusted for age, sex and calendar month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hip fracture increased with cumulative exposure in both men (OR 1.20; 95% CI 1.03, 1.41) and women (OR 1.18; 95% CI 1.07, 1.29) and risks were similar for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (OR 1.18) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> (OR 1.16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The association was similar when adjusted for exposure to other drugs for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and for other potential confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no association of hip fracture with cumulative exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> or insulin in this analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 90-day mortality associated with hip fractures was similar in ever-users of TZD (15%) and in never-users (13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Hip fracture is a severe adverse effect with TZDs, affecting both sexes; labels should be changed to warn of this </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The excess mortality is at least as much as expected from the reported association of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005684" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bladder cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
