<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, data on substrate source utilisation in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are inconclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: [U-(13)C]<z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> and [6,6-(2)H(2)]<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tracers were used to assess plasma NEFA and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> oxidation rates and to estimate the use of muscle- and/or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>-derived triacylglycerol and muscle <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects were ten male patients who had a long-term (7 +/- 1 years) diagnosis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and were overweight, and ten matched healthy, male control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Muscle biopsy samples were collected before and after exercise to assess muscle fibre type-specific intramyocellular <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At rest and during exercise, the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients had greater values than the controls for <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> rate of appearance (Ra) (rest, 2.46 +/- 0.18 and 1.85 +/- 0.20 respectively; exercise, 3.71 +/- 0.36 and 2.84 +/- 0.20 micromol kg(-1) min(-1)) and rate of disappearance (Rd) (rest, 2.45 +/- 0.18 and 1.83 +/- 0.20; exercise, 3.64 +/- 0.35 and 2.80 +/- 0.20 micromol kg(-1) min(-1) respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was accompanied by significantly higher fat oxidation rates at rest and during recovery in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients (rest, 0.11 +/- 0.01 in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients and 0.09 +/- 0.01 in controls; recovery, 0.13 +/- 0.01 and 0.11 +/- 0.01 g/min respectively), despite significantly greater plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> Ra, Rd and circulating plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, exercise significantly lowered plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients, as a result of increased blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that substrate source utilisation in long-term-diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients, in whom compensatory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020459" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperinsulinaemia</z:e> is no longer present, shifts towards an increase in whole-body fat oxidation rate and is accompanied by disturbances in fat and carbohydrate handling </plain></SENT>
