<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Both in research and in various clinical situations, prolonged euglycaemia can be desirable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In recent years, its benefit in (critically) ill patients and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> has been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to assess safety and efficacy of a practical, bodyweight-dependent algorithm to establish euglycaemia in both lean and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 43 patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 17 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> insulin were infused overnight to establish euglycaemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration was determined at 45 min intervals, and the insulin infusion rate was altered according to the algorithm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Baseline plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations were 13.1+/- 4.4 and 12.7 +/- 4.0 mmol/l in type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In both groups mean plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was reduced below 8.0 mmol/l within 3 h, and averaged 7.4 +/- 1.4 and 7.2 +/- 1.0 mmol/l (P = 0.11) over the next 7 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five (11.6%) patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> required administration of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> because plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations fell below 4.4 mmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Consequently, type 1 diabetic patients were hypoglycaemic during 0.89% of the total study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The lowest plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> recorded was 3.9 mmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the type 2 diabetic patients the lowest plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was 5.5 mmol/l and no <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> administration was required for near-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The algorithm was equally effective in both lean and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Euglycaemia was established simply, swiftly and safely during the study period with the practical weight-based algorithm used in this study, in both lean and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients, with a very low rate of mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The algorithm is applicable in research and various several clinical settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Its validity for a prolonged period of time and in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">critically ill</z:e> patients needs to be further evaluated </plain></SENT>
