<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We explored this hypothesis in the Hertfordshire Cohort Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 465 men and 444 women aged 59 to 71 years and with no prior diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> attended a clinic where a <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test was performed and bone density measured at the femoral neck and lumbar spine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Biochemical markers of bone turnover (serum osteocalcin and urinary mean c-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type II collagen) were measured in 163 men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: According to WHO criteria, 83 men and 134 women were diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> and a further 33 men and 32 women were diagnosed as having type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bone density was higher in newly diagnosed diabetic subjects, with relationships stronger in women (p&lt;0.001) than men (p&lt;0.05) and attenuated by adjustment for body mass index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In both sexes, we observed positive correlations between the total femur and femoral neck bone mineral density with measures of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (r=0.17-0.22), with stronger results observed in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These relationships did not apply after adjustment for body mass index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> status did not lead to differences in osteocalcin level or c-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type II collagen levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020459" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperinsulinaemia</z:e> may affect bone mineral density through indirect effects, e.g. body weight </plain></SENT>
