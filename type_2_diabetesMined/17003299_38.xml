<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Inverse associations between <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> and calcium intakes and risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have been reported for studies in predominantly white populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi>, calcium, and major food sources in relation to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in African-American women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study including 41,186 participants of the Black Women's Health Study without a history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who completed validated food frequency questionnaires at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During 8 years of follow-up (1995-2003), we documented 1,964 newly diagnosed cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for the highest compared with the lowest quintile of intake was 0.69 (95% CI 0.59-0.81; P trend &lt;0.0001) for dietary <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> and 0.86 (0.74-1.00; P trend = 0.01) for dietary calcium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After mutual adjustment, the association for calcium disappeared (hazard ratio 1.04 [95% CI 0.88-1.24]; P trend = 0.88), whereas the association for <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> remained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Daily consumption of low-fat dairy (0.87 [0.76-1.00]; P trend = 0.04) and whole grains (0.69 [0.60-0.79]; P trend &lt;0.0001) were associated with a lower risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with a consumption less than once a week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After mutual adjustment, the hazard ratio was 0.81 (0.68-0.97; P trend = 0.02) for <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> and 0.73 (0.63-0.85; P trend &lt;0.0001) for whole grains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that a diet high in <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi>-rich foods, particularly whole grains, is associated with a substantially lower risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in U.S. black women </plain></SENT>
