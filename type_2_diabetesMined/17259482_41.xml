<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Given the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the U.S., and clear benefit of exercise in disease prevention and management, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of physical activity among adults with and at risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey is a nationally representative survey of the U.S. population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the 2003 survey, 23,283 adults responded when asked about whether they were physically active (moderate or vigorous activity, &gt; or =30 min, three times per week) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Information on sociodemographic characteristics and health conditions were self-reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additional type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk factors examined were age &gt; or =45 years, non-Caucasian ethnicity, BMI &gt; or =25 kg/m(2), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 39% of adults with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were physically active versus 58% of adults without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proportion of active adults without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> declined as the number of risk factors increased until dropping to similar rates as people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for sociodemographic and clinical factors, the strongest correlates of being physically active were income level, limitations in physical function, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (BMI &gt; or =40 kg/m(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Several traditional predictors of activity (sex, education level, and having received past advice from a health professional to exercise more) were not evident among respondents with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or at highest risk for developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> do not engage in regular physical activity, with a rate significantly below national norms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There is a great need for efforts to target interventions to increase physical activity in these individuals </plain></SENT>
