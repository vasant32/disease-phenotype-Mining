<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine whether defects in the insulin signal transduction cascade are present in skeletal muscle from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetic</z:e> individuals, we excised biopsies from eight <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-intolerant male first-degree relatives of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (IGT relatives) and nine matched control subjects before and during a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IGT relatives were insulin-resistant in oxidative and nonoxidative pathways for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In vivo insulin infusion increased skeletal muscle insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) tyrosine phosphorylation (P = 0.01) and phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) activity (phosphotyrosine and IRS-1 associated) in control subjects (P &lt; 0.02) but not in IGT relatives (NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incremental increase in insulin action on IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation was lower in IGT relatives versus control subjects (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incremental defects in signal transduction noted for IRS-1 and PI 3-kinase may be attributed to elevated basal phosphorylation/activity of these parameters, because absolute phosphorylation/activity under insulin-stimulated conditions was similar between IGT relatives and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020459" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Insulin increased</z:e> Akt serine phosphorylation in control subjects and IGT relatives, with a tendency for reduced phosphorylation in IGT relatives (P = 0.12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, aberrant phosphorylation/activity of IRS-1, PI 3-kinase, and Akt is observed in skeletal muscle from relatives of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with IGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the elevated basal activity of these signaling intermediates and the lack of a strong correlation between these parameters to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism suggests that other defects of insulin signal transduction and/or downstream components of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism may play a greater role in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in skeletal muscle from relatives of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
