<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the effects of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on blood flow velocities (BFVs) in the middle cerebral arteries and to determine the relationship between white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and BFVs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We measured BFVs in 28 type 2 diabetic and 22 control subjects (aged 62.3 +/- 7.2 years) using transcranial Doppler ultrasound during baseline, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> rebreathing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>WMHs were graded, and their volume was quantified from fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images on a 3.0 Tesla MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The diabetic group demonstrated decreased mean BFVs and increased cerebrovascular resistance during baseline, hypo- and <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp> (P &lt; 0.0001), and impaired <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> reactivity (P = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>WMH volume was negatively correlated with baseline BFV (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A regression model revealed that baseline BFVs were negatively associated with periventricular WMHs, HbA(1c) (A1C), and inflammatory markers and positively associated with systolic blood pressure (R(2) = 0.86, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Microvascular disease in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, which manifests as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002500'>white matter abnormalities</z:hpo> on MRI, is associated with reduced cerebral BFVs, increased resistance in middle cerebral arteries, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings are clinically relevant as a potential mechanism for cerebrovascular disease in elderly with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
