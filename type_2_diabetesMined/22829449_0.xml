<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to examine the association between genetic predisposition to <z:mp ids='MP_0002842'>high blood pressure</z:mp> and risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> in individuals with T2D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The current study included 1,005 men and 1,299 women with T2D from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study and Nurses' Health Study, of whom 732 developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A genetic predisposition score was calculated on the basis of 29 established blood pressure-associated variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The genetic predisposition score showed consistent associations with risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> in men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the combined results, each additional blood pressure-increasing allele was associated with a 6% increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> (odds ratio [OR] 1.06 [95% CI 1.03-1.10]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The OR was 1.62 (1.22-2.14) for risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> comparing the extreme quartiles of the genetic predisposition score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The genetic association for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk was significantly stronger in patients with T2D than that estimated in the general populations by a meta-analysis (OR per SD of genetic score 1.22 [95% CI 1.10-1.35] vs. 1.10 [1.08-1.12]; IÂ² = 71%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that genetic predisposition to <z:mp ids='MP_0002842'>high blood pressure</z:mp> is associated with an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> in individuals with T2D </plain></SENT>
