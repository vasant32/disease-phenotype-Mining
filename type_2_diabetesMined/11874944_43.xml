<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Traditional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> (CVRF) only partly explain the excessive risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is now an increasing appreciation for many novel CVRF that occur largely as a result of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we investigated whether <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> medications that vary in their mechanism of action and ability to reduce <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> may differ in their effects on both traditional and novel CVRF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We compared the addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> therapy on CVRF in 22 subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who remained in poor glycemic control (with HbA1c &gt;8.5%) while taking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi> 10 mg twice daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects were initially randomized to either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> 850 mg once daily or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> 200 mg once daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both medications were then titrated upward as needed to achieve fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &lt;120 mg/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Measures of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, and CVRF (blood pressure, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, and small dense <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>) were assessed both before and after therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 4 months of treatment, both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> led to similar decreases in fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and HbA1c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The reduction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> determined by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp was nearly twofold greater with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> did not induce significant changes in blood pressure, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> size, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, or plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, C-reactive protein did decrease by 33% (6 +/- 1 to 4 +/- 1 mg/l; P &lt; 0.01) [corrected] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">Troglitazone</z:chebi> therapy was associated with increases in <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> size (26.21 +/- 0.22 to 26.56 +/- 0.25 nm; P=0.04) and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (33 +/- 3 to 36 +/- 3 mg/dl; P=0.05) and decreases in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (197 +/- 19 to 155 +/- 23 mg/dl; P=0.07) and C-reactive protein by 60% (8 +/- 3 to 3 +/- 1 mg/l, P &lt; 0.01) [corrected] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: For patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in whom maximal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> therapy failed, the addition of the insulin sensitizer <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> seemed to have greater benefits on several traditional and novel CVRF than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These differences were not related to glycemic improvement but reflected, in part, the greater reduction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> obtained with addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that medications that more effectively address this underlying metabolic defect may be more beneficial in reducing cardiovascular risk in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
