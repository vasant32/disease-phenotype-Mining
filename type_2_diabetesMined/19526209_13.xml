<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The recent expansion in the number of validated type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>- and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-susceptibility loci, coupled with access to empirical data, enables us to look for evidence in support (or otherwise) of the thrifty genotype hypothesis using proven loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We employed a range of tests to obtain complementary views of the evidence for selection: we determined whether the risk allele at associated 'index' single-nucleotide polymorphisms is derived or ancestral, calculated the integrated haplotype score (iHS) and assessed the population differentiation statistic fixation index (F (ST)) for 17 type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 13 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found no evidence for significant differences for the derived/ancestral allele test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None of the studied loci showed strong evidence for selection based on the iHS score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We find a high F (ST) for rs7901695 at TCF7L2, the largest type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> effect size found to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our results provide some evidence for selection at specific loci, but there are no consistent patterns of selection that provide conclusive confirmation of the thrifty genotype hypothesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Discovery of more signals and more causal variants for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> is likely to allow more detailed examination of these issues </plain></SENT>
