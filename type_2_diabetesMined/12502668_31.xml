<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of sibutramine (15 and 20 mg/day) on weight, metabolic control, and blood pressure in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>-treated <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A 12-month randomized prospective placebo-controlled double-blind study was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It included 21 primary and secondary care centers in England, Canada, France, and Belgium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 195 subjects (44% male) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and a BMI &gt;27 kg/m(2) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Changes were assessed in weight, blood pressure and resting heart rate, HbA(1c), fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sibutramine induced significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.001) with both 15 mg/day (5.5 +/- 0.6 kg at 12 months) and 20 mg/day (8.0 +/- 0.9 kg), whereas placebo did not (0.2 +/- 0.5 kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>Weight loss</z:hpo> &gt; or = 10% was achieved by 14 and 27% of subjects receiving 15 and 20 mg, respectively, but by none given placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Glycemic control improved in parallel with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, and subjects who lost &gt; or = 10% weight showed significant decreases in both HbA(1c) (1.2 +/- 0.4%, P &lt; 0.0001) and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (1.8 mmol/l, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> increased slightly with the higher dose, whereas plasma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> fell with both doses, especially in subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> of &gt; or = 10% (a 29% decrease, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment was generally well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sibutramine treatment raised sitting diastolic blood pressure by &gt; or = 5 mmHg in a higher proportion of patients than did placebo (43% with 15 mg/day vs. 25% with placebo, P &lt; 0.05), but this effect was less evident in subjects who had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> of &gt; or = 10% weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Pulse rate increased significantly more with sibutramine, being &gt; or = 10 bpm higher in 42% of treated patients versus 17% with placebo (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Sibutramine can be an effective adjunct to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> treatment in selected <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> type 2 diabetic subjects and improves metabolic control in individuals who lose weight </plain></SENT>
