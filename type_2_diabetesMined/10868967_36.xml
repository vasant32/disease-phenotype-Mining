<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Lower birth weight is associated with an increased occurrence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in later life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether this relationship is explained by environmental or genetic factors is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have examined the potential for genetic influences by determining whether parental <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is associated with lower birth weight in 1,608 children of known birth weight and gestational age born between 1941 and 1993 in the Gila River Indian Community in Arizona </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The previously described relationships of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>maternal diabetes</z:hpo> to <z:mp ids='MP_0009673'>increased birth weight</z:mp> and offspring <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast to this we have determined novel relationships between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birth weight</z:hpo> and paternal <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The offspring of diabetic fathers were, on average, 78 g lighter than the offspring of nondiabetic fathers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For fathers, lower birth weight in their offspring was associated with an increased risk of later <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, i.e., fathers of offspring in the lowest quintile of birth weight, who were not diabetic at the time of birth of their child, had a 1.8-fold increased risk of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> later in life (95% CI 1.2-2.7; P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For children, lower birth weight predicted <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the offspring if paternal but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>maternal diabetes</z:hpo> was present, but it was not associated with higher plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> if neither parent had <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birth weight</z:hpo> is strongly related to the development of paternal <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, suggesting a genetic link between lower birth weight and later <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
