<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that an elevated total or intra-abdominal adipose tissue accumulation mediates the relationship between low SHBG levels and an altered metabolic profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We measured body composition (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry [DEXA]) and body fat distribution (computed tomography) in 52 middle-aged (46.7 +/- 0.4, mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) premenopausal women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Insulin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> responses to a 75-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> load and plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> levels were also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Low plasma SHBG concentrations were associated with increased total body fat mass (r = -0.41, P &lt; 0.005) and subcutaneous abdominal (r = -0.39, P &lt; 0.005) and intra-abdominal (r = -0.37, P &lt; 0.008) adipose tissue area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Low SHBG was also associated with a greater insulin response to oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (r = -0.40, P &lt; 0.005), higher <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels (r = -0.29, P &lt; 0.05), higher cholesterol/<z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> ratio (r = -0.51, P &lt; 0.005), but lower <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> concentrations (r = 0.65, P &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When matched for intra-abdominal fat or total fat mass, subjects with either low or high SHBG showed no difference in the insulin response to an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Statistical adjustment for differences in intra-abdominal adipose tissue accumulation or total body fat mass also eliminated the associations between SHBG levels and metabolic variables, with the exception of the association between SHBG and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> levels (r = 0.52, P &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the previously reported relationship between low SHBG levels and increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disease</z:e> risk in women is mediated, to a large extent, by concomitant variation in body fatness and intra-abdominal adipose tissue accumulation </plain></SENT>
