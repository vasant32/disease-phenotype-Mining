<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We previously reported suggestive linkage between type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and markers in a region on chromosome 20q using data from a collection of 29 Caucasian families in which type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003596'>middle-age-onset</z:hpo> was segregated as an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal-dominant</z:hpo> disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To map more precisely the susceptibility locus (or loci) within this broad region, we increased the family collection and genotyped <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> families for additional markers, both within the critical region and spaced over the rest of chromosome 20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Altogether 526 individuals (including 241 with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) from the total collection of 43 families were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> individuals were genotyped for 23 highly polymorphic markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Positive evidence for linkage was found for a 10-cM region on the long arm of chromosome 20q13.1-q13.2 between markers D20S119 and D20S428 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The strongest evidence in two-point as well as multipoint linkage analysis (P = 1.8 x 10(-5)) occurred at the position corresponding to marker D20S196 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The individuals with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the seven most strongly linked families had high serum insulin levels during fasting and 2-h post-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> load periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We did not find any evidence for linkage between type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and any other region on chromosome 20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our larger and more comprehensive study showed very strong evidence for a susceptibility gene for insulin-resistant type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> located on the long arm of chromosome 20 around marker D20S196 </plain></SENT>
