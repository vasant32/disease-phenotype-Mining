<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients (n = 273) on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (&gt;/=1500 mg/day) were randomized to receive the addition of once-daily placebo, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> 100 mg or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> 8 mg in a 1 : 1 : 1 ratio for 18 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The efficacy analysis was based on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-patients-treated population using an analysis of co-variance with change in HbA(1c) from baseline as the primary endpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean baseline HbA(1c) was 7.7% for the entire cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 18 weeks, both active add-on therapies led to greater improvements in HbA(1c) from baseline: -0.73% for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> (p &lt; 0.001 vs. placebo) and -0.79% for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> compared with -0.22% for placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No difference was observed between the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> treatments (0.06% [95% confidence interval (CI): -0.14 to 0.25]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proportion of patients achieving an HbA(1c) &lt; 7% was greater with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> (55%) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> (63%) compared with placebo (38%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Body weight increased from baseline with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> (1.5 kg) compared with body weight reduction with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> (-0.4 kg) and placebo (-0.8 kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The difference in body weight between the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> groups was 1.9 kg (95% CI: 1.3-2.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In a prespecified analysis, the proportion of patients experiencing a greater than 3-kg increase in body weight was 21% in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> group compared with 2% in both the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> and placebo groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both active treatments were generally well tolerated, with no increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> or gastrointestinal adverse events compared with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this 18-week study, the addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> was effective and well tolerated in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> inadequately controlled with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> produced similar reductions in HbA(1c) compared with the addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
