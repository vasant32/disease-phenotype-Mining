<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">Rosiglitazone</z:chebi> prevents <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in people with high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels who have <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> and/or impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effect of this drug on both <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels and beta-cell mass was studied in a rat model of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, characterized by reduced beta-cell mass at birth with normoglycaemia, and progression to dysglycaemia with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Female Wistar rats were given either saline (vehicle) or <z:chebi fb="164" ids="18723">nicotine</z:chebi> during pregnancy and lactation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Offspring of saline-exposed dams were given vehicle and offspring of <z:chebi fb="164" ids="18723">nicotine</z:chebi>-exposed dams were randomized to receive either vehicle or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> starting at weaning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Beta-cell mass, proliferation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were determined at birth and at 4 and 26 weeks of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis was examined following sequential oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests (OGTT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">Rosiglitazone</z:chebi> treatment prevented the development of dysglycaemia in <z:chebi fb="164" ids="18723">nicotine</z:chebi>-exposed animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ability of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> to preserve normoglycaemia appeared to be because of its ability to increase beta-cell mass through a combination of enhanced beta-cell proliferation and decreased beta-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that if <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> administration is started prior to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of glucometabolic abnormalities, it prevents the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of dysglycaemia by partially restoring beta-cell mass in animals with reduced beta-cell mass at birth </plain></SENT>
