<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: with the aim of evaluating predictive power, three simple screening tests as alternates to nerve conduction tests for diagnosing diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> (DPN) were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Results of the screening tests, along with the subjects' demographic and clinical characteristics, were planned as the variables for the development of a risk assessment tool for predicting DPN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: this is a cross-sectional multi-group comparison study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study utilized a predictive model derived from one subset of the study population, and prospectively tested in the other subset to predict the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011882" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Diabetic Neuropathy</z:e> Research Clinic of the Toronto General Hospital and University Health Network in Toronto, Ontario, Canada from June 1998 to August 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SAMPLE POPULATION: data come from 478 subjects consisting of non-diabetic reference subjects, and patients with type 1 and type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>OUTCOMES MEASURES: nerve conduction studies (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi>) comprised the primary defined outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The three screening sensory tests examined in the study were the Semmes-Weinstein 10 g monofilament examination (SWME), superficial pain sensation, and vibration by the on-off method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: the three screening tests are significantly and positively correlated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18022">NCS </z:chebi></plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An increase in the number of insensate responses in the screening test is associated with an increase in the abnormal <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi> score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The strength of the association between <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi> and each sensory test was greater when the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> severity stage of the subject was added to the model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Both the SWME and vibration by the on-off method tests demonstrated sufficient statistical power to differentiate non-diabetic control subjects from subjects with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, as well as to differentiate subjects with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with and without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These two tests, when compared with <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi>, also demonstrated acceptable diagnostic performance characteristics in terms of high sensitivity and specificity, total number of correctly predicted cases, and receiver-operating characteristic curves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: this data, through the development of a model involving training and validation sets, demonstrates that the knowledge of clinical risk factors alters the interpretation of sensory tests for DPN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This finding lends further support to the validity of simple sensory testing maneuvers in the conditional diagnosis of DPN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>We recommend annual screening with either the SWME or vibration by the on-off method in the primary care and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> clinics </plain></SENT>
