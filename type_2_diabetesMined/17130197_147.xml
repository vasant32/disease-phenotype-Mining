<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: After a screening diet/exercise run-in period, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> dose titration/stabilization period, and a 2-week, single-blind, placebo run-in period, 701 patients, aged 19-78 years, with mild to moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> (mean A1C 8.0%) receiving ongoing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (&gt;or=1,500 mg/day) were randomly assigned to receive the addition of placebo or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> 100 mg once-daily in a 1:2 ratio for 24 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients exceeding specific glycemic limits were provided rescue therapy (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>) until the end of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The efficacy analyses were based on an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-patients-treated population using an ANCOVA and excluded data obtained after glycemic rescue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At week 24, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> treatment led to significant reductions compared with placebo in A1C (-0.65%), fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and 2-h postmeal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fasting insulin, fasting C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, fasting proinsulin-to-insulin ratio, postmeal insulin and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> areas under the curve (AUCs), postmeal insulin AUC-to-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> AUC ratio, homeostasis model assessment of beta-cell function, and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index were significantly improved with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> relative to placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significantly greater proportion of patients achieved an A1C &lt;7% with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> (47.0%) than with placebo (18.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> or gastrointestinal adverse experiences with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> compared with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Body weight decreased similarly with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> and placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">Sitagliptin</z:chebi> 100 mg once-daily added to ongoing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> therapy was efficacious and well tolerated in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who had inadequate glycemic control with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> alone </plain></SENT>
