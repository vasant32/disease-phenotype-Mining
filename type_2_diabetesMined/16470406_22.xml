<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>People who were in utero during the Dutch famine had decreased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance and raised insulin concentrations at age 50 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to evaluate whether prenatal famine exposure leads to more <z:hpo ids='HP_0003678'>rapid progression</z:hpo> of impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>/insulin homeostasis with increasing age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed an OGTT in 702 men and women at age 50 and in 699 men and women at age 58, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> born as term singletons immediately before, during or after the 1944-1945 Dutch famine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: People who had been exposed to famine in utero had significantly higher 120-min <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations at age 58 compared with people who had not been exposed to famine (difference=0.4 mmol/l, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.7, adjusted for sex and BMI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> tolerance deteriorated between the age of 50 and 58 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The unadjusted 120-min <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations rose by 0.2 mmol/l (95% CI 0.0 to 0.4), while 120-min insulin concentrations had increased by 64 pmol/l (95% CI 48 to 82) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in the rates of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin level increase between the famine-exposed group and the unexposed group (p=0.28 for the difference in increase in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations and p=0.09 for insulin concentrations) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Although we confirmed that undernutrition during gestation is linked to decreased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, the effect does not seem to become more pronounced at age 58 as compared with age 50 </plain></SENT>
