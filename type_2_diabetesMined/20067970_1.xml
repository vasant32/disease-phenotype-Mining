<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate to what extent the association between family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> can be explained by excess <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> and lifestyle risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed data from 73,227 women who participated in the Nurses' Health Study cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was defined as having at least one first-degree family member with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lifestyle factors, weight, and height were assessed by using validated questionnaires, and BMI was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relative risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was estimated using Cox proportional hazards analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We documented 5,101 cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during 20 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The age-adjusted relative risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in participants with a family history was 2.27 (95% CI 2.14-2.40) compared with the risk in those without a family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Participants with a family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had a higher BMI and were more likely to have a parental history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>BMI explained 21.1% (19.4-22.9) of the association between family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intakes of red meat, alcohol, and sugar-sweetened beverages explained 1.1% (0.8-1.3), 4.8% (4.3-5.3), and 2.8% (2.4-3.2) of this association, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that excess <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> and, to a lesser extent, specific dietary habits can explain a substantial part of the association between having a family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
