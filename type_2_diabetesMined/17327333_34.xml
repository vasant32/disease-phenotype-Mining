<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We examined whether proteomic technologies identify novel urine proteins associated with subsequent development of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> before evidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a nested case-control study of Pima Indians with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, baseline (serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> &lt;1.2 mg/dl and urine albumin excretion &lt;30 mg/g) and 10-year urine samples were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Case subjects (n = 31) developed diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> (urinary albumin-to-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio &gt;300 mg/g) over 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Control subjects (n = 31) were matched to case subjects (1:1) according to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration, age, sex, and BMI but remained normoalbuminuric (albumin-to-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio &lt;30 mg/g) over the same 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS) was performed on baseline urine samples, and training (14 cases:14 controls) and validation (17:17) sets were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, A1C levels differed between case and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SELDI-TOF MS detected 714 unique urine protein peaks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of these, a 12-peak proteomic signature correctly predicted 89% of cases of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> (93% sensitivity, 86% specificity) in the training set </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Applying this same signature to the independent validation set yielded an accuracy rate of 74% (71% sensitivity, 76% specificity) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analyses, the 12-peak signature was independently associated with subsequent diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> when applied to the validation set (odds ratio [OR] 7.9 [95% CI 1.5-43.5], P = 0.017) and the entire dataset (14.5 [3.7-55.6], P = 0.001), and A1C levels were no longer significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Urine proteomic profiling identifies normoalbuminuric subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who subsequently develop diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to characterize the specific proteins involved in this early prediction </plain></SENT>
