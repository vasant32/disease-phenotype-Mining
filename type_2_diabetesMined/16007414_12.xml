<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesised that these variants may be associated with childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Height and weight were recorded for 2454 prepubertal children aged between 4 and 10 years, who were then genotyped for three common variants of the PPARG locus: C-681G, Pro12Ala and C1431T </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No single variant of PPARG was significantly associated with height, weight or BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, when modelling the variants together we detected an opposing interaction between the -681G and the Ala12 variants in height and weight, but not BMI (p=0.018, 0.013 and 0.119 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The data were consistent with the Ala12 carriers being deficient in energy storage/utilisation, leading to reduced growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the -681G variant, which has been associated with increased adult height, was associated with accelerated growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The two variants were in strong linkage disequilibrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, rare individuals bearing the isolated variants demonstrated the greatest variation from the mean, the most contrasting genotypes being associated with a variation of 7 kg in weight and 6 cm in height, standardised to 7.4-year-olds (p=0.006 and p=0.02 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: This study demonstrates that quantitative trait analysis of energy balance/growth and the PPARG locus is complex and requires the use of multiple genetic markers </plain></SENT>
