<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We review the progress in testing the thrifty phenotype hypothesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many human epidemiological studies both by ourselves and others have confirmed and extended the original observations on which the hypothesis was based </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We are not aware of any contradictory findings and we emphasise the strength of the association between birth weight and the subsequent development of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have worked extensively experimentally to test the hypothesis in a rat model in which pregnant and/or lactating dams are fed a diet moderately restricted in proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The range of programming effects that we have discovered in this example of fetal and early postnatal growth restriction is listed and includes changes in hormone receptors, signalling molecules and regulatory enzymes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have shown the model to develop <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> and signs of premature <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We summarise these and other similarities between the phenotype of this model and human Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The number of insults during early development which can lead to a similar outcome is discussed and the suggestion is made that the early life response to stress is limited in its flexibility with outcomes including ageing and decreased longevity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our preliminary results indicate that some MODY genes could suggest pathways whereby the changes occur and that epigenetic changes during development are involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the way is now clear to discover early human markers of programming by early life growth restriction and to use these to devise strategies for the prevention of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
