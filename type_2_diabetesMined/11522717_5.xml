<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 10 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Turner syndrome</z:e> who were off hormone replacement therapy (aged 32.7 +/- 8.9 years) and a control group of 14 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> women (aged 35.6 +/- 9.3 years) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>None of the participants had <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or any family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test was performed, and insulin sensitivity was assessed by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) and a composite whole-body insulin sensitivity index (ISI(comp)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Physical fitness was assessed, and a muscle biopsy was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Turner syndrome</z:e> were insulin resistant, as seen by a lower ISI(comp) (P = 0.003) and increased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.0005) and insulin (P = 0.01) levels at 120 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>Impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> was present in most <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Turner syndrome</z:e> patients (6 of 10), but not in the control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Turner syndrome</z:e> had an <z:mp ids='MP_0001264'>increased size</z:mp> of type IIa fibers (P = 0.01), whereas the size of their type I and IIa fibers were comparable with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The groups did not differ in percentage of type I, Iia, or IIx fibers, and there was no difference in the capillary density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significant correlations were found among ISI(comp), the HOMA index (R(HOMA)), and the mean area of type IIa fibers (ISI(comp): r = -0.632, P = 0.002; R(HOMA): r = 0.570, P = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, capillaries/type IIa fibers correlated significantly with ISI(comp) (r = -0.618, P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no significant correlations between VO(2max) and muscle fiber composition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Healthy women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Turner syndrome</z:e> are characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, low physical capacity, and enlarged type IIa muscle fibers, indicating diminished oxygen and substrate supply for metabolic processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These findings could be indicative of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetic state</z:e> </plain></SENT>
