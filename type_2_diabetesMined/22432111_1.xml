<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Two consecutive population-based surveys for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were conducted in randomly selected adults aged 35-74 years in Shanghai in 2002-2003 (n = 12,329) and in 2009 (n = 7,423) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was determined based on self-report, whereas those undiagnosed were identified by measured fasting and postload <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> according to 2009 American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Age-standardized prevalence of diagnosed and undiagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> increased from 5.1 and 4.6% in 2002-2003 to 7.4 and 5.2% in 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> increased with age and was higher among men and in urban residents in both surveys (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Between the two surveys, the increase in the prevalence was more evident in the rural population (P &lt; 0.001) and appeared more rapid in younger birth cohorts (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that Shanghai has experienced an increasing burden of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
