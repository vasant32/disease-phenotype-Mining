<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cox's proportional hazard models were used on data from the National Birth Cohort Study (the MRC National Survey of Health and Development), which was begun in 1946 and had self-reported physician-diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> ranging from 31 to 53 years (n=78 cases, and n=47 cases in the multivariate analysis) as the outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A U-shaped association between birthweight and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> rates was close to statistical significance (quadratic term p value=0.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Younger age at <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> rebound was associated with increased rates of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (test for trend p=0.002), the association being robust to adjustment for each of sex, birthweight, weight at 2 years, father's social class, parental <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and own social class </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect of early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> rebound was very slightly reduced by adjustment for sex and adult height (p=0.003), but considerably reduced after adjustment for sex and adult BMI (test for trend p=0.1), and further reduced (p=0.4) after additional adjustment for birthweight, weight at 2 years, adult height, social class of subject and of his/her father, and parental <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> rebound was associated with an increased rate of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> independently of birthweight, but its effect was mostly through high adult BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Parental <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and possibly <z:hpo ids='HP_0004325'>low weight</z:hpo> at 2 years were also risks </plain></SENT>
