<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether plasma concentrations of thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were associated with components of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> (MS), including high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 136 consecutive patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of MS was diagnosed by current criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>Hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> (HC) was defined as serum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> &gt;140 mg/dl (3.6 mmol/l) or treatment with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For comparisons, diabetic patients were divided into four groups: those with no MS and no HC (n = 38), with MS but not HC (n = 39), with no MS but with HC (n = 26), and with both MS and HC (n = 33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Considering <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, plasma PAI-1 was strongly associated with MS components such as BMI, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>, alanine aminotransferase, a homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, and hs-CRP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma TAFI only correlated positively and independently with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasma concentrations of plasmin-alpha2-antiplasmin complex (<z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp>), a measure of fibrinolytic activity in blood, showed a significant negative correlation with plasma PAI-1 but not TAFI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Diabetic patients with both MS and HC had the highest serum hs-CRP concentrations and the lowest plasma <z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> is a main determinant of plasma TAFI in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Coexistence of MS and HC synergistically accelerates <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and impairment of fibrinolysis via elevated concentrations of both TAFI and PAI-1, which inhibit fibrinolysis </plain></SENT>
