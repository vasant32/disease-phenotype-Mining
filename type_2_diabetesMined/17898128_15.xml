<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A prospective, biracial cohort was examined up to five times during 1985-2006 in the multicenter, U.S. population-based Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The analysis included 2,408 women (1,226 black and 1,182 white) aged 18-30 years who were free of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and had a fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) &lt;126 mg/dl at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was diagnosed by self-report, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> medication use, FPG &gt;or=126 mg/dl, and/or plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &gt;or=200 mg/dl after a 2-h oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> load </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Time-dependent interim birth groups were those with zero and those with one or more births with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> mellitus (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e>), stratified by baseline parity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Complementary log-log models estimated relative hazards of incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by interim births adjusted for age, race, family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and baseline covariates (FPG, BMI, education, smoking, and physical activity) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 193 incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> cases in 42,782 person-years (4.5 cases/1,000 person-years), 84 (44%) had one or more interim births </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among nulliparas at baseline, incident rates per 1,000 person-years were 3.2 (95% CI 2.4-4.1) for those with no births, 2.9 (1.8-3.9) for one or more births without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e>, and 18.4 (10.9-25.9) for one or more births with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e>; adjusted relative hazards (95% CI) were 0.9 (0.6-1.4) for one or more births without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> and 3.8 (2.2-6.6) for one or more births with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> versus no births </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Childbearing did not elevate <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence among those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance during pregnancy (without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> conferred the highest risk of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> independent of family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and preconception glycemia and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
