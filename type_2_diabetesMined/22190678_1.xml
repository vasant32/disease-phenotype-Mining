<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Short-term endurance training can modify their fATP and insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examines the effects of moderate long-term exercise using endurance or resistance training in this cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A randomized, parallel-group trial tested 16 glucose-tolerant nonobese relatives (8 subjects in the endurance training group and 8 subjects in the resistance training group) before and after 26 weeks of endurance or resistance training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Exercise performance was assessed from power output and oxygen uptake (VO(2)) during incremental tests and from maximal torque of knee flexors (MaxT(flex)) and extensors (MaxT(ext)) using isokinetic dynamometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>fATP and ectopic <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> were measured with (1)H/(31)P magnetic resonance spectroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Endurance training increased power output and VO(2) by 44 and 30%, respectively (both P &lt; 0.001), whereas resistance training increased MaxT(ext) and MaxT(flex) by 23 and 40%, respectively (both P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups, insulin sensitivity (382 ± 90 vs. 389 ± 40 mL · min(-1) · m(-2)) and ectopic <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> contents were comparable after exercise training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, 8 of 16 relatives had 26% greater fATP, increasing from 9.5 ± 2.3 to 11.9 ± 2.4 μmol · mL(-1) · m(-1) (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Six of eight responders were carriers of the G/G single nucleotide polymorphism rs540467 of the NDUFB6 gene (P = 0.019), which encodes a subunit of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> complex I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Moderate exercise training for 6 months does not necessarily improve insulin sensitivity but may increase ATP synthase flux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Genetic predisposition can modify the individual response of the ATP synthase flux independently of insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
