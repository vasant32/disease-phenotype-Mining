<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied seven healthy lean male subjects and seven <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> male subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> using the forearm muscle balance technique with continuous intravenous infusion of the stable isotope tracer [U-(13)C]<z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> under baseline conditions and during intravenous infusion of the nonselective beta-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoprenaline</z:chebi> (ISO; 20 ng *kg(-1) lean body mass* min(-1)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In skeletal muscle of control subjects, there was a significant release of (13)C-labeled oxidation products in the form of (13)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> (15% of (13)C uptake from labeled <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi>) and a significant release of (13)C-labeled glutamine (release of (13)C-labeled atoms from glutamine was 6% of (13)C uptake from labeled <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi>), whereas in type 2 diabetic subjects there was no detectable release of (13)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> and (13)C-glutamine, despite a significant uptake of [U-(13)C]<z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> (60% of control value) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was net uptake of arterial (13)C-labeled <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> by forearm muscle in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Also, the ISO-induced increase in arterial glutamine enrichment and arterial concentration of (13)C-glutamine was more pronounced in the diabetic group relative to control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In view of the diminished ISO-induced release of (13)C-glutamine from type 2 diabetic muscle, the latter data indicate that more [U-(13)C]<z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> entered the liver in the diabetic group and was incorporated into newly synthesized glutamine and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, the lack of release of (13)C-labeled oxidation products by type 2 diabetic muscle during beta-adrenergic stimulation, despite significant [U-(13)C]<z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> uptake, indicates differences in the handling of fatty acids between type 2 diabetic subjects and healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
