<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: Ten T2DM patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> (M group), 10 with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">Glyburide</z:chebi> (G group) and 10 age-paired healthy subjects exercised on a bicycle ergometer up to exercise peak </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular and blood metabolic and hormonal parameters were measured at times -60 min, 0 min, exercise end, and at 10 and 20 minutes of recovery phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty minutes before the exercise, a standard breakfast was provided to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diabetic patients took <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">Glyburide</z:chebi> before or with meal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Peak oxygen uptake (VO(2)) was lower in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels remained unchanged, but were higher in both diabetic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> also presented lower insulin levels after meals and higher glucagon levels at exercise peak than C group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> levels were higher in G than M group at exercise end and recovery phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">Lactate</z:chebi> levels were higher in M than G group at fasting and in C group at exercise peak </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nor <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi>, GH and FFA responses were similar in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Progressive exercise performed to exhaustion, in the post-prandial state did not worsen <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control during and after exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The administration of the usual dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">Glyburide</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> to T2DM patients did not influence the cardiovascular, metabolic and hormonal response to exercise </plain></SENT>
