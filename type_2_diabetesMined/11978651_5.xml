<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is not clear whether this polymorphism is associated with atherosclerotic arterial wall thickening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the association of C807T polymorphism with arterial wall thickness in 265 control subjects and 272 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects, intima-media thickness of the right carotid artery in the 807TT group (0.649 +/- 0.028 mm [SE]) was significantly (P = 0.0228, Scheffe's F test) less than in the 807CC group (0.767 +/- 0.033) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This effect of polymorphism is gene dose dependent (P = 0.0227, ANOVA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The similar association was also observed in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> but not in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multiple regression analysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects revealed that the T allele was inversely (beta = -0.095, P = 0.021) associated with intima-media thickness independent of age, HbA(1c), and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, an inverse relation between the occurrence of carotid plaque and the T allele was observed in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with an adjusted odds ratio of 0.487 (P = 0.031) in multiple logistic regression analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the number of 807T alleles in alpha2 integrin is protective against atherosclerotic arterial wall thickening and the occurrence of plaque in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
