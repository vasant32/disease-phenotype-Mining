<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a matched cohort study using the U.K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>General Practice Research Database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Case subjects were aged 30-89 years, diagnosed with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and later prescribed oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic drugs</z:chebi> between 1997 and 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Control subjects, who were matched for age, sex, and general practice, were not diagnosed with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and not treated with oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic drugs</z:chebi> or insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Data were analyzed for 5,158 case subjects (2,492 women and 2,666 men) and their matched control subjects with a mean age of 63 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five years before the date of diagnosis, case subjects consulted more frequently than control subjects (rate ratio [RR] 1.26 [95% CI 1.20-1.33]) and received more prescription items (1.44 [1.36-1.53]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Consultations were increased for a wide range of conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cumulative 5-year prevalence of diagnoses of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> or treatment, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> or treatment, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was 66.1% in case subjects and 45.9% in control subjects (1.44 [1.40-1.49]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A medical diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> was highly (&gt;99%) specific for later diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Primary care consultations and drug utilization are increased from 5 years before diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Diagnoses of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> have moderate sensitivity for subsequent <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> but are nonspecific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> has a high specificity for later detection of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
