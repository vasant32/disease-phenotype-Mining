<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have often been presented as disease forms that profoundly differ in the presence and pathogenic significance of a reduced beta-cell mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We review evidence indicating that the beta-cell mass in type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is usually not decreased by at least 90% at clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, and remains often detectable for years after diagnosis at age above 15 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical and experimental evidence also exists for a reduced beta-cell mass in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> where it can be the cause for and/or the consequence of dysregulated beta-cell functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With beta-cell mass defined as number of beta-cells, these views face the limitation of insufficient data and methods for human organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because beta-cells can occur under different phenotypes that vary with age and with environmental conditions, we propose to use the term functional beta-cell mass as an assessment of a beta-cell population by the number of beta-cells and their phenotype or functional state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Assays exist to measure functional beta-cell mass in isolated preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We selected a <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-clamp test to evaluate functional beta-cell mass in type 1 patients at clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and in type 1 recipients following intraportal islet cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the data with those in non-diabetic controls helps targeting and monitoring of therapeutic interventions </plain></SENT>
