<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The subjects consisted of overweight subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (NGT, n=10), IGT (n=10) and DM (n=10) (age: 51.1+/-8.2, 56.3+/-8.8 and 58.5+/-6.2 years, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of these patients performed exercise therapy at <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> threshold intensity for 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Before intervention, area under the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> curve (AUC(PG)) was higher in DM, IGT and NGT groups, and area under the insulin curve (AUC(IRI)) and the early phase insulin secretion as calculated by insulinogenic index was higher in the NGT group than in either the IGT or DM groups (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After exercise therapy, the insulin sensitivity, AUC(PG) and AUC(IRI) improved in three groups (p&lt;0.05, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The insulinogenic index increased in IGT and DM groups (p&lt;0.05, respectively), but the changes in the insulinogenic index showed no significant differences between IGT and DM groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the ss-cell function in subjects with IGT and DM could therefore improve after exercise therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, AUC(PG), AUC(IRI) and insulin sensitivity were also improved no relation to NGT, IGT and DM </plain></SENT>
