<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adiponectin, a novel circulating anti-inflammatory protein made by adipocytes, has been reported to be lower in diabetic than nondiabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, serum levels of adiponectin are elevated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We sought to investigate the relation between adiponectin and mild to moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo> in men with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate the relation between serum adiponectin concentrations and the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo> (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] &lt;60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) by the four-variable Modification of Diet in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Renal Disease</z:e> equation) in participants with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the Health Professionals' Follow-Up Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 733 men were included in this cross-sectional analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Adiponectin was positively correlated with age (Spearman coefficient, r = 0.19, P &lt; 0.001) and negatively correlated with weight (Spearman coefficient, r = -0.18, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Those with adiponectin in the second quartile or higher (&gt;10 microg/ml) compared with those in the first quartile had a reduced odds for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo> (multivariate odds ratio 0.48 [95% CI 0.28-0.81]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results were unchanged when serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> were included in the multivariate model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that a higher serum adiponectin concentration is associated with reduced odds of moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo> in men with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
