<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed sex differences in the treatment of CHD risk factors among patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis included 3,849 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treated in five academic internal medicine practices from 2000 to 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Outcomes were stratified by the presence of CHD and included adjusted odds ratios (AORs) that women (relative to men) were treated with hypoglycemic, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering medications or aspirin (if indicated) and AORs of reaching target HbA(1c), blood pressure, or <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Women were less likely than men to have HbA(1c) &lt;7% (without CHD: AOR 0.84 [95% CI 0.75-0.95], P = 0.005; with CHD: 0.63 [0.53-0.75], P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Women without CHD were less likely than men to be treated with <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering medication (0.82 [0.71-0.96], P = 0.01) or, when treated, to have <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> levels &lt;100 mg/dl (0.75 [0.62-0.93], P = 0.004) and were less likely than men to be prescribed aspirin (0.63 [0.55-0.72], P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Women with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and CHD were less likely than men to be prescribed aspirin (0.70 [0.60-0.83], P &lt; 0.0001) or, when treated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, were less likely to have blood pressure levels &lt;130/80 mmHg (0.75 [0.69-0.82], P &lt; 0.0001) or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> levels &lt;100 mg/dl (0.80 [0.68-0.94], P = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Women with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> received less treatment for many modifiable CHD risk factors than diabetic men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>More aggressive treatment of CHD risk factors in this population offers a specific target for improvement in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care </plain></SENT>
