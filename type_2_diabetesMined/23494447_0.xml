<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A population-based cross-sectional design was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>People diagnosed with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the preceding 6 months were recruited from primary care practices in three adjacent inner-city boroughs of South London, serving a population in which 20% of residents are of black African or Caribbean ethnicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sociodemographic and biomedical data were collected by standardised clinical assessment and from medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression methods were used to report associations between ethnicity and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-complication status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From 96 general practices, 1,506 patients were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Their mean age was 55.6 (±11.07) years, 55% were men, 60% were asymptomatic at diagnosis and 51%, 38% and 11% were of white, black and South Asian/other ethnicity, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with white participants, black and South Asian/other participants were: younger (mean age 58.9 [±10.09], 52.4 [±11.19] and 51.5 [±10.42] years, respectively; p &lt; 0.0001); less likely to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> (10.1%, 3.6% and 4.4%; p &lt; 0.0001) or report <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (12.7%, 4.8% and 7.3%; p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In logistic regression, compared with white participants, black participants had lower levels of macrovascular complications (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.32, 0.84; p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Male sex was independently associated with microvascular disease (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.26, 2.28; p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The prevalence of complications at time of diagnosis was lower than expected, especially in black and South Asian/other ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, in multi-ethnic inner-city populations, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> occurred almost 10 years earlier in non-white populations than in white participants, predicating a prolonged morbidity </plain></SENT>
