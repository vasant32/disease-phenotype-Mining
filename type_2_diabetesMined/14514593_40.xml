<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Previous reports have predicted greater risk of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among people who were heavier as young children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Accelerator Hypothesis predicts earlier <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in heavier people, without necessarily a change in risk, and views type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> as the same disorder of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, set against different genetic backgrounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo> is a function of fat mass, and increasing body weight in the industrialized world has been accompanied by earlier presentation (i.e., acceleration) of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We wanted to establish whether increasing body weight was also associated with the earlier presentation of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, as the Accelerator Hypothesis would predict </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The relationships between fatness and age at diagnosis were examined in context of birth weight, weight change since birth, weight at diagnosis, BMI at diagnosis, and BMI 12 months later in 94 children aged 1-16 years (49 boys and 45 girls) presenting for management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute-onset</z:hpo> type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BMI standard deviation score (<z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>) at diagnosis, weight <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> change since birth, and BMI <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> 12 months later were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> inversely related to age at presentation (r = -0.39 to -0.40, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The boys were significantly fatter than the girls (BMI <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> 0.56 vs. -0.08, respectively; P = 0.006) and presented with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at a significantly younger age (6.74 vs. 8.32 years, respectively; P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The sex difference in age at diagnosis, however, disappeared when corrected for BMI (P = 0.31), suggesting that fatness or something related to it was the responsible factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The data are consistent with the hypothesis that the age at presentation of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is associated with fatness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The implications for prevention of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may be important </plain></SENT>
