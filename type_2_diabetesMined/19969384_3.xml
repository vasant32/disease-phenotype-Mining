<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The reduction of podocyte number and density per glomerulus has been linked to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> and the progression of disease in patients with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> (DN) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it has been recognized that measurement of podocyte number by light microscope is quite difficult because of the complexity of both podocyte and glomerular structure, which is not suitable for clinical research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In our research institute, we used WT1 as podocyte marker to evaluate the podocyte lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In our experiment, we selected the C-terminal antibody of WT1 to stain the nuclei and the N-terminal antibody of WT1 to stain the cytoplasma of podocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty patients were enrolled with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and proven to have DN by renal biopsy analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DN patients were classified into three groups based on the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo>: <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> (n=10, 30-300mg/24h), overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> (n=15, 0.5-3.5g/24h), and heavy <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> (n=15, &gt;3.5g/24h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results demonstrated that the podocyte number was markedly decreased in patients with DN (30-51% reduction) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a significant negative correlation between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> and both podocyte density and number </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cover area density of podocyte cytoplasma in glomerulus was also significantly decreased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> DN patients (39-80% reduction) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A significant inverse correlation was observed between the cover area density and the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The correlation coefficient (r=-0.85) was much higher than that between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> and podocyte density (r=-0.56) or podocyte number (r=-0.36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In conclusion, podocyte damage occurred in patients with DN, even in the early stage and became more dramatic during the course of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>WT1 staining, using the polyclonal antibody to stain the nuclei and monoclonal antibody to stain the cytoplasma of podocytes together, is a valuable alternative technique in the study of podocyte injury </plain></SENT>
