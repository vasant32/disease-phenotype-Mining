<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> continues to rise in the US </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> (GLP-1RA) is an effective treatment option for type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) that promotes <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Common and effective treatment options added to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> therapy (basal insulin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>) contribute to <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>, which makes the addition of GLP-1RAs advantageous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Exenatide was the first agent in this class and has recently been approved for use in combination with insulin glargine by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Until recently, there was a lack of data examining basal insulin combined with these agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The main purpose of this article is to review the prospective interventional data on the safety and efficacy of GLP-1RAs (exenatide, liraglutide, albiglutide, lixisenatide) combined with basal insulin therapy in nonpregnant adults with T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Databases searched were PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the Database of Systematic Reviews (inception to January 2012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Abstracts presented at relevant <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> meetings from 2009 to 2011 were also reviewed, as were reference lists of identified publications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A total of five studies met the criteria and were included in the review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Data from these studies demonstrated that this combination therapy offers advantages for the treatment of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, such as additional lowering of A1c without major risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>, lower basal insulin requirements, decreased postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels (with or without fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> decreases), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, or at the very least, less <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the gastrointestinal side effects and high cost of these agents may limit their use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This review demonstrates that adding a GLP-1RA to an existing basal insulin regimen is a reasonable treatment strategy in nonpregnant adult patients with T2DM </plain></SENT>
