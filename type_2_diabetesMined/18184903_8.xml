<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Seven-field stereoscopic photographs of both eyes were obtained at the baseline assessment of the ADVANCE trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> photographs were graded in a central reading center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Gradable <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> images were received from 1,605 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The number of patients with any <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (Early Treatment of Diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>Retinopathy</z:hpo> Study [ETDRS] score &gt; or = 20) was 645 (40.2% [95% CI 37.8-42.6]); of these, 35 (2.2% [1.6-3.0]) had severe diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (ETDRS score &gt; or = 50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Focal arterial narrowing, venous beading, and arteriovenous nicking were present in 3.8, 5.1, and 9.8% of participants, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among participants included in this study, Chinese and South-Asian patients had more <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> than Caucasians, as defined both by ETDRS score (49.4, 46.0, and 31.3%, respectively; P &lt; 0.001, adjusted for age, sex, A1C, systolic blood pressure, and duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) and specific vascular lesions (e.g., arteriovenous nicking 12.3, 8.5, and 7.5%, respectively; adjusted P &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A1C, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and systolic blood pressure were similarly associated with increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0007863'>retinal lesions</z:hpo> in Chinese, South-Asian, and Caucasian patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Using a sensitive diagnostic procedure, more than one-third of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> enrolled in the AdRem study had <z:hpo ids='HP_0007863'>retinal lesions</z:hpo> at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Despite differences in prevalence and severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> among Chinese, South-Asian, and Caucasian patients included in this study, the cross-sectional associations among established risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0007863'>retinal lesions</z:hpo> were similar across ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
