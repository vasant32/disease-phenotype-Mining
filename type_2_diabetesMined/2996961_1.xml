<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The L-allele, i.e. fragments with an average size of about 600 base-pairs seems to be a weak genetic marker for Type 1 (insulin-dependent) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, whereas the U-allele, i.e. fragments of an average size of about 2500 base-pairs hitherto has been associated with Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and diabetic hypertriglyceridaemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most recent reports on this subject do not confirm an association between the U-allele and Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our own studies indicate that the U-allele is a fairly strong marker for the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (relative risk for U-carriers 3.36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The putative functions of the polymorphic region in atherogenesis and the relation of this region to other genetic markers for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> are not known </plain></SENT>
