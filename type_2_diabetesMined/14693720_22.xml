<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two regions showed significant linkage to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>/IGH in the Chinese </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The region showing linkage to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>/IGH from the entire sample group analysis was located on chromosome 6q21-q23 (128.93 cM, 1-LOD [logarithm of odds] support interval between 124 and 142 cM, according to the Marshfield genetic map), with a maximum likelihood score of 6.23, a nonparametric linkage (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) score of 4.48, and empirical P value &lt;0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With a subanalysis based on 101 affected sibpairs with age at diagnosis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>/IGH &lt;40 years, we detected significant evidence for linkage to chromosome 1q21-q24 (192.1 cM, 1-LOD support interval between 182 and 197 cM), with a maximum likelihood score of 8.91, a nonparametric linkage (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) score of 5.70, and empirical P value &lt;0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No interaction was observed between these two regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our independent replication of the region on chromosome 1q that has been shown to be linked significantly to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>/IGH in Chinese supports the notion that gene(s) in this region may be universally important in the development of human type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
