<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine whether the beta-cells of GK rats, a nonobese <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519106" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">rodent model</z:e> of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, exhibit abnormalities in their SNARE proteins, we studied the expression and function of target (t)-SNAREs, syntaxin 1A, and synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25) in GK rat islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although insulin release and insulin content of islets isolated from 12-week-old GK rats were reduced, the proinsulin biosynthetic rate was about twofold higher than that in control rat islets, and no change in the preproinsulin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pulse-chase experiments suggested the increased degradation of insulin in GK rat islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunoblot analysis revealed that protein levels of syntaxin 1A and SNAP-25 in GK rat islets decreased to approximately 60% of the levels in control rat islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We then examined whether the restoration of the decreased expression of t-SNAREs to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> level in GK rat islets affected insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Restoration was achieved by the overexpression of syntaxin 1A and SNAP-25 via the recombinant adenovirus-mediated gene transduction system, which recovered levels of these proteins to almost control levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin release from AdexlCA syntaxin 1A and Adex1CA SNAP-25-infected GK rat islets increased up to approximately 135 and 200%, respectively, of those from uninfected GK rat islets, although no difference in basal (2.2 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>) insulin release was evident between them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that decreased expression of t-SNAREs in GK rat islets is in part the defect responsible for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948379" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">impaired insulin secretion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
