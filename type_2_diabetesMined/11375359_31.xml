<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether group visits, delivered as routine <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care and structured according to a systemic education approach, are more effective than individual consultations in improving metabolic control in non-insulin-treated type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a randomized controlled clinical trial of 112 patients, 56 patients were allocated to groups of 9 or 10 individuals who participated in group consultations, and 56 patients (considered control subjects) underwent individual visits plus support education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> visits were scheduled every 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 2 years, HbA(1c) levels were lower in patients seen in groups than in control subjects (P &lt; 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Levels of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> had increased in patients seen in groups but had not increased in control subjects (P = 0.045) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BMI (P = 0.06) and fasting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> level (P = 0.053) were lower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients participating in group visits had improved knowledge of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P &lt; 0.001) and quality of life (P &lt; 0.001) and experienced more appropriate health behaviors (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Physicians spent less time seeing 9-10 patients as a group rather than individually, but patients had longer interaction with health care providers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Group consultations may improve metabolic control in the medium term by inducing more appropriate health behaviors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>They are feasible in everyday clinical practice without increasing working hours </plain></SENT>
