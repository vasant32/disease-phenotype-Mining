<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a community-based, placebo-controlled 3 year prospective study, 407 participants with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (mean age 45.3 +/- 6.2 years, mean BMI 25.9 +/- 3.3 kg/m(2)) were sequentially grouped to receive either: lifestyle modification plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>, 30 mg (n = 204) or lifestyle modification plus placebo (n = 203) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The participants and investigators were blinded to the assignment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, both groups had similar demographic, anthropometric and biochemical characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At year 3, the response rate was 90.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 29.8% with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> and 31.6% with placebo (unadjusted HR 1.084 [95% CI 0.753-1.560], p = 0.665) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Normoglycaemia was achieved in 40.9% and 32.3% of participants receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> and placebo, respectively (p = 0.109) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> group, two <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> and two non-fatal hospitalisations occurred due to cardiac problems; in the placebo group there were two occurrences of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Despite good adherence to lifestyle modification and drug therapy, no additional effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> was seen above that achieved with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The effectiveness of the intervention in both groups was comparable with that of lifestyle modification alone, as reported from the Indian <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Prevention Programme-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results are at variance with studies that showed significant relative risk reduction in conversion to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> in Americans with IGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>An ethnicity-related difference in the action of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> in non-diabetic participants may be one explanation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00276497 Funding: This study was funded by the India <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Research Foundation </plain></SENT>
