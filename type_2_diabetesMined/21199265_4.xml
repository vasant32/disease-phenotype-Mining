<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This short-term pilot study evaluates its effects in type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: this double-blind, randomized, investigator-initiated, single-centred, 12-week pilot study evaluated 40 adults (age = 36.4 ± 9.4 years) with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (duration = 20.4 ± 8.5 years) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020473" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperlipidaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was powered to show a treatment difference of &gt;10% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects received 3.75 g/day colesevelam (n = 20) or placebo (n = 20) for 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (A1c) levels were assessed at screening (week 2), baseline (week 0) and every 4 weeks throughout the treatment duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent insulinotropic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (GIP) levels were measured during 4-h meal (Boost Plus, Nestle HealthCare Nutrition Inc., Florham Park, New Jersey, USA) challenge tests (MCT) at baseline and 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: colesevelam treatment resulted in a significant reduction in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> values at 4 weeks [-12.1% (95% CI: -20.1 to -4.1), p = 0.004] which was sustained for the study duration (p = 0.005 at 12 weeks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The treatment group also showed a significant change in A1c from baseline at week 4; however, this was not significant for the study duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a significant median increase in GLP-1 levels during the first 2 h of the baseline MCT in the treated group but no difference at 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: during this short-term pilot study, colesevelam treatment effectively lowered <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> in patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Improvements in A1c seen at week 4 were not sustained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Effects on glycaemic control in subjects with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may be related to a postprandial rise in GLP-1 levels and require further clinical study </plain></SENT>
