<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>According to the physiological effects of insulin in the brain, disturbances of this signaling chain lead to an impairment of cognitive functions and a deterioration of eating behavior with a potential role in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and T2DM </plain></SENT>
