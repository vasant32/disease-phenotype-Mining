<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We prospectively examined plasma levels of leptin and soluble leptin receptor (sOB-R), as well as their interactions with other <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk factors, in relation to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> to elucidate the complex relation between these two biomarkers and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Of 32,826 Nurses' Health Study participants who provided blood samples during 1989-1990, 1,054 incident case subjects of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were identified and confirmed during 1990-2004 and 1,254 matched control subjects were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasma leptin and sOB-R levels were measured among these participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After multivariate adjustment for BMI, lifestyle practices, and dietary factors, sOB-R levels were significantly associated with a lower risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In comparison with women in the lowest quintile, the ORs (95% CI) of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were 0.73 (0.55-0.96), 0.51 (0.38-0.68), 0.42 (0.31-0.57), and 0.39 (0.28-0.54; P for trend &lt; 0.0001) for women in the second to fifth quintiles of sOB-R levels, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, plasma leptin levels were not significantly associated with the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>: The OR (95% CI) was 0.82 (0.62-1.10; P for trend = 0.46) comparing the highest with the lowest quintile of leptin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>sOB-R levels were consistently associated with a decreased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at various levels of leptin or high-molecular-weight adiponectin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest a strong inverse association between plasma sOB-R levels and risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, independent of BMI, leptin, and adiponectin levels </plain></SENT>
