<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Databases used for the search included Medline, PubMed, Cochrane EPOC, Cumulative Index to Nursing &amp; Allied Health Literature database guide (CINAHL), and PsychInfo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A composite estimate of effect size was calculated using a random effects model and subgroup analyses were conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine salient studies involving 9397 patients had sufficient data for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean patient age was 63.2 years, 49% were male, and ethnicity/race was 54% White </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was the focus in 91% of studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results showed a large overall effect size favoring case management intervention over controls or baseline values on HbA1c (ES=0.86, 95%CI: 0.52-1.19, Z=5.0, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This corresponds to a mean HbA1c reduction of 0.89 (95%CI: 0.63-1.15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analyses showed clinical setting, team composition, and baseline HbA1c were important predictors of effect size, but not <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-management education which was poorly described or absent in most <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> case management interventions examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nurse-led case management provides an effective clinical strategy for poorly controlled <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> based on a meta-analysis of clinical trials focusing on blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control </plain></SENT>
