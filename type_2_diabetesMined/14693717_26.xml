<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous data suggesting that polymorphisms in the adiponectin gene were associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have been inconsistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed the relationship between five common haplotype-tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the adiponectin gene (-11365C&gt;G, -4034A&gt;C, -3964A&gt;G, +45T&gt;G, and +276G&gt;T), haplotypes defined by these SNPs, and the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by conducting a nested case-control study of 642 incident cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 995 matching control subjects in the Nurses' Health Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Overall, we did not observe significant differences in genotype or allele frequencies for the five SNPs between the case and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk factors, the -4034 C/C genotype was associated with a reduced risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (odds ratio [OR] compared with the A/A genotype = 0.70, 95% CI 0.50-0.99, P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In subgroup analyses, the +276 genotype was significantly associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk only among subjects with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR gamma) variant 12Ala allele (OR comparing +276 T alleles with the G/G genotype = 1.69, 1.04-2.75, P = 0.035) or among <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects (1.46, 1.03-2.08, P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data suggest a potential interaction between the adiponectin genotype and PPAR gamma genotype or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, but these analyses should be considered exploratory and require further investigation in larger studies </plain></SENT>
