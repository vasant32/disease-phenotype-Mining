<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To estimate direct medical costs of managing the complications of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Costs were estimated for 15 diabetic complications by applying unit costs to typical resource-use profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Resource used and unit costs were estimated from many sources, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> care discharge databases, clinical guidelines, government reports, fee schedules, and peer-reviewed literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For each complication, the event costs are those associated with resource use that is specific to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> episode and any subsequent care occurring in the 1st year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>State costs are the annual costs of continued management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> costs are expressed in 1996 U.S. dollars </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: As expected, the more severe or debilitating events, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> ($27,630 event cost; $2,185 state cost), generate a greater financial burden than do early-stage complications, such as <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> ($62 event cost; $14 state cost) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Yet, complications that are initially relatively low in cost (e.g., <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp>) can progress to more costly advanced stages (e.g., <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal disease</z:hpo>, $53,659 state cost); therefore, minor complications should also be considered in any economic analysis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The recent literature has lacked cost estimates that may be readily translated into patient-level cost inputs for an economic model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Emerging therapies that may reduce the incidence of some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> will need to be scrutinized economically in today's cost-conscious environment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The cost estimates from this study provide one piece of the economic analysis needed to evaluate these new interventional therapies </plain></SENT>
