<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Enrolled patients had received treatment with diet and exercise in the previous 3 months with glycosylated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA1c) 7-10%, and were randomized to receive mitiglinide (n = 111, 5-20 mg/meal) or nateglinide (n = 114,60-120 mg/meal) for 16 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Primary and secondary efficacy endpoints were assessed by the changes in HbA1c, fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FBG) and postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (PBG) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The baseline HbA1c value was 8.2 and 8.3% in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the end of study, the reduction of HbA1c values from baseline by mitiglinide was slightly more than that by nateglinide (-1.11% vs. -0.76%), but not statically significant (p = 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Final FBG and PBG were comparable for the two treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 2.8% subjects treated with nateglinide who had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0745153" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemic episodes</z:e>, but none in the mitiglinide treatment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that mitiglinide and nateglinide had similar effects on FBG, PBG and HbA1c in T2DM patients after the 16-week treatments </plain></SENT>
