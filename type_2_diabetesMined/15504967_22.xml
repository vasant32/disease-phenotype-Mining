<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> increases with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine whether the hyperbolic relationship between insulin sensitivity and the insulin response is affected by age and whether the decline in beta-cell function with age is related to increases in intra-abdominal fat or age per se, we studied 220 healthy subjects with fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &lt;6.1 mmol/l (89 men and 131 women, aged 26-75 years, BMI 18.7-40.4 kg/m(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The insulin sensitivity index (S(i)) and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (AIRg) were determined, and from these beta-cell function was estimated as the disposition index (S(i) x AIRg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intra-abdominal fat and subcutaneous fat areas were quantified by computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>S(i) (5.40 +/- 0.5 vs. 7.86 +/- 0.7 x10(-5) min(-1)/[pmol/l]), P &lt; 0.01) was decreased and intra-abdominal fat (117 +/- 10 vs. 81 +/- 9 cm(2), P &lt; 0.05) was increased in the oldest (age 60-75 years) versus the youngest (age 26-44 years) quartile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The hyperbolic relationship between S(i) and AIRg was present independent of age; thus, beta-cell function measured as the disposition index (1,412 +/- 120 vs. 2,125 +/- 150 x10(-5) min(-1), P &lt; 0.01) was lower in the oldest versus the youngest quartile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In multiple regression, intra-abdominal fat (r = -0.470, P &lt; 0.001) but not age was associated with S(i), but both intra-abdominal fat (r = -0.198, P = 0.003) and age (r = -0.131, P = 0.05) were correlated with the disposition index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that although intra-abdominal fat is a strong determinant of insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function, age has an independent effect on beta-cell function that may contribute to the increased prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in older populations </plain></SENT>
