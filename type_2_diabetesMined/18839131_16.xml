<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We assessed body composition in 2,506 individuals, from a young Dutch genetic isolate participating in the Erasmus Rucphen Family study, by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and anthropometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used variance decomposition procedures to partition variation of body composition into genetic and environmental components common to both sexes and to men and women separately and calculated the correlation between genetic components in men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After accounting for age, sex and inbreeding, heritability ranged from 0.39 for fat mass index to 0.84 for height </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found sex-specific genetic effects for fat percentage (fat%), lean mass, lean mass index (LMI) and fat distribution, but not for BMI and height </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genetic correlations between sexes were significantly different from 1 for fat%, lean mass, LMI, android fat, android:gynoid fat ratio and WHR, indicating that there are sex-specific genes contributing to variation of these traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Genetic variance was significantly higher in women for the waist, hip and thigh circumference and WHR, implying that genes account for more variance of fat distribution in women than in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Environmental variance was significantly higher in men for the android:gynoid fat ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Sex-specific genetic effects underlie sexual dimorphism in several body composition traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The findings are relevant for studies on the relationship of body composition with common diseases like <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and for genetic association studies </plain></SENT>
