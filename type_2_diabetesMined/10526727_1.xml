<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Diet was assessed by 24-h recall in the SLVDS (n = 421) and by validated food frequency interview in the IRAS (n = 437) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analyses adjusted for kilocalories, age, sex, and other covariates were conducted separately for the two study groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For the SLVDS, repeated observations were included in mixed model analyses (865 observations) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the IRAS, standard regression analyses were conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recent weight history and time of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosis were evaluated as possible modifiers of associations between nutrient intake and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Higher reported intake of total dietary fat was related to significantly higher levels of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.05) in both studies and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reported intake of total and saturated fat was associated positively with total cholesterol, although statistical significance was not reached for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Higher reported carbohydrate intake was associated with increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> concentrations (P &lt; 0.01) only among individuals with previously undiagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the SLVDS (n = 69) and only among individuals who gained weight (&gt; 5 lb, n = 87) during the previous year in the IRAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Toward the goal of optimizing the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> profile of individuals with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, these results emphasize the potential importance of reducing fat intake while recognizing that individualized approaches to diet are important to minimize the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
