<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: A recent meta-analysis demonstrated a nominal association of the ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1) K--&gt;Q missense single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at position 121 with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We set out to confirm the association of ENPP1 K121Q with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, expand this association to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> traits, and determine whether the association stems from K121Q or another variant in linkage disequilibrium with it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We characterized the haplotype structure of ENPP1 and selected 39 tag SNPs that captured 96% of common variation in the region (minor allele frequency &gt; or =5%) with an r(2) value &gt; or =0.80 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We genotyped the SNPs in 2,511 Framingham Heart Study participants and used age- and sex-adjusted linear mixed effects (LME) models to test for association with quantitative metabolic traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also examined whether interaction between K121Q and BMI affected glycemic trait levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The Q allele of K121Q (rs1044498) was associated with increased fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG), A1C, fasting insulin, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P = 0.01-0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two noncoding SNPs (rs7775386 and rs7773477) demonstrated similar associations, but LME models indicated that their effects were not independent from K121Q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found no association of K121Q with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, but interaction models suggested that the effect of the Q allele on FPG and HOMA-IR was stronger in those with a higher BMI (P = 0.008 and 0.01 for interaction, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The Q allele of ENPP1 K121Q is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We found an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e>-SNP interaction, with a stronger association of K121Q with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related quantitative traits in people with a higher BMI </plain></SENT>
