<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 12,251 adults aged 45-64 years and free of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at baseline (1987-1989) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 1,447 cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were reported between baseline and 9 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> status was determined by fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level &gt; or =126 mg/dl (7.0 mmol/l), nonfasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level &gt; or =200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/l), self-report of physician diagnosis, or use of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Usual dietary intake over the previous year was obtained at baseline using a 66-item food-frequency questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nutrients were energy-adjusted using the residuals method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Proportional hazard regression analysis was used to examine dietary fiber intake and glycemic index as predictors of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in both ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After adjustment for age, BMI, education, smoking status, physical activity, sex, and field center, there were no statistically significant associations of intake of total dietary fiber, fruit fiber, legume fiber, glycemic index, or glycemic load with incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The hazard ratio for the fifth compared with the first quintile of cereal fiber was 0.75 (95% CI 0.60-0.92) in whites and 0.86 (0.65-1.15) in African-Americans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This finding supports a protective role for cereal fiber in the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>More studies are needed to determine the role of dietary fiber and glycemic index in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in African-Americans </plain></SENT>
