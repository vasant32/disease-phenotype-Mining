<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine whether leptin is a risk factor for development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Japanese Americans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We compared baseline leptin levels in 370 nondiabetic Japanese Americans who remained nondiabetic for 5-6 years of follow-up with those of 40 nondiabetic Japanese Americans who developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants had computed tomography measurements of baseline subcutaneous chest, abdomen, thigh, and intra-abdominal fat, with total fat defined as the sum of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age was 51.7 +/- 11.7 years for men and 51.9 +/- 12.0 years for women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 23 men who developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had significantly higher leptin levels than the 212 men who remained nondiabetic (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among men, baseline leptin levels predicted <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk independent of baseline total fat, insulin, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, or age in separate multiple logistic regression models (relative risk adjusted for baseline total fat = 1.80 per SD increase [2.7 ng/ml], 95% CI 1.02-3.17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This association was particularly strong among men in the top decile for intra-abdominal fat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the 17 women who developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had leptin levels similar to those of the 158 women who remained nondiabetic (P = 0.31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among Japanese Americans, increased baseline leptin levels are associated with increased risk of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in men but not in women </plain></SENT>
