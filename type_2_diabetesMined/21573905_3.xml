<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Carnosinase degrades <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15727">carnosine</z:chebi> (β-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="22280,32441">alanyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15971,29979">L-histidine</z:chebi>), which has been ascribed a renal protective effect as a scavenger of reactive oxygen species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the putative associations of genetic variants in CNDP1 and CNDP2 with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> (defined either as micro- or macroalbuminuria) and estimated GFR in type 2 diabetic patients from Sweden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We genotyped nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and one trinucleotide repeat polymorphism (D18S880, five to seven leucine repeats) in CNDP1 and CNDP2 in a case-control set-up including 4,888 unrelated type 2 diabetic patients (with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>) from Sweden (Scania <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Registry) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two SNPs, rs2346061 in CNDP1 and rs7577 in CNDP2, were associated with an increased risk of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> (rs2346061 p = 5.07 × 10(-4); rs7577 p = 0.021) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The latter was also associated with estimated GFR (β = -0.037, p = 0.014), particularly in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A haplotype including these SNPs (C-C-G) was associated with a threefold increased risk of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> (OR 2.98, 95% CI 2.43-3.67, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These data suggest that common variants in CNDP1 and CNDP2 play a role in susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
