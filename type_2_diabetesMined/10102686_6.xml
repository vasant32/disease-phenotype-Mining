<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These oscillations are easily entrainable to an exogenous rhythm by small changes in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We tested whether high-frequency insulin oscillations in vivo would also be entrainable by <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and whether a lack of entrainment would characterize the diabetic beta-cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We tested 13 control subjects and 11 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects underwent serial blood sampling at 1-min intervals for 60-120 min in the basal state or with small (15 mg/kg) boluses of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> injected intravenously at exact 29-min intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Time series analysis was carried out using spectral analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Oscillations of basal plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations were observed in both control and type 2 diabetic subjects, with a mean period of 11.3 +/- 3.1 and 11.6 +/- 2.0 min, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These oscillations were entrained to mean periods of 15.0 +/- 0.6 and 14.2 +/- 0.9 min, respectively, by exogenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Regular high-frequency insulin oscillations were observed in control subjects; the mean period of basal plasma insulin oscillations was 10.7 +/- 1.2 min and was entrained to exogenously injected <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, with a period of 15.2 +/- 0.1 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in the type 2 diabetic subjects, spontaneous insulin oscillations were unchanged by the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> rhythm; the mean periods were 10.0 +/- 1.0 min during the basal period, and 10.1 +/- 0.0 min during <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> injections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that spontaneous high-frequency insulin oscillations can be successfully entrained by <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, these oscillations in type 2 diabetic subjects are not similarly entrained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We conclude that loss of entrainment of spontaneous high-frequency insulin oscillations in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is a highly sensitive manifestation of beta-cell secretory dysfunction </plain></SENT>
