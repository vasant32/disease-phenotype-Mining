<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this qualitative study was to identify culturally relevant psychosocial issues and social context variables influencing lifestyle behaviors--specifically diet and physical activity--of southern African-American women with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted 10 focus group interviews with 70 southern African-American women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Group interviews were audiotaped and transcripts were coded using qualitative data analysis software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A panel of reviewers analyzed the coded responses for emerging themes and trends </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The dominant and most consistent themes that emerged from these focus groups were 1) spirituality as an important factor in general health, disease adjustment, and coping; 2) general life stress and multi-caregiving responsibilities interfering with daily disease management; and 3) the impact of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> manifested in feelings of dietary deprivation, physical and emotional "tiredness," "worry," and fear of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that influences on <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-management behaviors of African-American women may be best understood from a sociocultural and family context </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interventions to improve self-management for this population should recognize the influences of spirituality, general life stress, multi-caregiving responsibilities, and the psychological impact of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that family-centered and church-based approaches to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care interventions are appropriate </plain></SENT>
