<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent attention has been drawn to the close association between obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnoea</z:hpo> (OSA) and type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Debate has included much discussion about cause and effect with mechanisms proposed whereby one condition might cause the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, both clearly share a common phenotype, namely, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> that overlaps considerably with the other components of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020473" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperlipidaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It would therefore appear likely that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> are manifestations of the same basic pathological processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Possible interacting aetiological mechanisms are reviewed along with treatment options </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A recent report by the International <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Federation has made recommendations to raise awareness of possible OSA in patients with T2DM and also for screening for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020473" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperlipidaemia</z:e> and T2DM in patients with known OSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The clinical implications are discussed </plain></SENT>
