<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We investigated the region in a young genetically isolated population by genotyping 34 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 78 case subjects and 101 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two SNPs were selected and followed up in two cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first cohort came from a general Dutch population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this cohort, association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was investigated using 616 type 2 diabetic case subjects and 2,890 control subjects; association with oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test data was performed in 361 normoglycemic people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Association with fat distribution was studied in the second replication cohort, consisting of 836 people from the genetically isolated population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At the initial step, we found that the common C allele of SNP rs3745012 was associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (odds ratio 2.01, P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This SNP is located at the 3' untranslated region of the LPIN2 gene, which is a plausible candidate for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the cohort from the general Dutch population, we demonstrated that rs3745012 interacts with BMI in determination of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>: whereas in subjects with high BMI, the common C allele is associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the same allele exhibits a neutral or protective effect in lean subjects (P = 0.05 overall effect, P = 0.02 interaction) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most remarkably, rs3745012 strongly affected composite insulin sensitivity index (P = 0.006 for overall effect, P = 0.004 for interaction) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the second replication cohort, we found that the allele C of rs3745012 increases trunk-to-legs fat mass ratio (P = 0.001) and may affect other fat-related measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: rs3745012 SNP of the LPIN2 gene is associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and fat distribution </plain></SENT>
