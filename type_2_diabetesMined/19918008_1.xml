<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A regression equation incorporating postprandial time and a random plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was used to screen 800 adults in Honduras </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with a probability of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> of &gt; or =20% were asked to return for a fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A random fifth of those with a screener-based probability of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> &lt;20% were also asked to return for follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The gold standard was an FPG &gt; or =126 mg/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The screener had very good test characteristics (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.89) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using the screening criterion of &gt; or =0.42, the equation had a sensitivity of 74.1% and specificity of 97.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This screener is a valid measure of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk in Honduras and could be used to identify diabetic patients in poor clinics in Latin America </plain></SENT>
