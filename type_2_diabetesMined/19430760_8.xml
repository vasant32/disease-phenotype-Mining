<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A two-stage genome-wide association scan (GWAS) was performed in IRAS FS Hispanic-American samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the first stage, 317K single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were assessed in 229 Hispanic-American DNA samples from 34 families from San Antonio, TX, USA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SNPs with the most significant associations with AIRg were genotyped in the entire set of IRAS FS Hispanic-American samples (n = 1,190) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In chromosomal regions with evidence of association, additional SNPs were genotyped to capture variation in genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No individual SNP achieved genome-wide levels of significance (p &lt; 5 x 10(-7)); however, two regions (chromosomes 6p21 and 20p11) had multiple highly ranked SNPs that were associated with AIRg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additional genotyping in these regions supported the initial evidence of variants contributing to variation in AIRg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One region resides in a gene desert between PXT1 and KCTD20 on 6p21, while the region on 20p11 has several viable candidate genes (ENTPD6, PYGB, GINS1 and RP4-691N24.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: A GWAS in Hispanic-American samples identified several candidate genes and loci that may be associated with AIRg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These associations explain a small component of variation in AIRg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The genes identified are involved in phosphorylation and ion transport, and provide preliminary evidence that these processes are important in beta cell response </plain></SENT>
