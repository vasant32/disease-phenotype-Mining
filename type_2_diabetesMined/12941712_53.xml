<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of the lifestyle and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> interventions relative to the placebo intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Analyses were performed from a health system perspective that considered direct medical costs only and a societal perspective that considered direct medical costs, direct nonmedical costs, and indirect costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analyses were performed with the interventions as implemented in the DPP and as they might be implemented in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The lifestyle and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> interventions required more resources than the placebo intervention from a health system perspective, and over 3 years they cost approximately US dollars 2250 more per participant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As implemented in the DPP and from a societal perspective, the lifestyle and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> interventions cost US dollars 24400 and US dollars 34500, respectively, per case of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> delayed or prevented and US dollars 51600 and US dollars 99200 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As the interventions might be implemented in routine clinical practice and from a societal perspective, the lifestyle and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> interventions cost US dollars 13200 and US dollars 14300, respectively, per case of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> delayed or prevented and US dollars 27100 and US dollars 35000 per QALY gained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>From a health system perspective, costs per case of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> delayed or prevented and costs per QALY gained tended to be lower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Over 3 years, the lifestyle and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> interventions were effective and were cost-effective from the perspective of a health system and society </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both interventions are likely to be affordable in routine clinical practice, especially if implemented in a group format and with generic medication pricing </plain></SENT>
