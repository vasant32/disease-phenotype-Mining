<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the underlying cellular mechanisms contributing to the pathogenesis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> remain uncharacterized </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We postulated that the documented stimulatory effects of LC-CoAs on KATP channels might be enhanced in polymorphic KATP channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patch-clamp experiments were performed on inside-out patches containing recombinant KATP channels (Kir6.2/SUR1) to record macroscopic currents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>KATP channels containing Kir6.2 (E23K/I337V) showed significantly increased activity in response to physiological <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15525">palmitoyl-CoA</z:chebi> concentrations (100-1,000 nmol/l) compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> KATP channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At physiological intracellular ATP concentrations (mmol/l), E23K/I337V polymorphic KATP channels demonstrated significantly enhanced activity in response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15525">palmitoyl-CoA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The observed increase in KATP channel activity may result in multiple defects in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis, including impaired insulin and glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 secretion and increased glucagon release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In summary, these results suggest that the E23K/I337V polymorphism may have a diabetogenic effect via increased KATP channel activity in response to endogenous levels of LC-CoAs in tissues involved in the maintenance of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis </plain></SENT>
