<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a group-randomized, controlled clinical trial evaluating the practical effectiveness of a multicomponent intervention (TRANSLATE) in 24 practices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The intervention included implementation of an electronic <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> registry, visit reminders, and patient-specific physician alerts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A site coordinator facilitated previsit planning and a monthly review of performance with a local physician champion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The principle outcomes were the percentage of patients achieving target values for the composite of systolic blood pressure (SBP) &lt;130 mmHg, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> &lt;100 mg/dl, and A1C &lt;7.0% at baseline and 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six process measures were also followed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over 24 months, 69,965 visits from 8,405 adult patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were recorded from 238 health care providers in 24 practices from 17 health systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> process measures increased significantly more in intervention than in control practices, giving net increases as follows: foot examinations 35.0% (P &lt; 0.0.001); annual eye examinations 25.9% (P &lt; 0.001); renal testing 28.5% (P &lt; 0.001); A1C testing 8.1%(P &lt; 0.001); blood pressure monitoring 3.5% (P = 0.05); and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> testing 8.6% (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean A1C adjusted for age, sex, and comorbidity decreased significantly in intervention practices (P &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 12 months, intervention practices had significantly greater improvement in achieving recommended clinical values for SBP, A1C, and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> than control clinics (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Introduction of a multicomponent organizational intervention in the primary care setting significantly increases the percentage of type 2 diabetic patients achieving recommended clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
