<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pharmacokinetics of short-acting insulin analogs were established by assessing injection of small doses in lean subjects, healthy or with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients, however, daily dosages are larger and ATBF is decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study assessed the kinetics of a short-acting insulin analog in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Euglycemic clamps after subcutaneous lispro injections were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six healthy control subjects received 10 units </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (BMI 38.3 Â± 7.0 kg/m(2)) subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> received 10, 30, and 50 units </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasma lispro was measured by specific radioimmunoassay and ATBF by the (133)Xe-washout technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ATBF was 64% lower in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After 10 units injection, time to lispro plasma peak (T(max)) was similar (48.3 vs. 55.7 min; control subjects versus type 2 diabetic subjects), although maximal concentration (C(max))/dose was 41% lower in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, with lower and delayed maximal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion rate (GIR(max): 9.0 vs. 0.6 mg/kg/min, P &lt; 0.0001, 69 vs. 130 min, P &lt; 0.0001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After 30- and 50-unit injections, T(max) (88.6 and 130.0 min, respectively) and time to GIR(max) (175 and 245 min) were further delayed and dose related (r(2) = 0.51, P = 0.0004 and r(2) = 0.76, P &lt; 0.0001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Absorption and hypoglycemic action of increasing dosages of lispro are critically delayed in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
