<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">Glycogen</z:chebi> synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) can negatively regulate several aspects of insulin signaling, and elevated levels of GSK-3 have been reported in skeletal muscle from diabetic rodents and humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A limited amount of information is available regarding the utility of highly selective inhibitors of GSK-3 for the modification of insulin action under conditions of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present investigation, we describe novel substituted <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38338">aminopyrimidine</z:chebi> derivatives that inhibit human GSK-3 potently (K(i) &lt; 10 nmol/l) with at least 500-fold selectivity against 20 other protein kinases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These low molecular weight compounds activated <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase at approximately 100 nmol/l in cultured <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi> cells transfected with the insulin receptor and in primary hepatocytes isolated from Sprague-Dawley rats, and at 500 nmol/l in isolated type 1 skeletal muscle of both lean <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> and ZDF rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is interesting that these GSK-3 inhibitors enhanced insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transport in type 1 skeletal muscle from the insulin-resistant ZDF rats but not from insulin-sensitive lean <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Single oral or subcutaneous doses of the inhibitors (30-48 mg/kg) rapidly lowered blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels and improved <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal after oral or intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> challenges in ZDF rats and db/db mice, without causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> or markedly elevating insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Collectively, our results suggest that these selective GSK-3 inhibitors may be useful as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-acting therapeutics for the treatment of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
