<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 390 elderly (&gt;or=65 years of age) outpatients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> ( 173 men and 217 women, mean age 73.0 years) were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean HbA(1c) upon entry was 6.8% (332 receiving oral hypoglycemics and/or insulin) and blood pressure upon entry was 136/74 mmHg (219 receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive drugs</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients have been followed-up for 3 years with HbA(1c) &lt;7.0% and blood pressure &lt;145/80 mmHg as targets, with mortality and an aggregate of fatal and nonfatal <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related events as end points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mortality rate and causes of mortality, as well as risk factors for mortality and morbidity, were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mortality rate, 2.9% per year, was comparable to that of the age- and sex-matched general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> was a leading cause of mortality after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By the univariate Cox proportional hazards model, only high serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> and prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were highly significant and strong risks for both end points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In those without prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive agents</z:chebi>, the incidence of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related end point based on their systolic blood pressure (SBP) quartile was U-shaped, with the nadir at the 3rd (SBP, 137-147 mmHg) and the peak at the 1st (SBP &lt;or= 125 mmHg) quartile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In well-controlled elderly diabetic subjects, there was no excessive mortality compared to the age- and sex-matched general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>Renal dysfunction</z:hpo> and prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were independent risks for mortality and morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In those without prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, a risk of too much lowering of blood pressure was suggested </plain></SENT>
