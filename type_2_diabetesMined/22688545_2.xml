<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE This study aimed to examine <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> status as a determinant for development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and deterioration of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A random sample of the general population of Copenhagen, Denmark, was taken as part of the Inter99 study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Included were 6,405 men and women aged 30-65 years at baseline (1999-2001), with 4,296 participating in the follow-up examination 5 years later (2004-2006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">Vitamin D</z:chebi> was determined at baseline as serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> was defined based on an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test and a glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA(1c)) test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Secondary outcomes included continuous markers of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS The risk of incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> associated with a 10 nmol/L increase in 25(OH)D was odds ratio (OR) 0.91 (95% CI 0.84-0.97) in crude analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The association became statistically nonsignificant after adjustment for confounders, with an OR per 10 nmol/L of 0.94 (0.86-1.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Low 25(OH)D status was significantly associated with unfavorable longitudinal changes in continuous markers of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis after adjustment for confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fasting and 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin as well as the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> increased significantly more during follow-up among those with low 25(OH)D levels compared with those with higher levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS Low 25(OH)D status was not significantly associated with incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after adjustment for confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, it was significantly associated with unfavorable longitudinal changes in continuous markers of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis, indicating that low <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> status could be related to deterioration of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis </plain></SENT>
