<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The toxic form of amyloidogenic protein oligomers are distinct and smaller than amyloid fibrils and act by disrupting membranes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using antibodies that bind to toxic IAPP oligomers (but not IAPP monomers or fibrils) and a vaccination-based approach, we sought to establish whether IAPP toxic oligomers form intra- or extracellularly and whether vaccination to induce anti-toxic oligomer antibodies prevents IAPP-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in human IAPP (h-IAPP) transgenic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Pancreas was sampled from two h-IAPP transgenic mouse models and examined by immunohistochemistry for toxic oligomers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The same murine models were vaccinated with toxic oligomers of Alzheimer beta protein (AbetaP(1-40)) and anti-oligomer titers, and blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and islet pathology were monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Toxic oligomers were detected intracellularly in approximately 20-40% of h-IAPP transgenic beta-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vaccine induced high titers of anti-h-IAPP toxic oligomers in both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519606" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">transgenic models</z:e>, but beta-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was, if anything, further increased in vaccinated mice, so that neither loss of beta-cell mass nor <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was delayed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: IAPP toxic oligomers form in h-IAPP transgenic mouse models, and anti-toxic oligomer antibodies do not prevent h-IAPP-induced beta-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that prevention of h-IAPP oligomer formation may be more useful than a vaccination-based approach in the prevention of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
