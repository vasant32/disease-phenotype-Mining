<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It recently has been hypothesized that excessive activity of the inhibitor of kappaB (IkappaB)/nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB) inflammatory pathway is a mechanism underlying skeletal muscle <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it is not known whether IkappaB/NFkappaB signaling in muscle from subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is abnormal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied IkappaB/NFkappaB signaling in vastus lateralis muscle from six subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and eight matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Muscle from type 2 diabetic subjects was characterized by a 60% decrease in IkappaB beta protein abundance, an indicator of increased activation of the IkappaB/NFkappaB pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IkappaB beta abundance directly correlated with insulin-mediated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal (Rd) during a hyperinsulinemic (40 mU x m(-2) x min(-1))-euglycemic clamp (r = 0.63, P = 0.01), indicating that increased IkappaB/NFkappaB pathway activity is associated with muscle <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also investigated whether reversal of this abnormality could be a mechanism by which training improves insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In control subjects, 8 weeks of aerobic exercise training caused a 50% increase in both IkappaB alpha and IkappaB beta protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, training increased IkappaB alpha and IkappaB beta protein to levels comparable with that of control subjects, and these increments were accompanied by a 40% decrease in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha muscle content and a 37% increase in insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In summary, subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have reduced IkappaB protein abundance in muscle, suggesting excessive activity of the IkappaB/NFkappaB pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, this abnormality is reversed by exercise training </plain></SENT>
