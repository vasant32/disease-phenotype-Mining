<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine the effect of intensive versus standard glycemic control, we assessed fractures and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> as outcomes in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> (ACCORD) randomized trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: ACCORD participants were randomized to intensive or standard glycemia strategies, with an achieved median A1C of 6.4 and 7.5%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the ACCORD BONE ancillary study, fractures were assessed at 54 of the 77 ACCORD clinical sites that included 7,287 of the 10,251 ACCORD participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At annual visits, 6,782 participants were asked about <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> in the previous year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During an average follow-up of 3.8 (SD 1.3) years, 198 of 3,655 participants in the intensive glycemia and 189 of 3,632 participants in the standard glycemia group experienced at least one nonspine fracture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average rate of first nonspine fracture was 13.9 and 13.3 per 1,000 person-years in the intensive and standard groups, respectively (hazard ratio 1.04 [95% CI 0.86-1.27]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During an average follow-up of 2.0 years, 1,122 of 3,364 intensive- and 1,133 of 3,418 standard-therapy participants reported at least one fall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The average rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> was 60.8 and 55.3 per 100 person-years in the intensive and standard glycemia groups, respectively (1.10 [0.84-1.43]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Compared with standard glycemia, intensive glycemia did not increase or decrease fracture or fall risk in ACCORD </plain></SENT>
