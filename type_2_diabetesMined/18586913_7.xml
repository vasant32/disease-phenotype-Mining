<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The G319S HNF1A variant is associated with an increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the Canadian Oji-Cree population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the variant site at the 3' end of exon 4 might influence splicing and characterized <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> transcripts to investigate the mutational mechanism underlying this susceptibility to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We established lymphoblastoid cell lines from a G319S homozygote and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HNF1A transcripts were characterized in the cell lines and pancreatic tissue by sequence analysis of RT-PCR products and quantification using real-time PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Susceptibility to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> surveillance was investigated using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27641">cycloheximide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Full-length G319S <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> accounted for 24% of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> transcripts in the homozygous G319S cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A novel isoform lacking the terminal 12 bases of exon 4 was upregulated (55% of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> transcripts) compared with control cell lines (33%) and human pancreatic tissue (17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two abnormal transcripts present only in the G319S cell line included premature termination codons as a result of the inclusion of seven <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> from intron 4 or the deletion of exon 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="27641">Cycloheximide</z:chebi> treatment increased the levels of both transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The G319S variant results in the production of two abnormal transcripts and an alteration in the relative balance of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> splicing products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This is predicted to lead to a reduction in total HNF1A transcript levels, but residual hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha protein activity in G319S homozygotes may still reach up to 66% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A combination of abnormal splicing and reduced activity of the G319S protein may explain the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility </plain></SENT>
