<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to characterize their metabolic phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 305 nondiabetic offspring of type 2 diabetic patients was consecutively recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Insulin secretion was assessed using both indexes derived from oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) and intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (IVGTT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity was measured by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with individuals with a 1-h postload plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &lt;155 mg/dL (NGT 1h-low), NGT 1h-high individuals exhibited lower insulin sensitivity after adjustment for age, sex, and BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Insulin secretion estimated from the OGTT did not differ between the two groups of individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By contrast, compared with NGT 1h-low individuals, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin response during an IVGTT and the disposition index were significantly reduced in NGT 1h-high individuals after adjustment for age, sex, and BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Incretin effect, estimated as the ratio between total insulin responses during OGTT and IVGTT, was higher in NGT 1h-high individuals compared with NGT 1h-low individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: NGT 1h-high individuals may represent an intermediate state of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> between NGT and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and reduced β-cell function, the two main pathophysiological defects responsible for the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Postload <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> is the result of an intrinsic β-cell defect rather than impaired incretin effect </plain></SENT>
