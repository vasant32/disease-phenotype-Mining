<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To forecast the number of U.S. individuals aged &lt;20 years with type 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T1DM) or type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) through 2050, accounting for changing demography and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used Markov modeling framework to generate yearly forecasts of the number of individuals in each of three states (<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, no <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used 2001 prevalence and 2002 incidence of T1DM and T2DM from the SEARCH for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> in Youth study and U.S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Census Bureau population demographic projections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two scenarios were considered for T1DM and T2DM incidence: 1) constant incidence over time; 2) for T1DM yearly percentage increases of 3.5, 2.2, 1.8, and 2.1% by age-groups 0-4 years, 5-9 years, 10-14 years, and 15-19 years, respectively, and for T2DM a yearly 2.3% increase across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Under scenario 1, the projected number of youth with T1DM rises from 166,018 to 203,382 and with T2DM from 20,203 to 30,111, respectively, in 2010 and 2050 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Under scenario 2, the number of youth with T1DM nearly triples from 179,388 in 2010 to 587,488 in 2050 (prevalence 2.13/1,000 and 5.20/1,000 [+144% increase]), with the greatest increase in youth of minority racial/ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The number of youth with T2DM almost quadruples from 22,820 in 2010 to 84,131 in 2050; prevalence increases from 0.27/1,000 to 0.75/1,000 (+178% increase) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A linear increase in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence could result in a substantial increase in the number of youth with T1DM and T2DM over the next 40 years, especially those of minority race/ethnicity </plain></SENT>
