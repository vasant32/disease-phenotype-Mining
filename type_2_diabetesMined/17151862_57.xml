<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These disorders are associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and animal models suggest that BDNF plays a role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore explored whether BDNF plays a role in human <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We included (Study 1) 233 humans divided into four groups depending on presence or absence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and presence or absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>; and (Study 2) seven healthy volunteers who underwent both a hyperglycaemic and a hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Plasma levels of BDNF in Study 1 were decreased in humans with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> independently of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma BDNF was inversely associated with fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, but not with insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No association was found between the BDNF G196A (Val66Met) polymorphism and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In Study 2 an output of BDNF from the human brain was detected at basal conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This output was inhibited when blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were elevated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, when plasma insulin was increased while maintaining <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, the cerebral output of BDNF was not inhibited, indicating that high levels of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, but not insulin, inhibit the output of BDNF from the human brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Low levels of BDNF accompany impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Decreased BDNF may be a pathogenetic factor involved not only in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, but also in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, potentially explaining the clustering of these conditions in epidemiological studies </plain></SENT>
