<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="15351">Acetyl-CoA</z:chebi> carboxylase 2 (ACC2) is a key regulatory enzyme controlling skeletal muscle <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> fatty acid oxidation; inhibition of ACC2 results in enhanced oxidation of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several mouse models lacking functional ACC2 have been reported in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the phenotypes of the different models are inconclusive with respect to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis and protection from diet-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Here, we studied the effects of pharmacological inhibition of ACC2 using as a selective inhibitor the S enantiomer of compound 9c ([S]-9c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Selectivity was confirmed in biochemical assays using purified human ACC1 and ACC2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (S)-9c significantly increased fatty acid oxidation in isolated extensor digitorum longus muscle from different mouse models (EC(50) 226 nmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, short-term treatment of mice with (S)-9c decreased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15531">malonyl-CoA</z:chebi> levels in skeletal muscle and concomitantly reduced intramyocellular <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment of db/db mice for 70 days with (S)-9c (10 and 30 mg/kg, by oral gavage) resulted in improved oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (AUC -36%, p &lt; 0.05), enhanced skeletal muscle 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]fluoro-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4167">D-glucose</z:chebi> (FDG) uptake, as well as lowered prandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (-31%, p &lt; 0.01) and HbA(1c) (-0.7%, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Body weight, liver triacylglycerol, plasma insulin and pancreatic insulin content were unaffected by the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In conclusion, the ACC2-selective inhibitor (S)-9c revealed <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering effects in a mouse model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
