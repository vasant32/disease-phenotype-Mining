<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Since occupation, a major socio-economic factor, may be a risk factor for type-2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM), we compared DM incidence among four groups of white-collar workers in a follow-up study in 13,547 Japanese men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The subjects aged 30-59 years and free from DM at baseline consisted of: (a) 3725 clerical, (b) 5575 technical/professional, (c) 3474 manager/administrative and (d) 774 sales workers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Incident DM was identified by 'fasting serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &gt;or=7.00 mmol/l' or 'under medical treatment for DM' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for incident DM were estimated using clerical workers as the reference group (HR=1.00) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Baseline age, body mass index (BMI), drinking, smoking, exercise and education were computed as confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During mean follow-up periods of 7.4 years, 176 clerical, 264 technical/professional, 195 manager/administrative and 49 sales workers developed DM (6.0, 6.1, 8.8 and 9.4 per 1000 person-years, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sales workers aged 40-49 and 50-59 years had increased multivariate-adjusted HRs (95% CIs) of 1.55 (1.02, 2.35) and 2.01 (0.98, 4.10), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Manager/administrative workers aged 50-59 years had an increased crude HR (95% CI) of 1.64 (1.02, 2.63), but the significance disappeared after BMI-adjustment (HR (95% CI: 1.46 (0.91, 2.35)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Technical/professional workers had no significant HR in any model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, sales workers in Japan aged &gt;or=40 years may have increased risk for DM (+55 to +100%) independent of BMI, lifestyles and education, and manager/administrative workers aged &gt;or=50 years may have increased risk (about +65%) due to their large BMI </plain></SENT>
