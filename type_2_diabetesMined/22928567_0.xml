<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> is characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> with a relative deficiency in insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has become apparent that inter-organ communication is of great importance in the pathophysiology of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Far from being an inert tissue in terms of inter-organ communication, it is now recognized that skeletal muscle can secrete so-called myokines that can impact on the function of distant organs/tissues both favourably and unfavourably </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have proposed that communication between insulin-resistant skeletal muscle and β-cells occurs in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This is a novel route of communication that we further suggest is modified by the prevailing degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> of skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This review focuses on the various myokines [interleukin-6 (IL-6), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-α, CXCL10, follistatin and IL-8] which have been identified either after different types of exercise or in the secretome from control and insulin-resistant human skeletal myotubes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We will also summarize studies on the impact of several myokines on pancreatic β-cell proliferation, survival and function </plain></SENT>
