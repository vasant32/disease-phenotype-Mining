<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In middle-aged subjects, elevated plasma proinsulin has been found to predict type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, our aim was to study the longitudinal relationships between baseline determinations of insulin sensitivity index (S(i)) assessed by euglycemic insulin clamp, the early insulin response (EIR) at an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT), fasting intact proinsulin, 32-33 split proinsulin and specific insulin, and the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a population-based cohort of 70-year-old nondiabetic men (n = 667) with 7-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A euglycemic insulin clamp study and a 75-g OGTT were performed at baseline, and fasting <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> concentrations were measured using specific two-site immunometric assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results from logistic regression models are presented as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs for a 1-SD increase in the predictor variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In separate multivariate analyses adjusted for EIR (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.59-0.89) and S(i) (0.68, 0.58-0.88), 32-33 split proinsulin (1.49, 1.18-1.88) or intact proinsulin (1.30, 1.04-1.63) were significantly associated with the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, whereas specific insulin (1.24, 0.91-1.66) was not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The significant associations between 32-33 split or intact proinsulin and the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were unaltered after adjustment for BMI and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Insulin propeptides predicted type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> over a 7-year period in elderly men, independent of the EIR and S(i) </plain></SENT>
