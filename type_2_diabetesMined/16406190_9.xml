<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The data regarding comparison of efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi>, newest <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">Sulfonylurea</z:chebi>, or with the use of both drugs in combination with insulin is rare in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we assessed the daily insulin dose, hypoglycemic events and body weight on achieving desirable glycemic control after addition of insulin, to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> 8 mg and/or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> 2500 mg, in subjects with type 2 DM manifesting lapse of glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: S.C. insulin Novolog Mix [70/30], pre-supper was initiated in 12 subjects on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, 14 subjects on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi>, and 12 subjects receiving both drugs, with HbA1C &gt; 7.5% and eight subjects receiving placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Insulin dose was increased by 4 U at weekly interval until fasting blood sugar [FBS] between 6.6 and 8 mM/l was attained and then further titrated by 2 U every week to attain and maintain FBS between 4.5 and 6.7 mM/l over the next 4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The comparisons were conducted between these groups for HbA1C, the daily insulin dose, body weight noted at the end of this study period as well as the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001988'>hypoglycemic episodes</z:hpo> per patient during the last 4 weeks of the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HbA1C levels were &lt; 7.0% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects at the end of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The daily insulin dose (units), total and per kg/BW was significantly lower [p &lt; 0.001] with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (51 +/- 5, 0.51 +/- 0.10), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> (40 +/- 4, 0.42 +/- 0.09) as well as with both drugs (23 +/- 7, 0.21 +/- 0.07) in comparison to placebo (82 +/- 10, 0.82 +/- 0.12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The insulin dose was also significantly lower [p &lt; 0.05] in subjects on both drugs than subjects receiving them individually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>Weight gain</z:mp> was less [p &lt; 0.001] with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> [2.5 +/- 0.74 kg], <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> [2.3 +/- 0.7 kg], and both drugs [2.2 +/- 0.61 kg] in comparison to placebo [5.2 +/- 1.4 kg] whereas the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001988'>hypoglycemic episodes</z:hpo> were lesser with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (3.8 +/- 1.2) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> (3.3 +/- 0.9) and least with both drugs (2.5 +/- 0.6) in comparison to placebo (5.2 +/- 1.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">Glimepiride</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> are effective individually in achieving a glycemic goal with a less daily insulin dose, <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001988'>hypoglycemic episodes</z:hpo> in comparison to insulin monotherapy in subjects with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> with further marked reduction in these parameters when used concurrently </plain></SENT>
