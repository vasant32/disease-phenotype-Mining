<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate whether there is an interaction between birthweight and common variants in the TCF7L2, HHEX, PPARG, KCNJ11, SLC30A8, IGF2BP2, CDKAL1, CDKN2A/2B and JAZF1 genes in the risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 2,003 participants from the Helsinki Birth Cohort Study, 311 of whom were diagnosed with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by an OGTT, were genotyped for the specified variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Indices for insulin sensitivity and secretion were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>Low birthweight</z:hpo> was associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (p = 0.008) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948379" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">impaired insulin secretion</z:e> (p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the tested variants, the risk variant in HHEX showed a trend towards a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birthweight</z:hpo> (p = 0.09) and the risk variant in the CDKN2A/2B locus was associated with high birthweight (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The TCF7L2 risk allele was associated with increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pooling across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> nine genes, each risk allele increased the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by 14% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>[corrected] Risk variants in the HHEX, CDKN2A/2B and JAZF1 genes interacted with birthweight, so that the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was highest in those with lower birthweight (p &lt;or= 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The interaction was also present in the pooled data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>Low birthweight</z:hpo> might affect the strength of the association of some common variants (HHEX, CDKN2A/2B and JAZF1) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings need to be replicated in independent cohorts </plain></SENT>
