<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MCIDs for each PedsQL module were calculated using one standard error of measurement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Demographic and clinical characteristics associated with QOL change were identified through multiple linear and logistic regression analyses.RESULTSThe sample comprised 5,004 youth (mean age, 12.5 ± 4.7 years; mean <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration, 3.4 ± 3.7 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 100 possible points, PedsQL total score MCIDs for youth with type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, respectively, were Generic Core, 4.88, 6.27 (parent); 4.72, 5.41 (youth); <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Module, 4.54, 6.06 (parent); 5.27, 5.96 (youth) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among 1,402 youth with a follow-up visit, lower baseline QOL, male sex, private insurance, having type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, longer <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration, and better glycemic control predicted improvements in youth- and parent-reported PedsQL total scores over 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinically meaningful (≥1 MCID) improvements in total score for at least one PedsQL module were predicted by private insurance, lower BMI, and lower A1C at baseline.CONCLUSIONSThese <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-specific reference points to interpret clinically meaningful change in PedsQL scores can be used in clinical care and research for youth with type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
