<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Strategies to prevent postpartum type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are important to reduce the epidemic of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and its societal impact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Breastfeeding was reported to improve early postpartum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance and reduce the subsequent risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To investigate whether breastfeeding influences short- and long-term postpartum <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> outcomes, women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> (n = 304) participating in the prospective German <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> study were followed from delivery for up to 19 years postpartum for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants were recruited between 1989 and 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postpartum <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> developed in 147 women and was dependent on the treatment received during pregnancy (insulin vs. diet), BMI, and presence/absence of islet autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among islet autoantibody-negative women, breastfeeding was associated with median time to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> of 12.3 years compared with 2.3 years in women who did not breastfeed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The lowest postpartum <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk was observed in women who breastfed for &gt;3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the basis of these results, we recommend that breastfeeding should be encouraged among these women because it offers a safe and feasible low-cost intervention to reduce the risk of subsequent <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in this high-risk population </plain></SENT>
