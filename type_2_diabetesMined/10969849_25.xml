<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, a K121Q polymorphism in the human PC-1 gene was found in a Sicilian population and was shown to be strongly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objectives of the present investigation were to examine in the Danish Caucasian population whether the K121Q variant was associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or, in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-tolerant subjects, with impaired whole-body insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We genotyped 404 Danish type 2 diabetic patients and found that the allele frequency of the variant was 0.14 (95% CI 0.12-0.16), whereas the allele frequency was 0.16 (95% CI 0.13-0.19) among 237 matched <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-tolerant control subjects (P = 0.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the control subjects, there were no significant differences among <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp>, heterozygous, or homozygous subjects in regard to 1) serum insulin and plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels at fasting, 60 min, or 120 min during an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) or 2) the estimates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> obtained from the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we investigated the impact of the variant in 2 other Danish population samples that comprised 356 young healthy subjects and 226 glucose-tolerant offspring of type 2 diabetic probands, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the study populations, the polymorphism was not associated with an altered insulin sensitivity index as estimated from an intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test in combination with an intravenous injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27999">tolbutamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, among the 226 offspring, the variations in serum insulin and serum C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> responses measured during an OGTT were not related to the PC-1 genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the K121Q polymorphism of the human PC-1 gene is not associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> among Danish Caucasians </plain></SENT>
