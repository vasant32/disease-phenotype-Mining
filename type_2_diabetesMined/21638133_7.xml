<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Random samples of individuals (n = 66,320) from 20 general practices were invited for a 75 g OGTT and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ten-year <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk among screen-detected people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> regulation (IGR) (impaired fasting glycaemia and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> [IGT]) was computed using the Framingham-based ETHRISK engine and achievable risk reduction was predicted using relative reductions for treatments extracted from published trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 6,041 participants (48% male, 22% south Asian) aged 40-75 years inclusive were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Undiagnosed <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disorders occurred more frequently in south Asians than white Europeans; age and sex adjusted odds ratios were 1.74 (95% CI 1.42-2.13) and 2.30 (95% CI 1.68-3.16) for IGT and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of any undetected <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disorder was 17.5% in the whole cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adjusted 10-year risk was similar in screen-detected people with IGR and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (18.3% vs 21.6%), and was higher in south Asians across the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> spectrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Absolute <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk reductions of up to 13% in those with screen-detected type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 6% in IGR are achievable using existing cardioprotective therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Population screening with an OGTT identifies a significant burden of modifiable <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk, especially within south Asian groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Strategies enticing this population to consider screening programmes are urgently needed as significant risk reduction is possible once a <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> abnormality is identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00318032 </plain></SENT>
