<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The sample consisted of 4,381 black and white young adults examined repeatedly from 1985 to 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used the 2005 Diet Quality Index (DQI) to rate participants' diets based on meeting key dietary recommendations conveyed by the 2005 DGA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, we found no association between DQI score and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk using Cox models adjusted for potential confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Higher DQI scores were associated with favorable changes in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> and blood pressure overall (P for trend &lt; 0.05), but with increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> among blacks (P for trend &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the need for evaluation of the DGA's effectiveness, particularly among ethnic minority populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinicians should be aware that following the DGA might not lower <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
