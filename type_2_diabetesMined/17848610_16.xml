<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We aimed to update the epidemiology of type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients among the incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e>) population in Australia and New Zealand (ANZ) and to determine whether outcome is worse for diabetic women, as described in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGNS AND METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> resident adults of ANZ who began renal replacement therapy (RRT) from 1 April 1991 to 31 December 2005 were included using data from the ANZ Dialysis and Transplant Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Incidence rates, RRT, and survival were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were assessed using Cox regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study included 1,284 type 1 diabetic (4.5%), 8,560 type 2 diabetic (30.0%), and 18,704 nondiabetic (65.5%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e> with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> increased markedly over time (+10.2% annually, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients aged &lt;70 years, rates of renal transplantation in type 1 diabetic, type 2 diabetic, and nondiabetic patients were 41.8, 6.5 (P &lt; 0.0001 vs. other patients), and 40.9% (P = 0.56 vs. type 1 diabetic patients), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with nondiabetic patients, the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was 1.64 (P &lt; 0.0001) in type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 1.13 (P &lt; 0.0001) in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Survival rates per 5-year period improved by 6% in type 1 diabetic patients (P = 0.36), by 9% in type 2 diabetic patients (P &lt; 0.0001), and by 5% in nondiabetic patients (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In type 2 diabetic patients aged &gt;or=60 years, the adjusted HR for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in women versus men was 1.19 (P = 0.0003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e> with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> increased markedly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Despite high access to renal transplants, type 1 diabetic patients had a poor prognosis after starting RRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Survival improved significantly in type 2 diabetic patients during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Older type 2 diabetic women had a worse prognosis than older type 2 diabetic men </plain></SENT>
