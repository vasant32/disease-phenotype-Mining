<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 1,333 eligible members of a large not-for-profit health maintenance organization who responded to a 1997 survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We tested associations among demographic, treatment, and psychometric variables with mean 1997 HbA1c values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Problem Areas in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> (PAID) instrument was used to assess the emotional effect of living with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and the Short Form 12 Physical Function Scale was used to assess the effect of physical limitations on daily activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on differences between and within treatment groups, we built models to predict glycemic control for subgroups of subjects who were using insulin alone and those who were using insulin in combination with an oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agent</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Younger age, lower BMI, and increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0700361" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">emotional distress</z:e> about <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (according to the PAID scale) were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significant predictors (P &lt; 0.05) of worse glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, except among individuals with an HbA1c level of &gt;8.0 who were receiving combination therapy, only approximately 10% of the variance in glycemic control could be predicted by demographic, treatment, or psychometric characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Personal characteristics explain little of the variation in glycemic control in insulin-using adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Possible explanations are that the reduced complexity of control in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> makes the disease less sensitive to personal factors than control in type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, that health-related behavior is less driven by personal and environmental characteristics among older individuals, or that, in populations exposed to aggressive glycemic control with oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi> and nurse care managers, personal differences become largely irrelevant </plain></SENT>
