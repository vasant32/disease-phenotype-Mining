<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in either the Kir6.2 or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> receptor (SUR) 1 subunit of the channel have previously been shown to cause neonatal <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe here an activating mutation in the ABCC8 gene, encoding SUR1, that is associated with the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> only in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Recombinant K(ATP) channel subunits were expressed using pIRES2-based vectors in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 or INS1(832/13) cells and the subcellular distribution of c-myc-tagged SUR1 channels analyzed by confocal microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>K(ATP) channel activity was measured in inside-out patches and plasma membrane potential in perforated whole-cell patches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cytoplasmic [Ca(2+)] was imaged using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52080">Fura-Red</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A mutation in ABCC8/SUR1, leading to a Y356C substitution in the seventh membrane-spanning alpha-helix, was observed in a patient diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> at age 39 years and in two adult offspring with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948379" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">impaired insulin secretion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Single K(ATP) channels incorporating SUR1-Y356C displayed lower sensitivity to MgATP (IC(50) = 24 and 95 micromol/l for <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and mutant channels, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similar effects were observed in the absence of Mg(2+), suggesting an allosteric effect via associated Kir6.2 subunits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of SUR1-Y356C in INS1(832/13) cells impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced cell depolarization and increased in intracellular free Ca(2+) concentration, albeit more weakly than neonatal <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-associated SUR1 mutants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: An ABCC8/SUR1 mutation with relatively minor effects on K(ATP) channel activity and beta-cell <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> sensing causes <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data suggest a close correlation between altered SUR1 properties and clinical phenotype </plain></SENT>
