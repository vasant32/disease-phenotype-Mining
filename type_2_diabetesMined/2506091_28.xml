<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="?"><plain>Which therapy should be used in Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetic patients with "secondary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> failure", insulin or a combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To address this question, we have compared the effect of 6 months of insulin therapy twice daily with that of a combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> in 24 Type 2 diabetic subjects, who no longer responded to treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both treatments resulted in an equivalent 30% improvement in mean daily blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (p less than 0.001), without significant effect on serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Insulin improved glycaemic control primarily by reducing basal hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production (p less than 0.05), but had no significant effect on peripheral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> enhanced significantly total body <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism (p less than 0.05), predominantly by stimulating the non-oxidative pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neither insulin nor the combination therapy altered B-cell response to a test meal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Insulin therapy resulted in a 6% increase in body weight, 63% of which was accounted for by increased fat mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although body weight was unchanged during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> therapy, lean body mass and energy expenditure decreased significantly (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that insulin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> have different long-term effects on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and energy metabolism in Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
