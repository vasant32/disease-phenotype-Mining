<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This study was a randomized, controlled, single-blind, crossover trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four participants with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (mean age 58 years; 14 women and 10 men) were randomly assigned to one of the two possible sequence permutations to receive an ad libitum diet enriched with 56 g (366 kcal) walnuts/day and an ad libitum diet without walnuts for 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects underwent endothelial function testing (measured as flow-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> [FMD]) and assessment of cardiovascular biomarkers before and after each 8-week treatment phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome measure was the change in FMD after 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Secondary outcome measures included changes in plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, A1C, fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin sensitivity, and anthropometric measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Endothelial function significantly improved after consumption of a walnut-enriched ad libitum diet compared with that after consumption of an ad libitum diet without walnuts (2.2 +/- 1.7 vs. 1.2 +/- 1.6%; P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The walnut-enriched diet increased fasting serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and lowered serum total cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> from baseline (10.0 +/- 20.5 mg/dl, P = 0.04; -9.7 +/- 14.5 mg/dl, P &lt; 0.01; and -7.7 +/- 10 mg/dl, P &lt; 0.01, respectively), although these changes were not significant compared with those for an ad libitum diet without walnuts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no significant changes in anthropometric measures, plasma A1C, and insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A walnut-enriched ad libitum diet improves endothelium-dependent vasodilatation in type 2 diabetic individuals, suggesting a potential reduction in overall cardiac risk </plain></SENT>
