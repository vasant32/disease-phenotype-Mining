<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Prevention of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> (SH) is premised partially on the ability to accurately anticipate its occurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study prospectively tests methods for predicting SH using blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> meter readings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: One hundred adults with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were followed for 6 months, and 79 insulin-using adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were followed for 4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During this time, subjects' routine self-monitored blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (SMBG) readings were stored on and retrieved from memory meters, and participants were queried biweekly about occurrence of SH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Respective demographics for the two groups were age 40.7 and 50.2 years, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> 20.0 and 12.2 years, A1C 7.6 and 8.8%, and male sex 43 and 39%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Relative risk for SH, quantified by the ratio of an individual's low blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> index (LBGI) based on the previous 150 SMBG readings to the LBGI based on recent SMBG readings, increased significantly in the 24 h before SH episodes in individuals with type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (t = 10.3, P &lt; 0.0001, and t = 4.2, P &lt; 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A sliding algorithm detected 58% of imminent (within 24 h) SH episodes in the type 1 diabetic group and 60% of those in the type 2 diabetic group when three SMBG readings were available in the 24 h before an episode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Detection increased to 63 and 75%, respectively, if five SMBG readings were available in the 24 h before an episode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SH often follows a specific blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> fluctuation pattern that is identifiable from SMBG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, partial prediction of imminent SH is possible, providing a potential tool to trigger self-regulatory prevention of significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
