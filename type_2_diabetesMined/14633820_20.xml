<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In vivo data in rodents suggest that the insulin-sensitization responsible for improvement of glycemia occurs in muscle and liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whereas associations of plasma adiponectin with muscle insulin sensitivity in humans have been examined, this has not been done for the liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We therefore analyzed the relationship between fasting plasma adiponectin and basal endogenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production [EGP]-basal) and insulin-suppressed EGP (EGP-insulin, isotope dilution technique) in 143 Pima Indians (94 with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, 36 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo>, and 16 with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fasting plasma adiponectin concentrations were negatively correlated with EGP-basal and EGP-insulin before (P = 0.006 and P &lt; 0.0001, respectively) as well as after adjustment for age, sex, percent body fat, and insulin-stimulated whole-body <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake (P = 0.007 and P = 0.0005, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings are compatible with the hypothesis that adiponectin increases hepatic insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Consistent with data in animals, adiponectin may have generalized insulin-sensitizing effects in humans </plain></SENT>
