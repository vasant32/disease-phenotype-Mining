<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore investigated relationships between serum bioavailable <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> concentration and the ratio of glycated albumin (GA) to A1C and between serum bioavailable <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentrations in men with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The above relationships were investigated in 222 consecutive men with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also investigated how the ratio of GA to A1C is related to other variables such as age, BMI, and degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025945" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic microangiopathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean ratio of GA to A1C was 2.94 +/- 0.38 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum bioavailable <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> concentration correlated positively with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration (r = 0.368, P &lt; 0.0001) and negatively with the ratio of GA to A1C (r = -0.278, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multiple regression analyses identified serum bioavailable <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> concentration (beta = 0.187, P = 0.0062), age (beta = -0.204, P = 0.0075), BMI (beta = 0.151, P = 0.0302), systolic blood pressure (beta = 0.173, P = 0.0090), and plasma total cholesterol (beta = 0.155, P = 0.0141) as independent determinants of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration; moreover, serum bioavailable <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> concentration (beta = -0.155, P = 0.0381) and plasma total cholesterol (beta = -0.170, P = 0.0144) were identified as independent determinants of the ratio of GA to A1C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Serum bioavailable <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> concentration correlated positively with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration and negatively with the ratio of GA to A1C in men with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, which may lead to underestimation of A1C in hypogonadal men with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
