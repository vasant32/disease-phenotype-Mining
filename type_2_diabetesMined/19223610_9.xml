<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is no information on whether incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is predicted by blood pressure control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the hazard of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in relation to blood pressure control in treated hypertensive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Nondiabetic, otherwise healthy, hypertensive patients (N = 1,754, mean +/- SD age 52 +/- 11 years, 43% women) participated in a network over 3.4 +/- 1 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure was considered uncontrolled if systolic was &gt;or=140 mmHg and/or diastolic was &gt;or=90 mmHg at the last outpatient visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> was defined according to American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Uncontrolled blood pressure despite <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> treatment was found in 712 patients (41%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At baseline, patients with uncontrolled blood pressure were slightly younger than patients with controlled blood pressure (51 +/- 11 vs. 53 +/- 12 years, P &lt; 0.001), with no differences in sex distribution, BMI, duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, baseline blood pressure, fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile, or prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, 109 subjects developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was significantly higher in patients with uncontrolled (8%) than in those with controlled blood pressure (4%, odds ratio 2.08, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In Cox regression analysis controlling for baseline systolic blood pressure and BMI, family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and physical activity, uncontrolled blood pressure doubled the risk of incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (hazard ratio [HR] 2.10, P &lt; 0.001), independently of significant effects of age (HR 1.02 per year, P = 0.03) and baseline fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (HR 1.10 per mg/dl, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In a large sample of treated nondiabetic hypertensive subjects, uncontrolled blood pressure is associated with twofold increased risk of incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> independently of age, BMI, baseline blood pressure, or fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
