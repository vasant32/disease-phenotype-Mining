<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With the increasing numbers of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, a simple, noninvasive method is needed to detect <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Augmentation represents the difference between the second and first peaks of the central arterial pressure waveform in systole and is a measure of systemic arterial stiffness, which causes the pressure wave to rebound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether augmentation could serve as a marker of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Central arterial pressure and degree of its augmentation by pulse wave rebound were measured sphygmographically in 208 consecutive patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 117 healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relationship between augmentation and carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> detected by carotid ultrasonography was investigated in a subgroup of 81 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Augmentation was greater in diabetic patients than control subjects (13.2+/-6.9 vs. 9.4+/-5.7 mm Hg, P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The positive correlation between augmentation and intima-media thickness (r=0.309, P=0.0051) and between augmentation and plaque score (r=0.304, P=0.0059) were found in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Augmentation was greater in diabetic patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (n=47) than without (n=161; 15.1+/-8.4 vs. 12.6+/-6.3 mm Hg, P=0.031) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Augmentation of central arterial pressure is a reliable marker for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This simple, noninvasive determination would permit large-scale, early screening for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, who are at increased risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
