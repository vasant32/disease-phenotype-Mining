<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore examined whether targeting these pathways by a kidney-targeting Smad7 gene transfer has therapeutic effects on renal lesions in the db/db mouse model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We delivered Smad7 plasmids into the kidney of db/db mice using kidney-targeting, ultrasound-mediated, microbubble-inducible gene transfer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The histopathology, ultrastructural pathology and pathways of TGF-β/SMAD2/3-mediated <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> and NF-κB-dependent <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In this mouse model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, Smad7 gene therapy significantly inhibited diabetic kidney injury, compared with mice treated with empty vectors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Symptoms inhibited included: (1) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> and renal function impairment; (2) <z:mp ids='MP_0003985'>renal fibrosis</z:mp> such as <z:mp ids='MP_0005264'>glomerular sclerosis</z:mp>, tubulo-interstitial collagen matrix abundance and <z:mp ids='MP_0001859'>renal inflammation</z:mp>, including Inos (also known as Nos2), Il1b and Mcp1 (also known as Ccl2) upregulation, as well as macrophage infiltration; and (3) podocyte and endothelial cell injury as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry and/or electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further study demonstrated that the improvement of type 2 diabetic kidney injury by overexpression of Smad7 was associated with significantly inhibited local activation of the TGF-β/SMAD and NF-κB signalling pathways in the kidney </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our results clearly demonstrate that kidney-targeting Smad7 gene transfer may be an effective therapy for type 2 diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, acting via simultaneous modulation of the TGF-β/SMAD and NF-κB signalling pathways </plain></SENT>
