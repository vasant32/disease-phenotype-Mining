<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We did a cross-sectional study of 1833 non-diabetic subjects and 1895 patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, in nine centres in six Mediterranean countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A dietary questionnaire validated against the 3-Day Diet Diary was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In diabetic patients the contribution of proteins, carbohydrates and fat to the energy intake varied greatly among centres, ranging from 17.6% to 21.0% for protein, from 37.7% to 53.0% for carbohydrates and from 27.2% to 40.8% for fat, following in every centre the trends of the non-diabetic population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, diabetic patients compared to the corresponding background population had: (i). lower energy intake, (ii). lower carbohydrate and higher protein contribution to the energy intake, (iii). higher prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, ranging from 9 to 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The adherence to the nutritional recommendations for proteins, carbohydrate and fat was very low ranging from 1.4 to 23.6%, and still decreased when fibre was also considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: In diabetic patients of the Mediterranean area: (i). dietary habits vary greatly among countries, according to the same trends of the background population; (ii). the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> is much lower than the 80% reported for patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Western countries; (iii) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Carbohydrate intake is decreased with a complementary increase of protein and fat consumption, resulting to a poor compliance with the nutritional recommendations </plain></SENT>
