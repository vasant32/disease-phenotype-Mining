<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between circulating levels of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), a mesenchymal-derived pleiotrophic factor that is elevated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and the prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis among 892 postmenopausal women within the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study (WHI-OS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HGF levels positively correlated with BMI and homeostasis model assessment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the multivariable analysis comparing the highest tertile with the lowest tertile of HGF, the odds ratio for prevalent <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 2.47 (95% CI [1.12-5.47], P for trend = 0.014) after accounting for age, race, BMI, and other risk factors for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: HGF levels are associated with the presence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in postmenopausal women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Future studies should consider the prospective evaluation of the association of HGF with the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
