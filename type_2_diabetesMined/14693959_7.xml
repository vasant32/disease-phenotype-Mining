<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, a provider survey was administered in two practice-based research networks when HbA(1c) results were reviewed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> nonpregnant patients &gt;18 years old with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Univariate and Mantel-Hantel analyses assessed associations between patient characteristics and clinical decisions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 483 surveys were completed by at least 88 providers at 19 clinics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most patients were female (62.5%), mean age was 60 years, and 28.6% were Hispanic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall action rate on HbA(1c) results &gt;/=7% (n = 294) was 70.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients who were black or had Medicare without medication insurance had lower rates of action on HbA(1c) &gt;/=7 and &gt;/=8%, respectively (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most common reasons providers reported for inaction were "patient improving/doing well," "competing demands," and "hypoglycemic risk." CONCLUSIONS: Primary care providers generally adhere to national glycemic control guidelines, although there may be disparities in black patients and patients without medication insurance coverage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A variety of reasons were given when control was not intensified </plain></SENT>
