<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="3181">Bromocriptine</z:chebi> modulates neurotransmitter action in the brain and has been shown to improve <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in animal models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the effect of a quick-release <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3181">bromocriptine</z:chebi> formulation on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> type 2 diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: There were 22 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> randomized to receive a quick-release formulation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3181">bromocriptine</z:chebi> (n = 15) or placebo (n = 7) in a 16-week double-blind study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects were prescribed a weight-maintaining diet to exclude any effect of changes in body weight on the primary outcome measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration and HbA(1c) were measured at 2- to 4-week intervals during treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Body composition (underwater weighing), body fat distribution (magnetic resonance imaging), oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test [OGTT]), insulin-mediated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal, and endogenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production (2-step euglycemic insulin clamp, 40 and 160 mU x min(-1) x m(-2)) were measured before and after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No changes in body weight or body composition occurred during the study in either placebo- or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3181">bromocriptine</z:chebi>-treated subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="3181">Bromocriptine</z:chebi> significantly reduced HbA(1c) (from 8.7 to 8.1%, P = 0.009) and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (from 190 to 172 mg/dl, P = 0.02) levels, whereas these variables increased during placebo treatment (from 8.5 to 9.1%, NS, and from 187 to 223 mg/dl, P = 0.02, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The differences in HbA(1c) (delta = 1.2%, P = 0.01) and fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (delta = 54 mg/dl, P &lt; 0.001) levels between the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3181">bromocriptine</z:chebi> and placebo group at 16 weeks were highly significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration during OGTT was significantly reduced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3181">bromocriptine</z:chebi> (from 294 to 272 mg/dl, P = 0.005), whereas it increased in the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No change in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal occurred during the first step of the insulin clamp in either the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3181">bromocriptine</z:chebi>- or placebo-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>During the second insulin clamp step, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3181">bromocriptine</z:chebi> improved total <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal from 6.8 to 8.4 mg x min(-1) kg(-1) fat-free mass (FFM) (P = 0.01) and nonoxidative <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal from 3.3 to 4.3 mg min(-1) x kg(-1) FFM (P &lt; 0.05), whereas both of these variables deteriorated significantly (P &lt; or = 0.02) in the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3181">Bromocriptine</z:chebi> improves glycemic control and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Both reductions in fasting and postprandial plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels appear to contribute to the improvement in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3181">bromocriptine</z:chebi>-induced improvement in glycemic control is associated with enhanced maximally stimulated insulin-mediated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal </plain></SENT>
