<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of rapid-turnaround HbA1c results on providers' clinical decision-making and on follow-up HbA1c levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The research design was a randomized clinical trial in which rapid HbA1c results were made available to providers on even days of the month (rapid, n = 575), but delayed by 24 h on odd days (conventional, n = 563) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adjustment of therapy for patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was considered appropriate if therapy was intensified for HbA1c values &gt;7% or not intensified for HbA1c values &lt; or =7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A post-hoc analysis was also performed using patients (n = 574) who returned for follow-up 2-7 months later to ascertain the effect of rapid HbA1c availability on subsequent glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Rapid HbA1c availability resulted in more appropriate management compared with conventional HbA1c availability (79 vs. 71%, P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This difference was due mainly to less frequent intensification when HbA1c levels were &lt; or =7% (10 vs. 22%, P &lt; 0.0001) and slightly to more frequent intensification for patients with HbA1c values &gt;7% (67 vs. 63%, P = 0.33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For both groups, intensification was greatest for patients on insulin (51%) compared with patients on oral agents (35%) and diet alone (14%) (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Regression analysis confirmed that providers receiving conventional HbA1c results were more likely to intensify therapy in patients who already had HbA1c levels &lt; or =7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Over 2-7 months of follow-up, HbA1c rose more in patients with conventional HbA1c results compared with rapid results (0.8 vs. 0.4%, P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients with initial HbA1c &gt;7%, rapid HbA1c results had a favorable impact on follow-up HbA1c independent of the decision to intensify therapy (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Availability of rapid HbA1c determinations appears to facilitate <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The more favorable follow-up HbA1c profile in the rapid HbA1c group occurs independently of the decision to intensify therapy, suggesting the involvement of other factors such as enhanced provider and/or patient motivation </plain></SENT>
