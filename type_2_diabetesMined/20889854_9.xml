<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Analysis of data on 6,423 adult men and nonpregnant women aged ��20 years from Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) and 6,962 participants from the combined NHANES 1999-2006 were done </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The revised National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III definition was used to calculate MetSyn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both the unadjusted prevalence (27.9 ± 1.1% to 34.1 ± 0.8%, P &lt; 0.001) and age-adjusted prevalence (29.2 ± 1.0% to 34.2 ± 0.7%, P &lt; 0.001) increased from NHANES III to NHANES 1999-2006, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although MetSyn prevalence was highest in Mexican Americans, significant increases in prevalence occurred among non-Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic blacks, especially among younger women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The persistent increase of MetSyn among U.S. adults is a serious public health concern because it raises the likelihood of increased prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
