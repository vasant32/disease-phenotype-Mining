<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because a pivotal role for ABCA1 in pancreatic beta-cell function was recently observed in the mouse model, we assessed the association of this variant with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The initial group included 446 unrelated Mexican individuals: 244 with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> aged 20-69 years (121 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> &lt;/=45 years), and 202 nondiabetic control subjects aged &gt;50 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An independent study group included 242 type 2 diabetic case subjects and 225 control subjects with similar characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: R230C/C230C genotypes were significantly more frequent in type 2 diabetic individuals (24.6%) than in control subjects (11.4%) in the initial study group (OR 2.501; P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After stratifying by age at diagnosis, the association was significant only in the early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> group (age at diagnosis &lt;/=45 years) (OR 3.776, P = 3.3 x 10(-6)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both associations remained significant after adjusting for admixture (P = 0.0008 and P = 8.1 x 10(-6), respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similar trends were observed in the independent study group, and the combined analysis of both populations showed a highly significant association of the R230C variant with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, particularly with that of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (P = 7.6 x 10(-6) and 9.4 x 10(-8), respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The R230C ABCA1 variant is associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, particularly of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, in the Mexican-Mestizo population </plain></SENT>
