<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>African-American patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have more than a fourfold increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of hyperfiltration on renal function in African-American patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Renal function of 194 African-American patients with diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from 1 month to 36 years was assessed by studies of isotopic glomerular filtration rate (GFR), serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance, and 24-h urinary albumin excretion rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four patients with a duration of diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from 1 month to 10 years were found to have hyperfiltration (GFR &gt; or = 140 ml.min-1.1.73 m-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifteen of these patients received longitudinal follow-up of renal function for as long as 15 years after the initial study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Hyperfiltration is present in 15 (36%) of 42 patients whose duration of diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is &lt; 1 year, and it persists for up to 10 years in 14-20% of patients with diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with hyperfiltration are younger than their counterparts without hyperfiltration when matched for duration of diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When followed over time, those patients with hyperfiltration were not more likely to develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>impaired renal function</z:hpo> as measured by GFR or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Hyperfiltration does not identify patients at risk for deterioration in renal function </plain></SENT>
