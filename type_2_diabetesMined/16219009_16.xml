<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The usefulness of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> as an oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> agent is widely accepted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, several other classes of oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> agents have been recently introduced, raising the need to evaluate the role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> as initial therapy and in combination with these newer drugs for treatment of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Synthesis of information was preceded by a comprehensive review of the English language literature using Medline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also reviewed bibliographies of relevant articles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The studies most pertinent to the mechanism of action, efficacy, toxicity and administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> were selected for citation in this review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> acts by increasing tissue sensitivity to insulin, principally in the liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Beneficial properties of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> include weight reduction, favourable effects on the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile and the fibrinolytic pathway, and improvement of ovarian function in some insulin-resistant women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It does not cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020459" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperinsulinaemia</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> is effective as monotherapy and, in combination with both insulin secretagogues and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> (TZDs), may obviate the need for insulin treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Several fixed-dose combination pills containing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and other agents are available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A protocol for the initiation of therapy with contemporary oral agents for type 2 DM is presented, with emphasis on the continuing central role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> remains a safe and effective agent for the therapy of patients with type 2 DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is useful as monotherapy or in combination regimens with the newer insulin secretagogues, TZDs or insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It is still in most circumstances the agent of choice for initial therapy of the typical <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patient with type 2 DM and mild to moderate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
