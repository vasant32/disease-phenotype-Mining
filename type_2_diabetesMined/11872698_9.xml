<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Associations between type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (and/or parameters contributing to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis) and genetic variation in the genes encoding insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 and -2 have been reported in several populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, it has been reported that the Gly(972)Arg variant in IRS-1 was associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0003059'>reduced insulin secretion</z:mp> during hyperglycemic clamps in German subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have examined <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion in relation to gene variants in the IRS-1 (Gly(972)Arg) and IRS-2 (Gly(1057)Asp) genes in two Dutch cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (n = 64) or impaired (n = 94) <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance underwent 3-h hyperglycemic clamps at 10 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects were genotyped for the IRS-1 and IRS-2 variants by PCR-RFLP--based methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We did not observe any significant difference in both first- and second-phase insulin secretion between carriers and noncarriers of both gene variants, nor was there evidence for an association with other <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the common gene variants in IRS-1 and IRS-2 are not associated with altered <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion in two populations from the Netherlands </plain></SENT>
