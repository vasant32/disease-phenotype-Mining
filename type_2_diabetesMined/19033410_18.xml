<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors for achieving A1C &lt;7% in 11,799 patients (1,898 type 1 diabetic and 9,901 type 2 diabetic) recruited by 937 physicians from 17 countries in Eastern Europe (n = 3,519), Asia (n = 5,888), Latin America (n = 2,116), and Africa (n = 276) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-two percent of type 1 diabetic and 36% of type 2 diabetic patients never had A1C measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In those with values for A1C, blood pressure, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, 7.5% of type 1 diabetic (n = 696) and 3.6% of type 2 diabetic (n = 3,896) patients attained <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three recommended targets (blood pressure &lt;130/80 mmHg, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> &lt;100 mg/dl, and A1C &lt;7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Self-monitoring of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was the only predictor for achieving the A1C goal in type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (odds ratios: Asia 2.24, Latin America 3.55, and Eastern Europe 2.42) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, short disease duration (Asia 0.97, Latin America 0.97, and Eastern Europe 0.82) and treatment with few oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering drugs (Asia 0.64, Latin America 0.76, and Eastern Europe 0.62) were predictors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other region-specific factors included lack of microvascular complications and old age in Latin America and Asia; health insurance coverage and specialist care in Latin America; lack of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and self-adjustment of insulin dosages in Asia; and training by a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> educator, self-monitoring of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in patients who self-adjusted insulin, and lack of macrovascular complications in Eastern Europe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In developing countries, factors pertinent to patients, doctors, and health care systems <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> impact on glycemic control </plain></SENT>
