<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of the considerable homology between <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> and cerebral microcirculation, we examined whether <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vascular calibre, as a proxy of cerebral microvascular disease, was associated with cognitive function in older people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis of 954 people aged 60-75 years with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from the population-based Edinburgh Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Participants underwent standard seven-field binocular digital <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> photography and a battery of seven cognitive function tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Mill Hill Vocabulary Scale was used to estimate pre-morbid cognitive ability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">Retinal</z:chebi> vascular calibre was measured from an image field with the optic disc in the centre using a validated computer-based program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After age and sex adjustment, larger <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> arteriolar and venular calibres were significantly associated with lower scores for the Wechsler Logical Memory test, with standardised regression coefficients -0.119 and -0.084, respectively (p &lt; 0.01), but not with other cognitive tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a significant interaction between sex and <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vascular calibre for logical memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In male participants, the association of increased <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> arteriolar calibre with logical memory persisted (p &lt; 0.05) when further adjusted for vocabulary, venular calibre, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> and macrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In female participants, this association was weaker and not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">Retinal</z:chebi> arteriolar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> was associated with poorer memory, independent of estimated prior cognitive ability in older men with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The sex interaction with stronger findings in men requires confirmation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, these data suggest that impaired cerebral arteriolar autoregulation in smooth muscle cells, leading to arteriolar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath>, may be a possible pathogenic mechanism in verbal declarative memory decrements in people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
