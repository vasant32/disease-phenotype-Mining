<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Caspases are the major molecules involved in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>; however, in vivo roles of specific caspases in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to examine the role of Caspase (Casp)8 in beta-cells in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using the Cre-loxP system, mice lacking Casp8 in beta-cells (RIPcre(+)Casp8(fl/fl) mice) were generated to address the role of Casp8 in beta-cells in physiological and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We show that islets isolated from RIPcre(+)Casp8(fl/fl) mice were protected from Fas ligand (FasL)-and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi>-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, RIPcre(+)Casp8(fl/fl) mice were protected from in vivo models of type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition to being the central mediator of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> models, we show that Casp8 is critical for maintenance of beta-cell mass under physiological conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With aging, RIPcre(+)Casp8(fl/fl) mice gradually develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> and a concomitant decline in beta-cell mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Their islets display decreased expression of molecules involved in insulin/IGF-I signaling and show decreased pancreatic duodenal homeobox-1 and cAMP response element binding protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At the level of individual islets, we observed increased insulin secretory capacity associated with increased expression of exocytotic proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results show distinct context-specific roles of Casp8 in physiological and <z:mp ids='MP_0002054'>disease states</z:mp>; Casp8 is essential for beta-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> models and in regulating beta-cell mass and insulin secretion under physiological conditions </plain></SENT>
