<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Postpartum women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> (n = 28) completed a mail survey assessing their self-reported exercise beliefs (advantages, barriers, and important social influences) and behaviors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that 1) the strongest perceived advantage of exercise during pregnancy was controlling blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and postpartum it was controlling weight, 2) the most common barrier to exercise during pregnancy was <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> and postpartum it was a lack of time, 3) women's husband/partner most strongly influenced their exercise during pregnancy and postpartum, 4) women exercised more during the postpartum period than before or during pregnancy, and 5) the number of exercise advantages was positively associated with women's pregnancy and postpartum exercise behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: To increase exercise behavior and reduce the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e>, researchers and health care professionals are encouraged to use women's exercise beliefs, that is, advantages, social influences, and perceived barriers to exercise, as a framework for designing effective <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treatment and prevention programs </plain></SENT>
