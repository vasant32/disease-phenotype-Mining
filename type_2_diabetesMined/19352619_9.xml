<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in human type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, levels of human IAPP are equivalent or decreased relative to matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, we sought to investigate whether ER stress is induced during amyloidogenesis at physiological levels of human IAPP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Islets from human IAPP transgenic mice that develop amyloid, and non-transgenic mice that do not, were cultured for up to 7 days in 11.1, 16.7 and 33.3 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pancreases from human IAPP transgenic and non-transgenic mice and humans with or without type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Amyloid formation was determined histologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ER stress was determined in islets by quantifying <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of Bip, Atf4 and Chop (also known as Ddit3) and alternate splicing of Xbp1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, or in pancreases by immunostaining for immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein (BIP), C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) and X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Amyloid formation in human IAPP transgenic islets was associated with reduced beta cell area in a <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>- and time-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, amyloid formation was not associated with significant increases in expression of ER stress markers under any culture condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thapsigargin treatment, a positive control, did result in significant ER stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Amyloid formation in vivo in pancreas samples from human IAPP transgenic mice or humans was not associated with upregulation of ER stress markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our data suggest that ER stress is not an obligatory pathway mediating the toxic effects of amyloid formation at physiological levels of human IAPP </plain></SENT>
