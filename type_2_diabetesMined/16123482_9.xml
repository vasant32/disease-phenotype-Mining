<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Comorbid <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>psychiatric disorders</z:hpo> have been associated with poorer disease outcomes in diabetic youth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Less is known, however, about the relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>psychiatric disorders</z:hpo> and repeat hospitalizations for youth with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study using data from the Pediatric Health Information System, which included detailed discharge data from 37 non-competing children's hospitals in the U.S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using logistic regression, we examined whether the presence of coded diagnoses for internalizing or externalizing disorders at an index hospitalization for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was associated with increased risk for rehospitalization during follow-up (duration of follow-up ranged from 3 to 24 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The analysis was stratified by age-groups, and we controlled for potential confounders including sex, age, race/ethnicity, type 1 versus type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, Medicaid status, intensive care unit utilization, length of stay during index admission, and duration of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among adolescents aged 13-18, internalizing disorders were associated with significantly increased odds of rehospitalization (odds ratio 1.79 [95% CI 1.27-2.52]); the point estimate for externalizing disorders was similar, but the finding was not statistically significant at the alpha = 0.05 level (1.74 [0.96-3.15]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant association between psychiatric diagnoses and odds of repeat hospitalization was observed in diabetic children aged 5-12 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Internalizing disorders are associated with increases in repeat hospitalizations for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among adolescents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Future research is needed to explore the reasons for this finding, such as degree to which treatment nonadherence mediates this relationship and whether appropriate treatment of internalizing disorders results in improved <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> outcomes and decreased readmissions </plain></SENT>
