<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the effect of two <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> nutrients, R-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30314">alpha-lipoic acid</z:chebi> (LA) and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-L-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi> (ALC), as well as their combined effect, on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> biogenesis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>Mitochondrial</z:hpo> mass and oxygen consumption were determined in 3T3-L1 adipocytes cultured in the presence of LA and/or ALC for 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>Mitochondrial</z:hpo> DNA and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> from peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma and alpha (Pparg and Ppara) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi> palmitoyl transferase 1a (Cpt1a), as well as several transcription factors involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> biogenesis, were evaluated by real-time PCR or electrophoretic mobility shift (EMSA) assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>Mitochondrial</z:hpo> complexes proteins were measured by western blot and fatty acid oxidation was measured by quantifying <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> production from [1-14C]<z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treatments with the combination of LA and ALC at concentrations of 0.1, 1 and 10 micromol/l for 24 h significantly increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> mass, expression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> DNA, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> complexes, oxygen consumption and fatty acid oxidation in 3T3L1 adipocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These changes were accompanied by an increase in expression of Pparg, Ppara and Cpt1a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, as well as increased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma coactivator 1 alpha (Ppargc1a), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> transcription factor A (Tfam) and nuclear respiratory factors 1 and 2 (Nrf1 and Nrf2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the treatments with LA or ALC alone at the same concentrations showed little effect on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> function and biogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We conclude that the combination of LA and ALC may act as PPARG/A dual ligands to complementarily promote <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> synthesis and adipocyte metabolism </plain></SENT>
