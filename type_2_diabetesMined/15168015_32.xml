<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We carried out two series of euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the first (CLAMP1), skeletal muscle <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression and plasma concentrations of IL-6 and TNFalpha were examined in patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> ( n=6), subjects matched for age (n=6), and young healthy (n=11) control subjects during a 120-min supra-physiological hyperinsulinaemic (40 mU.m(-2).min(-1)) euglycaemic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the second series of experiments (CLAMP2), patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n=6) and subjects matched for age (n=7) were studied during a 240-min high-physiological hyperinsulinaemic (7 mU.m(-2).min(-1)) euglycaemic clamp, during which arterial and venous (femoral and subclavian) blood samples were measured for IL-6 and TNFalpha flux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In both experiments the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion rate in the patients was markedly lower than that in the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In CLAMP1, basal skeletal muscle IL-6 and TNFalpha <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were the same in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They were not affected by insulin and they were not related to the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In CLAMP2, neither cytokine was released from the arm or leg during insulin stimulation in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In both experiments plasma concentrations of these cytokines were similar in the patients and in the control subjects, although in CLAMP1 the young healthy control group had lower (p&lt;0.05) plasma IL-6 concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Using data from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects, a strong positive correlation (r=0.85; p&lt;0.00001) was observed between basal plasma IL-6 and BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conversely, a negative relationship (r=-0.345; p&lt;0.05) was found between basal plasma TNFalpha and BMI, although this was not significant when corrected for BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>When corrected for BMI, no relationship was observed between either basal plasma IL-6 or TNFalpha and GIR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These data show that the increased circulating IL-6 concentrations seen in patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are strongly related to fat mass and not insulin responsiveness, and suggest that neither IL-6 nor TNFalpha are indicative of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
