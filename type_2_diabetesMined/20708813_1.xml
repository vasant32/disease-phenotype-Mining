<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of using AST-120 to treat patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and advanced-stage CKD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used Markov model simulating the progression of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data were obtained from randomized trials estimating the progression of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> with and without AST-120, and published literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The base population was patients 60 years of age with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and Stages 3 and 4 CKD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treating patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and advanced-stage CKD was found to be a dominant strategy, and quality of life improved further and more money was saved (0.22 quality-adjusted life years [QALYs] and $15,019 per patient) using AST-120 than the control strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity analysis results were robust with regard to cost, adherence, and quality of life associated with AST-120 therapy, as well as age at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The model was relatively sensitive to the effectiveness of AST-120 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Treating patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and advanced-stage CKD with AST-120 appears to extend life and reduce costs </plain></SENT>
