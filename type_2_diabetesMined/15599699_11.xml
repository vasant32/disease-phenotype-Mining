<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We screened 24 individuals for SNPs in AHSG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six haplotype-tagging SNPs were genotyped in 188 lean and 176 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> otherwise healthy women for whom common blood chemistry phenotypes were also available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adipocyte lipolysis and lipogenesis phenotypes were quantified in a subset of 117 lean and 174 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The -469T&gt;G SNP, which is located in the 5' region of AHSG, was associated with insulin-mediated inhibition of lipolysis and stimulation of lipogenesis, as well as basal and 8-bromocyclic <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>-stimulated lipolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three AHSG SNPs were associated with circulating levels of cholesterol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of the six genotyped SNPs or inferred haplotypes were associated with BMI, calculated percent body fat, waist circumference, circulating levels of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> or insulin, or homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, which was used as an estimate of in vivo insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our results are in agreement with a threshold model of susceptibility for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, in which specific genetic loci regulate intermediate molecular phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When an individual's set of susceptibility alleles at such loci exceeds a threshold, clinical disease occurs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Lipolysis in adipocytes appears to be a phenotype that is particularly sensitive to variation in AHSG </plain></SENT>
