<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> (SU) treatment on serum proinsulin levels and proinsulin/insulin ratio (PI/I) during oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test in patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirteen diabetic patients (age 56 +/- 9 years, body mass index 22.4 +/- 1.9 kg/m2, mean +/- SD) were examined by 75 g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) before and after glycemic control by SU therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean interval of two OGTTs was 126 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum proinsulin was measured by the radioimmunoassay using a human proinsulin-specific antiserum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When glycemic control improved after SU therapy (mean fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> 11.5 and 6.0 mmol/l, before and after SU treatment), fasting insulin, proinsulin and PI/I ratio did not change significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Insulin response during OGTT markedly increased after SU therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Summed value of insulin (sigma I) increased from 634 to 1064 pmol/l after SU (P &lt; 0.01), whereas summed proinsulin (sigma PI) did not change significantly (146 and 159 pmol/l), resulting in a significant decrease in sigma PI/sigma I (23.6-15.1%, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the disproportionate elevation of proinsulin during OGTT in patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> can be reduced after glycemic control by SU treatment, chiefly by a selective increase in insulin response </plain></SENT>
