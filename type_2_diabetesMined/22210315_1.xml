<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has recently been suggested that the low-frequency c.136-14_136-13insC variant in high-mobility group A1 (HMGA1) may strongly contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In our study, we attempted to confirm that HMGA1 is a novel type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> locus in French Caucasians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The gene was sequenced in 368 type 2 diabetic case subjects with a family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 372 normoglycemic control subjects without a family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>None of the 41 genetic variations identified were associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The lack of association between the c.136-14_136-13insC variant and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was confirmed in an independent French group of 4,538 case subjects and 4,015 control subjects and in a large meta-analysis of 16,605 case subjects and 46,179 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, this variant had no effects on metabolic traits and was not involved in variations of HMGA1 and insulin receptor (INSR) expressions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The c.136-14_136-13insC variant was not associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in individuals of European descent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our study emphasizes the need to analyze a large number of subjects to reliably assess the association of low-frequency variants with the disease </plain></SENT>
