<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A series of nested studies within a prospective cohort of 151,347 working-aged men and women including 9,197 participants with continuing antidepressant medication, 224 with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and 851 with incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during a mean follow-up of 4.8 years, as indicated by national health and prescription registers (the Public Sector study, Finland 1995-2005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the first analysis, the case subjects were individuals with incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with matched <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-free control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Antidepressant use of ≥ 200 defined daily doses was associated with a doubling of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk in both participants with no indication of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (odds ratio 1.93 [95% CI 1.48-2.51]) and participants with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (2.65 [1.31-5.39]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In further analyses, the exposed group was antidepressant users and the reference group was nonusers matched for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>-related characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 5-year absolute risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 1.1% for nonusers, 1.7% for individuals treated with 200-399 defined daily doses a year, and 2.3% for those with ≥ 400 defined daily doses (P(trend) &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An average self-reported <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>, based on repeated surveys, was 1.4 kg (2.5%) among nonusers and 2.5 kg (4.3%) among users of ≥ 200 defined daily doses (P(trend) &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Separate analyses for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="36809">tricyclic antidepressants</z:chebi> and selective <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> reuptake inhibitors replicated these findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In these data, continuing use of antidepressant medication was associated with an increased relative risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, although the elevation in absolute risk was modest </plain></SENT>
