<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a hyperinsulinaemic state such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> or Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, this phosphorylation could be modified and exacerbate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed at identifying serine residues in IRS-1 phosphorylated in response to insulin stimulation and at determining the involved kinases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 3T3-L1 adipocytes, muscle and adipose tissue of mice were subjected to Western Blot analysis with phosphospecific antibodies to identify phosphorylation sites in IRS-1 following insulin treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pharmacological inhibitors were used to determine the serine kinases involved in this phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, insulin promoted the phosphorylation of serine 307, 612 and 632 with Serine(612/632) more rapidly phosphorylated than Serine(307) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Insulin-induced phosphorylation of Serine(307) was dependent on the activation of a PI 3-kinase/mTOR pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The phosphorylation of Serine(612/632) required the activation of the MAP kinase pathway following short-term insulin stimulation and activation of the PI 3-kinase/mTOR pathway following prolonged insulin stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylation of Serine(307) and Serine(632) occurred in vivo in skeletal muscle and white adipose tissue of mice injected with insulin and was dependent on the activation of mTOR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, inhibition of mTOR led to a persistent PI 3-kinase activation by insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: Insulin-induced IRS-1 serine phosphorylation is a complex process involving different sites and kinases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This complexity could be physiologically important to accurately regulate insulin signalling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Abnormal phosphorylation of these serine residues in hyperinsulinaemic state could participate in the down-regulation of insulin signalling </plain></SENT>
