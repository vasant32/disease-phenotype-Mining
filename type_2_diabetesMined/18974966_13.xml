<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether the peripheral circadian clock is impaired in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Peripheral leucocytes were obtained from eight patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and six comparatively young non-diabetic volunteers at 09:00, 15:00, 21:00 and 03:00 hours (study 1) and from 12 male patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 14 age-matched men at 09:00 hours (study 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transcript levels of clock genes (CLOCK, BMAL1 [also known as ARNTL], PER1, PER2, PER3 and CRY1) were determined by real-time quantitative PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In study 1, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression patterns of BMAL1, PER1, PER2 and PER3 exhibited 24 h rhythmicity in the leucocytes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 14 individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression levels of these <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> were significantly (p &lt; 0.05) lower in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than in non-diabetic individuals at one or more time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the amplitudes of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression rhythms of PER1 and PER3 genes tended to diminish in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In study 2, leucocytes obtained from patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> expressed significantly (p &lt; 0.05) lower transcript levels of BMAL1, PER1 and PER3 compared with leucocytes from control individuals, and transcript expression was inversely correlated with HbA(1c) levels (rho = -0.47 to -0.55, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These results suggest that rhythmic <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of clock genes is dampened in peripheral leucocytes of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The impairment of the circadian clock appears to be closely associated with the pathophysiology of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in humans </plain></SENT>
