<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we aimed to investigate the capabilities of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>-proANP in predicting mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also investigated whether <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>-proANP influences the relationship between blood pressure and mortality in old age.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSIn 1998, 1,143 primary care patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> participated in the ZODIAC study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because blood was drawn for 867 patients (76%) and confounders were missing for 19 patients, the final study sample comprised 848 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After a follow-up time of 10 years, we used Cox proportional hazard models to evaluate the relationship between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>-proANP and (cardiovascular) mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Harrell C statistic was used to compare models with and without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>-proANP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The regression analyses were repeated without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>-proANP for patients aged older than 75 years.RESULTSMedian <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>-proANP in the total study sample was 75 pmol/L (interquartile range, 48-124 pmol/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, 354 (42%) out of 848 patients had died, of whom 152 (43%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were attributable to cardiovascular factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>-proANP was independently associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause and cardiovascular mortality, irrespective of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During old age, there was a significant inverse relationship between blood pressure and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This relationship did not change after adjustment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>-proANP.CONCLUSIONSMR-proANP is independently associated with mortality in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>-proANP did not influence the inverse relationship between blood pressure and mortality in elderly patients </plain></SENT>
