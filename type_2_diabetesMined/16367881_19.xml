<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this multinational, open-labelled, parallel group, 16-week trial, 341 patients (patients not adequately controlled with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> for at least 1 month) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomized to receive BIAsp 30, twice daily (n = 107 exposed to treatment), or BIAsp 30, twice daily, plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (n = 108) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (n = 114) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was HbA(1c) at end of trial; adverse events, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> episodes, blood <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and weight were also monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the total population (HbA(1c) 7.5-13.0% at screening), end-of-trial HbA(1c) levels were lower in patients receiving BIAsp 30 plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> compared with those receiving BIAsp 30 only [mean treatment difference (+/-s.e.m), 0.39 +/- 0.15%, p = 0.007] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a subpopulation (HbA(1c) &gt; or = 9.0% at baseline, n = 193), patients receiving BIAsp 30 plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> had significantly lower HbA(1c) levels at the end of the trial compared with those receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (treatment difference, 0.46 +/- 0.21%, p = 0.027) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean body weight (+/-s.d) at the end of the trial was significantly lower in patients receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> compared with those receiving BIAsp 30 only (84.3 +/- 13.3 kg vs. 88.9 +/- 16.9 kg, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0745153" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemic episodes</z:e> were recorded during the trial, and incidence rates for minor and symptoms-only <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> were low and similar between treatment groups (0.03-0.04 events/patient/week) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: BIAsp 30 added to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> could be an appropriate therapeutic option for achieving good glycaemic control, compared with the addition of a second oral agent, particularly where HbA(1c) &gt; or = 9% </plain></SENT>
