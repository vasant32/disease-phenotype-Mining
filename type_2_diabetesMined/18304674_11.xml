<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This pilot study tested the effects of a counseling intervention using continuous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring system (CGMS) feedback on PA self-efficacy, PA levels, and physiological variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adults (N=52) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (non-insulin requiring, inactive) were randomized to intervention (n=27) or control (n=25) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both groups received 90min of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> education with a follow-up phone call 4 weeks later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The intervention group also received counseling derived from self-efficacy theory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This intervention included feedback on each participant's CGMS graph and used role model CGMS graphs to clearly depict <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> reductions in response to PA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Outcomes were assessed at baseline and 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Participants receiving the intervention had higher self-efficacy scores than the control group for sticking to activity/resisting relapse at 8 weeks (p&lt;0.05), indicating more confidence in maintaining a PA program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intervention group participants light/sedentary activity minutes decreased significantly (p&lt;0.05), moderate activity minutes increased significantly (p&lt;0.05), and, HbA1c and BMI decreased significantly (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that PA counseling interventions using CGMS feedback for individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may improve PA levels and reduce risk factors for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related complications </plain></SENT>
