<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective was to compare <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> 24 h profiles in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> after dosing with nateglinide (given preprandially before three test meals), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> (administered once before breakfast) or placebo (given before three test meals) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fourteen patients underwent screening followed within 3 weeks by three treatment periods of 1 day, each separated by 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dosing followed a six-sequence balanced, two 3 x 3-replicated Latin square </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean peak serum insulin levels were lower after nateglinide (115 mU/l) than after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> (145 mU/l.h; p = 0.017) but higher than after placebo (79 mU/l; p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, peak insulin levels were reached earlier after nateglinide [mean time to peak (tmax) 1.7 h] compared to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> (mean tmax 2.1 h, p = 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Total insulin exposure over the day was higher after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> compared with that following nateglinide (1216 vs. 1067 mU/l.h; p = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similar findings were seen with serum C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Despite this, mean peak plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations were lower following nateglinide (11.4 mmol/l from a baseline of 8.3 mmol/l) compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> (13.2 mmol/l from a baseline of 8.5 mmol/l; p = 0.001) and placebo (14.0 mmol/l from a baseline of 8.0 mmol/L; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Nateglinide improves early prandial measures of insulin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> response to a standard meal, more so than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi>, in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
