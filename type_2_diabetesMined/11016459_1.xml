<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we investigated the catalytic subunit p110beta, of human PI 3-kinase as a candidate gene for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Human p110beta gene was cloned from the placental genomic library </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 22 exons, intronic regions flanking the exons and 1.5 kb of the proximal/5' region of the p110beta gene, were screened for variants by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis in 79 Finnish patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Allele frequencies of the variants were also determined in 77 nondiabetic control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No variants were found in exons in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, we identified two nucleotide polymorphisms in the proximal/5' region of the p110beta gene and a variation in the number of 2-bp repeat sequence (TA)n in intron 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The allele frequencies did not differ between diabetic and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results may indicate that the catalytic subunit p110beta of PI 3-kinase plays such a fundamental role in the insulin-signaling pathway that structural variants are not likely to exist in that gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The importance of the polymorphisms in the proximal/5' region of the p110beta gene for insulin signaling remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
