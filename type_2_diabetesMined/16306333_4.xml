<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Extended human pedigrees often show <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> of both <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A common pathophysiological denominator in both disease forms is pancreatic beta-cell exposure to proinflammatory cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hence, it is intuitive that systemically expressed genes regulating beta-cell ability to withstand <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> diabetogenic stress may represent a component of shared susceptibility to both major disease forms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this review, the authors assemble evidence from genetic experiments using animal models developing clearly distinct <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> syndromes to inquire whether some degree of overlap in genes contributing susceptibility can be demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The conclusion is that although overlap exists in the pathophysiological insults leading to beta-cell destruction in the currently studied <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519106" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">rodent models</z:e>, the genetic bases seem quite distinct </plain></SENT>
