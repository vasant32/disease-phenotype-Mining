<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to assess the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and to identify their associated factors including metabolic components among people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional, multi-center study in four out-patient clinics in Karachi, Pakistan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 889 adults with type-2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> were measured by using the Hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Scale (HADS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariable analysis using multiple logistic regression was carried out to evaluate the combined effect of various factors associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, while adjusting for confounding variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 57.9% (95% CI = 54.7%, 61.2%) and 43.5% (95% CI = 40.3%, 46.8%) study participants had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Factors found to be independently associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> were physical inactivity, having <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, being female, of older age, having <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> were significantly associated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Metabolic components found to be independently associated with both <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> were systolic blood pressure, fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and fasting blood <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Body mass index was independently associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> but not with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study identified that a large proportion of adults with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and identified factors associated with these entities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results alert clinicians to identify and treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> as common components of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Additional studies are needed to establish the directional nature of this relationship and to test interventions </plain></SENT>
