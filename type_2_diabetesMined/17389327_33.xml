<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, their associations with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> remain inconclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a prospective nested case-control study to examine the associations between plasma levels of E-selectin, intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and vascular cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk among 82,069 initially healthy women aged 50-79 years from the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During a median follow-up of 5.9 years, 1,584 incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> case subjects were matched with 2,198 control subjects by age, ethnicity, clinical center, time of blood draw, and follow-up time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Baseline median levels of the biomarkers were each significantly higher among case subjects than among control subjects (E-selectin, 49 vs. 37 ng/ml; ICAM-1, 324 vs. 280 ng/ml; and VCAM-1, 765 vs. 696 ng/ml [<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P values &lt;0.001]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for risk factors, the relative risks of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among women in the highest quartile versus those in the lowest quartile were 3.46 for E-selectin (95% CI 2.56-4.68; P for trend &lt;0.0001), 2.34 for ICAM-1 (1.75-3.13; P for trend &lt;0.0001), and 1.48 for VCAM-1 (1.07-2.04; P for trend = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>E-selectin and ICAM-1 remain significant in each ethnic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, higher levels of E-selectin and ICAM-1 were consistently associated with increased <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk in a multiethnic cohort of U.S. postmenopausal women, implicating an etiological role of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> in the pathogenesis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
