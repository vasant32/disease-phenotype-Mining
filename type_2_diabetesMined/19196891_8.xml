<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Anthropometry was measured at baseline for 1,073 non-Hispanic white (nHW), African American (AA), and Hispanic (HA) subjects, of whom 146 developed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after 5.2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression models were used with areas under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AROCs) comparing the prediction of models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Waist-to-height ratio (AROC 0.678) was the most predictive measure, followed by BMI (AROC 0.674) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results were similar in nHW and HA subjects, although in AA subjects, central <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> measures appeared to best predict type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Measures of central and overall <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> predicted type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> to a similar degree, except in AA subjects, for whom results suggested that central measures were more predictive </plain></SENT>
