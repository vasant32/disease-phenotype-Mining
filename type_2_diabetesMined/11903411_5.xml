<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on regular Gb therapy (1.75-14.0 mg daily) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were taken immediately before and 90 min after regular Gb intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A standardized breakfast was served 30 min after drug intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum insulin and proinsulin levels were determined by ELISA methods without cross-reactivities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum drug levels were determined by HPLC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fischer's R to Z-test (correlation coefficients) and paired Student t-tests were used when comparing values within the entire group and unpaired non-parametric Mann-Whitney tests were used when comparing high and low dose levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A p-value &lt; 0.05 was considered significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were significant correlations between daily Gb dose, on the one hand, and, on the other, HbAlc (r = 0.55), Delta-insulin (r = - 0.59) and Delta-proinsulin (r = - 0.52) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significant correlations between Gb therapy duration and insulin (r = - 0.40) and proinsulin (r = - 0.34) secretion and between Gb dose and ratio proinsulin/insulin (RPI) at both time points (r = 0.32 and 0.30) were also found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The RPI was lower after Gb intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In patients on &gt; or = 10.5 mg steady state serum metabolite levels (Ml and Ml + M2) were higher (29(0-120) and 33 (0-120) ng/ml) than those of Gb itself (18(0-64) ng/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A great inter-subject variability in Gb levels at both time points was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that, in patients on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> medication, Gb is capable of stimulating both insulin and proinsulin secretion; the effect on insulin release is relatively greater </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The effect was more pronounced in patients on a low Gb dose, either because of less impaired beta-cells in those receiving low doses, or due to reduced sulphonylurea sensitivity in those on high dosage (down-regulation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In patients on a daily dose of 10.5 mg or more, serum metabolite levels of clinical relevance were demonstrated; the metabolites may contribute to hypoglycaemic events </plain></SENT>
