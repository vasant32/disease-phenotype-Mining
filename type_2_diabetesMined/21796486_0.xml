<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The intracellular metabolic consequences of a chronically high availability of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in beta cells are, as yet, poorly understood in its full complexity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An unbiased metabolite profiling analysis (GC-time-of-flight-MS) was used to identify the time course of core metabolite patterns in rat beta cell line INS-1E during exposure to high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations and its relation to insulin expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We report here that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25901">pentose</z:chebi> phosphate pathway (PPP) metabolites accumulate remarkably during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> treatment, indicating altered processing of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> through the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25901">pentose</z:chebi> phosphate pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequent functional studies in INS-1E cells and human islets revealed that a disturbance in this pathway contributes to decreases in insulin gene expression and a lack of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These effects were found to depend on the activation of extracellular-regulated-kinase (ERK1/2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Long-term inhibition of 6-phosphogluconic acid dehydrogenase resulted in accumulation of PPP metabolites, induced ERK1/2 activation independently of high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and impaired beta cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In turn, inhibition of ERK1/2 overstimulation during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> exposure partly inhibited metabolite accumulation and restored beta cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Based on unbiased metabolite analyses, the data presented here provide novel targets, namely the inhibition of PPP metabolite accumulation towards the therapeutic goal to preserve and potentially improve beta cell function in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
