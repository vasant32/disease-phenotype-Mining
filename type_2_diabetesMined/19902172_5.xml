<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate two quantitative, directly assessed measures of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, namely insulin sensitivity index (S(I)) and insulin disposition index (DI), in Hispanic-American participants using an agnostic, high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) scan, and to validate these findings in additional samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A two-stage GWAS was performed in Hispanic-American samples from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin Resistance</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Family Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In Stage 1, 317,000 SNPs were assessed using 229 DNA samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SNPs with evidence of association with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> traits were then genotyped on the entire set of Hispanic-American samples (n = 1,190) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This report focuses on the <z:mp ids='MP_0002611'>glucose homeostasis traits</z:mp>: S(I) and DI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although evidence of association did not reach genome-wide significance (p = 5 x 10(-7)), in the combined analysis SNPs had admixture-adjusted p values of p (ADD) = 0.00010-0.0020 with 8 to 41% differences in genotypic means for S(I) and DI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Several candidate loci were identified that are nominally associated with S(I) and/or DI in Hispanic-American participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Replication of these findings in independent cohorts and additional focused analysis of these loci is warranted </plain></SENT>
