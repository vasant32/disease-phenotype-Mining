<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To clarify the contribution of the Pro12Ala polymorphism of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) gene to susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and related diseases, 505 unrelated Japanese subjects were investigated, including 175 normotensive non-diabetic (NN) subjects, 125 normotensive diabetic (ND) subjects, 102 hypertensive non-diabetic (HN) subjects, and 103 hypertensive diabetic (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>) subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ala phenotype frequency was lowest in patients with both type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (3.9% in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> group), followed by patients with either one of these conditions (5.6% in ND group, 7.8% in HN group), and highest in subjects without these conditions (9.7% in NN group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When stratified by hypertensive status, the Ala phenotype was negatively associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, giving an odds ratio of 0.53 (95% confidence interval: 0.25-1.09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, when stratified by diabetic status, the odds ratio of the Ala phenotype for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was 0.75 (95% confidence interval: 0.37-1.54) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In non-diabetic hypertensive subjects, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin levels during oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test as well as M-value estimated by <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-clamp test were not significantly different according to the genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The data suggest a contribution of the Pro12Ala polymorphism of PPARgamma to genetic susceptibility to type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, but not to insulin sensitivity in hypertensive subjects </plain></SENT>
