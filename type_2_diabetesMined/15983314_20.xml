<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is associated with reduced exercise capacity, but the cause of this association is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought the associations of impaired exercise capacity in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Subclinical left ventricular (LV) dysfunction was sought from myocardial strain rate and the basal segmental diastolic velocity (Em) of each wall in 170 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (aged 56 +/- 10 years, 91 men), good quality echocardiographic images, and negative exercise echocardiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The same measurements were made in 56 control subjects (aged 53 +/- 10 years, 29 men) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Exercise capacity was calculated in metabolic equivalents, and heart rate recovery (HRR) was measured as the heart rate difference between peak and 1 min after exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, exercise capacity was correlated with clinical, therapeutic, biochemical, and echocardiographic variables, and significant independent associations were sought using a multiple linear regression model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Exercise capacity, strain rate, Em, and HRR were significantly reduced in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Exercise capacity was associated with age (r = -0.37, P &lt; 0.001), male sex (r = 0.26, P = 0.001), BMI (r = -0.19, P = 0.012), HbA(1c) (A1C; r = -0.22, P = 0.009), Em (r = 0.43, P &lt; 0.001), HRR (r = 0.42, P &lt; 0.001), <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration (r = -0.18, P = 0.021), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> history (r = -0.28, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Age (P &lt; 0.001), male sex (P = 0.007), BMI (P = 0.001), Em (P = 0.032), HRR (P = 0.013), and A1C (P = 0.0007) were independent predictors of exercise capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Reduced exercise capacity in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> control, subclinical LV dysfunction, and impaired HRR </plain></SENT>
