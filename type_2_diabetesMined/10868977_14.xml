<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a genome-wide scan to detect genes influencing variation in fasting serum insulin concentrations in 391 nondiabetic individuals from 10 large multigenerational families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Approximately 380 microsatellite markers with an average spacing of 10 cM were genotyped in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> study subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Insulin concentrations measured by radioimmunoassay were transformed by their natural logarithms before analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In multipoint analysis, peak evidence for linkage occurred on chromosome 3p approximately 109 cM from pter in the region of 3p14.2-p14.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The multipoint logarithm of odds (LOD) score was 3.07, occurring in the region flanked by markers D3S1600 and D3S1285 (P value by simulation &lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a two-point analysis, LOD scores ranged from 0.75 to 2.52 for the nine markers typed in the region spanning 88-143 cM from pter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The fasting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> index was highly correlated with fasting insulin concentrations in this sample and also provided strong evidence for linkage to this region (LOD = 2.99) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence in our genome-wide scan for linkage of insulin levels to any other chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results provide evidence that a gene-influencing variation in insulin concentrations exists on chromosome 3p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Possible candidate genes in this region include GBE1 and ACOX2, which encode enzymes involved in <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> and fatty acid metabolism, respectively </plain></SENT>
