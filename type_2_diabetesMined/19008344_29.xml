<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: In recent genome-wide association studies, variants in CDKAL1, SLC30A8, HHEX, EXT2, IGF2BP2, CDKN2B, LOC387761, and FTO were associated with risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Caucasians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the association of these single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and some additional tag SNPs with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and related quantitative traits in Pima Indians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Forty-seven SNPs were genotyped in 3,501 Pima Indians informative for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and BMI, among whom 370 had measures of quantitative traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: FTO provided the strongest evidence for replication, where SNPs were associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (odds ratio = 1.20 per copy of the risk allele, P = 0.03) and BMI (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None of the other previously reported SNPs were associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; however, associations were found between CDKAL1 and HHEX variants and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin response (AIR), where the Caucasian risk alleles for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0003059'>reduced insulin secretion</z:mp> in normoglycemic Pima Indians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multiallelic analyses of carrying risk alleles for multiple genes showed correlations between number of risk alleles and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948379" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">impaired insulin secretion</z:e> in normoglycemic subjects (P = 0.006 and 0.0001 for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and AIR, respectively), supporting the hypothesis that many of these genes influence <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk by affecting insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Variation in FTO impacts BMI, but the implicated common variants in the other genes did not confer a significant risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Pima Indians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, confidence intervals for their estimated effects were consistent with the small effects reported in Caucasians, and the multiallelic "genetic risk profile" identified in Caucasians is associated with diminished early insulin secretion in Pima Indians </plain></SENT>
