<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: With increasing emphasis on the recognition of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> and early type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, a clinically useful measure of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> is desirable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether an index of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism, as measured by (13)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> generation from ingested [(13)C]<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, would correlate with indexes from the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 26 subjects with varying degrees of insulin sensitivity underwent both the [(13)C]<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> breath test and the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results from the [(13)C]<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> breath test were compared with measures of insulin sensitivity from the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> clamp as well as with other commonly used indexes of insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a strong correlation between the [(13)C]<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> breath test result and the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal rate (r = 0.69, P &lt; 0.0001) and insulin sensitivity index (r = 0.69, P &lt; 0.0001) from the insulin clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of these correlations compared favorably with QUICKI and were superior to the homeostasis model assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The [(13)C]<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> breath test may provide a useful noninvasive assessment of insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
