<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, many patients still remained above target </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to evaluate which factors are associated with reaching program goals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a randomized, prospective, observational study in which patients enrolled in our program were followed for 2 years with outcomes, measures, and questionnaires assessed at baseline and at 6, 12, and 24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, A1C fell by 1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adherence to medication was the strongest predictor of reaching the target A1C of &lt;8%; baseline A1C was also predictive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Knowledge scores increased in those who reached target, but the measures of self-efficacy and empowerment did not change for either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> management is effective in a lower-income Latino population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, adherence was suboptimal even when medications were provided on-site for free </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further research into barriers associated with medication adherence is needed </plain></SENT>
