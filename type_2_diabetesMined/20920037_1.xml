<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As the life expectancy of persons with CF continues to increase, the need to proactively diagnose and aggressively treat CFRD and its potential complications has become more apparent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CFRD negatively impacts lung function, growth and mortality, making its diagnosis and management crucial in a population already at high risk for early mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared to type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, CFRD is a unique entity, requiring a thorough understanding of its unique pathophysiology to facilitate the creation and utilization of an effective medical treatment plan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> of CFRD is complex, likely consisting of a combination of insulin deficiency, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and a genetic predisposition towards the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the hallmark of CFRD is insulin deficiency, necessitating the use of exogenous insulin as the mainstay of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Insulin administration, in combination with a multidisciplinary team of health professionals with expertise in the care of patients with CF and CFRD, is the cornerstone of the care for these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The goals of treatment of the CFRD population are to reverse protein catabolism, maintain a healthy weight, and reduce <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Creating a partnership between the treatment team and the patient is the ideal way to accomplish these goals and is essential for successful <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care </plain></SENT>
