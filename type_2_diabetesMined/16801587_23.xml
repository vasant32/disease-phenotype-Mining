<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Subjects with NGT (n = 1,282) from the San Antonio Heart Study received an OGTT with measurement of the plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration at 0, 30, 60, and 120 min at baseline and after 7-8 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects were divided into four groups based on the relationship between the plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration during the OGTT and the FPG concentration on the same day as the OGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo> was calculated by the homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-IR) and Matsuda index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Early-phase insulin secretion was calculated as the ratio between the incremental plasma insulin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations during the first 30 min of the OGTT (DeltaI(0-30)/DeltaG(0-30)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Total insulin secretion was calculated as the ratio between the incremental areas under the insulin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> curves during the OGTT [DeltaG(AUC)/DeltaI(AUC)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 23 subjects (group I), the plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration during the OGTT returned to levels below the FPG concentration at 30 min; in 111 subjects (group II) and in 313 subjects (group III), the plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration during the OGTT returned to levels below the FPG concentration at 60 and 120 min, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 835 subjects (group IV), the plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration during the OGTT never fell below the FPG concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo>, measured by HOMA-IR and the Matsuda index, increased progressively from group I through group IV, while insulin secretion measured by DeltaI(0-30)/DeltaG(0-30) and DeltaG(AUC)/DeltaI(AUC) decreased progressively from group I through group IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 0% in group I and progressively increased to 0.9% in group II, 3.2% in group III, and 6.4% in group IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Subjects whose postload plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration returned to baseline (i.e., FPG level) more quickly had greater insulin sensitivity, a higher insulinogenic index, and a lower risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after 8 years of follow-up compared with subjects whose postload <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration returned to baseline more slowly </plain></SENT>
