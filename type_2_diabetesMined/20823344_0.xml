<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used a prospective registry of 5,280 Canadian patients in primary care settings enrolled in a 12-month glycemic pharmacotherapy optimization strategy based on national guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At close out, median A1C was 7.1% (vs. 7.8% at baseline) with 48% of subjects achieving A1C ≤ 7.0% (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Older patients of Asian or black origin, those with longer <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration, those with lower baseline A1C, BMI, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, and blood pressure, and those on angiotensin receptor blockers and a lower number of antihyperglycemic agents, were more likely to achieve A1C ≤ 7.0% at some point during the study (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.0235) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Access to private versus public drug coverage did not impact glycemic target realization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patient demography, cardiometabolic health, and ongoing pharmacotherapy, but not access to private drug insurance coverage, contribute to the care gap in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
