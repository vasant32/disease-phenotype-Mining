<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Six abnormally expressed genes were isolated from the mice after a 3-month fat feeding; one of them was cathepsin L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No significant difference in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of these genes was observed between fat- and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-diet conditions in either strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, cathepsin L <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels in muscle were higher in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> diet-fed C57BL/6J mice compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> diet-fed NMRI mice at 3 months (0.72 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.51 +/- 0.04 relative units, P &lt; 0.01, n = 8-10) and at 15 months (0.41 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.27 +/- 0.04 relative units, P = 0.01, n = 9-10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further, cathepsin L <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels in muscle correlated inversely with plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in both strains regardless of diets at 3 (r = -0.49, P &lt; 0.01, n = 31) and 15 (r = -0.42, P = 0.007, n = 39) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To study whether cathepsin L plays a role in human <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we measured cathepsin L <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels in muscle biopsies taken before and after an insulin clamp from 12 monozygotic twin pairs discordant for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and from 12 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Basal cathepsin L <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were not significantly different between the study groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Insulin infusion increased cathepsin L <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels in control subjects from 1.03 +/- 0.30 to 1.90 +/- 0.32 relative units (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Postclamp cathepsin L <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were lower in diabetic twins but similar in nondiabetic twins compared with control subjects (0.66 +/- 0.22, 1.16 +/- 0.18 vs. 1.38 +/- 0.21 relative units, P &lt; 0.02, NS, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further, postclamp cathepsin L <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were correlated with insulin-mediated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake (r = 0.37, P = 0.03), particularly, with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> oxidation (r = 0.37, P = 0.03), and fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations (r = -0.45, P &lt; 0.01) across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three study groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, muscle cathepsin L gene expression is increased in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-prone mice and related to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In humans, insulin-stimulated cathepsin L expression in skeletal muscle is impaired in diabetic but not in nondiabetic monozygotic twins, suggesting that the changes may be secondary to impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
