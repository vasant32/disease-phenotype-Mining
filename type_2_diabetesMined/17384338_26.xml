<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Resistin, secreted from adipocytes, causes <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in rodents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that the G/G genotype of a resistin gene promoter single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at -420 increases type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility by enhancing promoter activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report here on the relation between plasma resistin and either SNP -420 genotype or factors related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We cross-sectionally analyzed 2,078 community-dwelling Japanese subjects attending a yearly medical checkup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The SNP -420 genotype was determined by TaqMan analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fasting plasma resistin was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Plasma resistin was associated with the SNP -420 genotype (P &lt; 0.0001), which was highest in G/G followed by C/G and C/C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasma resistin was higher in elderly individuals, female subjects, nondrinkers, and subjects with <z:mp ids='MP_0002842'>high blood pressure</z:mp> (P &lt; 0.001, 0.003, &lt;0.001, and 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Simple regression analysis revealed that age, female sex, homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-IR) index, systolic blood pressure, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003233'>low HDL cholesterol</z:hpo>, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were positively correlated with plasma resistin (P &lt; 0.001, 0.003, &lt;0.001, 0.004, &lt;0.001, and 0.003, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multiple regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, and BMI revealed that plasma resistin was an independent factor for HOMA-IR, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003233'>low HDL cholesterol</z:hpo>, and hs-CRP (P = 0.001, &lt;0.001, and 0.006, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Plasma resistin was associated with SNP -420 and was correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, low serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, and high hs-CRP in the Japanese general population </plain></SENT>
