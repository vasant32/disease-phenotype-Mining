<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied whether these alterations also exist in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) and whether they are determinants of insulin sensitivity and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance in postmenopausal women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Percutaneous muscle biopsies from the vastus lateralis muscle were obtained from 77 postmenopausal women aged 57-59 years: 50 women with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (NGT) and 27 with IGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The IGT group had a reduced insulin sensitivity compared with the NGT group (euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp) (P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The groups did not differ in muscle fiber composition, as judged by the percentage of type I, IIa, or IIx fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the IGT group had <z:mp ids='MP_0001264'>increased size</z:mp> of the IIa (mean +/-SD 3,776+/-987 vs. 3,078+/-862 microm2, P = 0.002) and IIx fibers (2,730+/-1,037 vs. 2,253+/-672 microm2, P = 0.017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a trend for the capillary diffusion areas (the muscle area supplied by each capillary) to be larger in the IGT group for the IIa (1,132+/-286 vs. 1,013+/-240 microm2, P = 0.061) and IIx fibers (1,020+/-246 vs. 906+/-240 microm2, P = 0.058) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the entire group, insulin sensitivity correlated with the size of the type IIa fibers (r = -0.28, P = 0.013), but not with the percentages of muscle fiber types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a multiple regression, insulin sensitivity was determined by body fat content and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> level, while the size of the IIa fibers was not included in the model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> tolerance was independently predicted by the number of capillaries/type I fiber, as well as by insulin sensitivity and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that although muscle fiber composition is not altered, women with IGT have larger type IIa and IIx muscle fibers and a trend for increased capillary diffusion areas for these fibers, compared with women with NGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the entire group, insulin sensitivity was determined mainly by body fat content, while muscle fiber capillarization may be of importance for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
