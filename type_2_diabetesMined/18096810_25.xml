<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine 1) whether participants in the Spanish <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Self-Management Program (SDSMP), when compared at 6 months to randomized control subjects, would demonstrate improvements in health status, health behaviors, and self-efficacy; and 2) whether SDSMP participants receiving monthly automated telephone reinforcement would maintain improvements at 18 months better than those not receiving reinforcement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 567 Spanish-speaking adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were randomized to a usual-care control group or 6-week community-based, peer-led SDSMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SDSMP participants were re-randomized to receive 15 months of automated telephone messages or no reinforcement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A1C was measured at baseline and 6 and 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> other data were collected by self-administered questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At 6 months SDSMP participants compared with control subjects demonstrated improvements in A1C (-0.4%), health distress, symptoms of hypo- and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, and self-efficacy (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 18 months <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> improvements persisted (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SDSMP participants also demonstrated improvements in self-rated health and communication with physicians, had fewer emergency room visits (-0.18 visits in 6 months, P &lt; 0.05), and trended toward fewer visits to physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 18 months the only difference between reinforced and nonreinforced participants was increased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring for the reinforcement group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The SDSMP demonstrated effectiveness in lowering A1C and improving health status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Reinforcement did not add to its effectiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Given the high needs of the Spanish-speaking population, the SDSMP deserves consideration for implementation </plain></SENT>
