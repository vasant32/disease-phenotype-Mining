<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In recent years, several alternative dietary approaches, including high-protein and low-glycaemic-load diets, have produced faster rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> than traditional low-fat, high-carbohydrate diets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These diets share an under-recognised unifying mechanism: the reduction of postprandial glycaemia and insulinaemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Similarly, some food patterns and specific foods (potatoes, white bread, soft drinks) characterised by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> are associated with higher risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Profound compensatory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020459" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperinsulinaemia</z:e>, exacerbated by overweight, occurs during critical periods of physiological <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> such as pregnancy and puberty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The dramatic rise in <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the young may therefore be traced to food patterns that exaggerate postprandial glycaemia and insulinaemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The dietary strategy with the strongest evidence of being able to prevent type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is not the accepted low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet, but alternative dietary approaches that reduce postprandial glycaemia and insulinaemia without adversely affecting other risk factors </plain></SENT>
