<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analysed bone mineral density (BMD) measured at the hip, spine and forearm using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry in 34 patients with type 1 and 194 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were from the community-based Fremantle <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study, and findings for them were compared with those from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> age- and sex-matched control subjects from the local community </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Biochemical and hormonal markers of bone metabolism were measured in a subset of 70 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After adjusting for age and BMI, there was a lower BMD at total hip (p&lt;0.001) and femoral neck (p=0.012) in type 1 men vs control subjects, but type 1 women and matched controls had similar BMD at each site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a higher BMD at total hip (p=0.006), femoral neck (p=0.026) and forearm (p&lt;0.001) in type 2 women vs control subjects, but <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> status was not associated with BMD in type 2 men after adjustment for age and BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23965">oestradiol</z:chebi>, BMI, C-terminal telopeptide of collagen type 1 and male sex were consistently and independently associated with BMD at forearm, hip and femoral neck and explained 61, 55 and 50% of the total variance in BMD, respectively, at these sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Spine BMD was independently associated with BMI and ln(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="23965">oestradiol</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Men with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may be at increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo>, while type 2 women appear to be protected even after adjusting for BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Low serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23965">oestradiol</z:chebi> concentrations may predispose to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> regardless of sex </plain></SENT>
