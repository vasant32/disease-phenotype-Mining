<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of a simple nurse-based prompt on fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> screening and counseling regarding diet, exercise and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> to persons at increased risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients at risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were recruited from 10 primary care practices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nurses were trained to score a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk assessment and prompt providers concerning <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> high-risk subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to determine the association between the nurse prompt and subsequent fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> testing or receiving advice for diet, exercise, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 1176 subjects, 597 were recruited from intervention practices and 579 from control practices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In both the univariate and multivariate models, the intervention group was more likely to receive fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> testing and advice for diet, exercise and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate model, patients in the intervention group were more likely to receive fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> testing (odds ratio 9.3, 95% confidence interval 3.6-24.0), dietary advice (6.1, 3.5-10.7), exercise advice (7.4, 4.0-13.9), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> advice (1.9, 1.1-3.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A simple nurse-based prompt is an effective tool to increase screening and preventive services for people at risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
