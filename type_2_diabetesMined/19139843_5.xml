<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We compared brain responses to food images of 11 people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 12 healthy control participants, matched for age and weight, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Having type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> increased responses to pictured foods in the insula, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and basal ganglia and, within these regions, the effect of the fat content of the foods was larger in participants with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than in healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, increased activation to food within the insula and OFC positively correlated with external eating, dietary self-efficacy and dietary self-care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, responses within subcortical structures (amygdala and basal ganglia) were positively correlated with emotional eating and rated appetite for the food stimuli and negatively correlated with dietary self-care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is associated with changes in brain responses to food that are modulated by dietary self-care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We propose that this is linked to the need to follow a life-long restrictive diet </plain></SENT>
