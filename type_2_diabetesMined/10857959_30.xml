<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 13 type 2 diabetic patients (aged 51+/-2 years, weight 110+/-5 kg, BMI 41+/-1 kg/m2, fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> [FSG] 11.5+/-0.9 mmol/l) (means+/-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) and 10 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> control subjects (48+/-3 years, 98+/-6 kg, 37+/-2 kg/m2, FSG 5.5+/-0.3 mmol/l) consumed an ISO, 1.5 g x kg(-1) x day(-1) protein for a body weight corresponding to a BMI of 25 (BMI25), a formula diet (7 days for <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> control subjects, 15 days for diabetic patients), and then a 28-day LED with 50% of the energy of ISO but the same protein intake (101+/-2 g/day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OHAs were given during ISO (days 8-15) and LED </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On days 6-8 (and 12-14 for diabetic subjects) of ISO and 26-28 of LED, the 60-h oral <z:chebi fb="1" ids="36934">15N</z:chebi>-glycine method was used to obtain nitrogen flux (Q), synthesis (S), and breakdown (B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Muscle protein catabolism was estimated from N(tau)-methylhistidine (3MH) excretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During ISO with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, Q, and B adjusted for fat-free mass, sex, and age were higher and nitrogen balance and net endogenous protein synthesis (S-B) lower than in control subjects (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>OHA decreased FSG (9+/-1 mmol/l) and 3MH and increased plasma insulin-to-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> ratio, nitrogen retention, and S-B to levels in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The change in S-B correlated with that in FSG (r = -0.845, P = 0.001) and in fasting plasma C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (r = 0.852, P = 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With LED and OHA, weight decreased 6.3 kg, glycemia reached near-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels, and nitrogen equilibrium was maintained; Q decreased by 7%, S and B by 11% (P&lt;0.05) to values found in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: OHA during ISO corrected protein turnover in relation to glycemia and plasma C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The LED maintained protein homeostasis in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> control subjects and, in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients with OHA, normalized protein metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings have implications for diet and OHA prescription </plain></SENT>
