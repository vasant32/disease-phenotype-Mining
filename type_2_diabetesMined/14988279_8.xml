<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Various observational and randomized studies have demonstrated a reduction in the incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in postmenopausal women who received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> orally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No studies have been performed on the incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in postmenopausal women treated with transdermal 17-beta-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of our study was to assess the influence of transdermal 17-beta-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> on the incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a population of healthy, nonobese postmenopausal women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Between January 1998 and December 2002, 673 healthy, nonobese postmenopausal women (mean age 54 +/- 5 years) were enrolled: 144 (21.4%) of these took transdermal 17-beta-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> and 529 (78.6%) had never taken hormones during their postmenopausal period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Final elaboration of the data took place in July 2003, with a mean follow-up of 3.7 +/- 0.7 years (ranging from 0.5 to 5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> developed in 60 patients during the follow-up period, which is the equivalent of 22 cases per 1,000 women-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the "hormones nonusers" group, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> developed in 10% (54 of 529 women; equivalent of 26.5 cases/1,000 women-years), whereas in the "hormones users" group, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> developed in 4.16% (6 of 144 women; equivalent of 12.1 cases/1,000 women-years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transdermal 17-beta-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> emerged as a treatment that significantly reduced the risk of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (RR 2.19, 95% CI 1.79-3.56; P=0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a significant reduction in the incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in our population of nonobese, healthy postmenopausal women who used transdermal 17-beta-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This could suggest that, in some women, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> deficiency that occurs after menopause could represent a fundamental step in the process of diabetogenesis </plain></SENT>
