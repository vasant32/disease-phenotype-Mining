<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two major reports have recently revised the classification of and diagnostic criteria for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Classification was previously based on the need for insulin (insulin-dependent or non-insulin-dependent), but this has become increasingly confusing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Now, the type of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is determined by the etiological process rather than the treatment modality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is thus characterized by islet cell destruction and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by a combination of defects in insulin secretion and action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An individual with either type of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may be on any treatment modality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This classification should prove to be more logical and, for example, allow latent autoimmune <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in adults, which typically does not require insulin at presentation, to be classified as type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> diagnostic threshold for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> has been lowered to 7.0 mmol/l (126 mg/dl), and impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> 6.1-6.9 mmol/l [110-125 mg/dl]) has been introduced as a new category of intermediate <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These changes recognize that the old fasting threshold did not match the 2-h (postload) threshold well and that both micro- and macrovascular disease develop at lower fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels than previously recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although the prevalences of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> according to the new fasting and 2-h criteria are now similar in most populations, the actual individuals identified as having <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are often different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Over 30% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> those with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have a nondiabetic fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> but still have increased cardiovascular mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is important to retain the oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test for the diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
