<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This study is a randomized clinical trial of 105 overweight adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Primary outcomes were weight and A1C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Secondary outcomes included blood pressure and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Outcome measures were obtained at 3, 6, and 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The greatest reduction in weight and A1C occurred within the first 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>Weight loss</z:hpo> occurred faster in the low-carbohydrate group than in the low-fat group (P = 0.005), but at 1 year a similar 3.4% weight reduction was seen in both dietary groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant change in A1C in either group at 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no change in blood pressure, but a greater increase in <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> was observed in the low-carbohydrate group (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, after 1 year a low-carbohydrate diet had effects on weight and A1C similar to those seen with a low-fat diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no significant effect on blood pressure, but the low-carbohydrate diet produced a greater increase in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
