<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed at evaluating associations between NRF1 genetic polymorphisms and development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using a variation screening approach, 6 novel and 10 known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the NRF1 gene were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nine SNPs were then selected using pairwise tagging with an r(2) cutoff of 0.8 and/or minor allele frequency of &gt;5% and genotyped in 596 type 2 diabetic patients and 431 nondiabetic subjects, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom were Han Chinese </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two novel SNPs (-46127T&gt;C and +98560A&gt;G) were associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P = 0.018 and 0.036; for possession of minor allele, odds ratio [OR] 0.620 and 3.199, with dominant model and correction for multiple comparisons) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In SNP rs1882094 (+141G&gt;T), the nondiabetic control subjects carrying GG genotype had lower fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels than carriers with other genotypes (P = 0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One common haplotype (H2) mainly composed of SNPs rs6969098 (-24833 A&gt;G), rs1882094, and another novel variant (+97884G&gt;A) was significantly associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P = 0.016, OR 0.706) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subjects with this haplotype had lower fasting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels when compared with those with other haplotypes (P = 0.010) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows an association of SNPs in the NRF1 gene with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a Han Chinese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>NRF1 genetic polymorphisms may be a suspectibility factor for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by conferring abnormalities in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies should replicate this finding using larger and racially diverse populations </plain></SENT>
