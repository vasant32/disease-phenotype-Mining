<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a 12-week, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 423 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with suboptimal metabolic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Following a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in, patients aged 18-75 years with a body mass index of 25-48 kg/m(2) and baseline HbA1c of 7.3-11.0% were randomized 2:2:1 to receive once-daily oral therapy with either dutogliptin (400 or 200 mg) or placebo on a background medication of either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> alone, a thiazolidinedione (TZD) alone or a combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> plus a TZD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Average HbA1c at baseline was 8.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Administration of dutogliptin 400 and 200 mg for 12 weeks decreased HbA1c by -0.52% (p &lt; 0.001) and -0.35% (p = 0.006), respectively (placebo-corrected values), with absolute changes in HbA1c for the 400 mg, 200 mg and placebo groups of -0.82, -0.64 and -0.3%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The proportion of patients achieving an HbA1c &lt; 7% was 27, 21 and 12% at dutogliptin doses of 400 and 200 mg or placebo, respectively (p = 0.008 for comparison of 400 mg vs. placebo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) levels were significantly reduced in both active treatment groups compared to placebo: the placebo-corrected difference was -1.00 mmol/l (p &lt; 0.001) for the 400 mg group and -0.88 mmol/l (p = 0.003) for the 200 mg group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Dutogliptin caused significantly greater reductions in postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> AUC (0-2h) in both the 400 and 200 mg groups (placebo corrected values -2.58 mmol/l/h, p &lt; 0.001 and -1.63 mmol/l/h, p = 0.032, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In general, patients tolerated the study drug well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were minor, not clinically meaningful differences in adverse events (AEs) between dutogliptin-treated patients and placebo controls, and 60% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> reported AEs were mild </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Vital signs and body weight were stable, and routine safety laboratory parameters did not change compared with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Trough ex vivo DPP4 inhibition at the end of the 12-week treatment period was 80 and 70%, at the 400 and 200 mg doses of dutogliptin, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Dutogliptin treatment for 12 weeks improved glycaemic control in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were on a background medication of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, a TZD or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> plus a TZD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Tolerability was favourable for both doses tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The 400 mg dose of dutogliptin resulted in larger changes of HbA1c and FPG and more subjects reached an HbA1c target of &lt; 7% than the 200 mg dose </plain></SENT>
