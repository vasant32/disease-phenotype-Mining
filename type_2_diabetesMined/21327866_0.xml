<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanism(s) contributing to the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> sensitivity of glucagon release and its impaired regulation in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A paper in the current issue of Diabetologia by da Silva Xavier and colleagues (doi: 10.1007/s00125-010-2010-7 ) provides intriguing new insight into a metabolic sensing pathway mediated by the per-arnt-sim (<z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi>) domain kinase (PASK) that may contribute to both the paracrine and the intrinsic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> regulation of alpha cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Importantly, the authors show that PASK is decreased in islets from patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, providing a potential mechanism for impaired suppression of glucagon by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> in this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Much work remains to be done to determine the exact role and mechanism of PASK in alpha and beta cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the present work introduces a new player in the metabolic regulation of glucagon secretion </plain></SENT>
