<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: While high parity is hypothesized to be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, few studies have examined this association in diverse racial samples or geographical areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objectives were to estimate the magnitude of association between parity and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and to determine if higher parity is predictive of future risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a population-based, prospective cohort study of 7,024 Caucasian and African-American women from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Risk in Communities study, a prospective epidemiological study of men and women aged 45-64 years, with 9 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was defined by the 1997 American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association diagnostic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Parity was defined as the number of live births (no live births [nulliparity], one to two live births, three to four live births, and five or more live births [grandmultiparity]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Parity and risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was estimated for 754 incident cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with Cox proportional hazard regression models, adjusting for sociodemographic, clinical, and lifestyle factors and inflammatory markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Incidence rates were highest among women with five or more live births (23/1,000 person-years [95% CI 20.3-26.7]) and lowest among women with one to two live births (11/1,000 person-years [9.6-12.5]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adjustment indicated that much of the risk was due to sociodemographic factors and higher <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, but after adjustment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> covariates, grandmultiparity (five or more) was still associated with a 27% increased risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (hazard ratio 1.27 [95% CI 1.02-1.57]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Grandmultiparity is predictive of future risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after adjustment for confounders </plain></SENT>
