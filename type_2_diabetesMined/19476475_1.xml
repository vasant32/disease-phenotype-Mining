<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that it is associated with more hunger when treated by medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied nine type 2 diabetic men (A1C: 6.7+/-0.3%, waist circumference: 104+/-4 cm) after an overnight fast, during 5 h in response to a 2.88 MJ breakfast, twice, in a crossover design, with or without antihyperglycaemic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Satiety ratings, thermic effect of meal, gastric emptying, plasma concentrations of gut <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi>, leptin, insulin and substrates and intake from a subsequent buffet were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: With medication, fasting and postprandial plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were lower but area under the curve (AUC) did not vary vs. without medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Gastric emptying was shortened, branched chain amino acids (BCAA) AUC and thermic effect were lower, and postprandial glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> tyrosine tyrosine (PYY3-36) were maintained at higher levels beyond 4 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Correlations were significant between duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and fasting ghrelin (r=0.779, p=0.013) and peak insulin (r=-0.769, p=0.016), 5-h postmeal ghrelin and peak <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (r=0.822, p=0.007), 5-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and GLP-1 (r=-0.788, p=0.012), and 5-h hunger scores and energy intake at buffet (r=0.828, p=0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Without medication, fullness scores correlated with BCAA levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Visual analogue scale scores, ghrelin and leptin levels did not differ between studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The decrease in factors associated with postprandial satiety with treatment is counterbalanced by higher GLP-1 and PYY3-36 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Medication may normalize the link between perception of hunger and subsequent food intake </plain></SENT>
