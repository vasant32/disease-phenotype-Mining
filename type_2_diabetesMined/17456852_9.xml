<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are characterized by an approximately 98 and approximately 65% loss of pancreatic beta-cells, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Efforts to reverse either form of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> increasingly focus on the possibility of promoting beta-cell replacement and/or regeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Islet transplantation has been explored, but it does not provide long-term insulin independence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One possible source of beta-cell regeneration is hematopoietic stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In mice, there are conflicting data as to whether hematopoietic stem cells contribute to pancreatic beta-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We sought to establish whether hematopoietic stem cells (derived from adult donors) transdifferentiate into pancreatic beta-cells in adult humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We addressed this in 31 human pancreata obtained at autopsy from hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients who had received their transplant from a donor of the opposite sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Whereas some donor-derived cells were observed in the nonendocrine pancreata, no pancreatic beta-cells were identified that were derived from donor hematopoietic stem cells, including two cases with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that hematopoietic stem cells derived from adult donors contribute minimally to pancreatic beta-cells in nondiabetic adult humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data do not rule out the possibility that hematopoietic stem cells contribute to pancreatic beta-cells in childhood or in individuals with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
