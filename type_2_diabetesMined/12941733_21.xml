<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To conduct a literature review of community-based interventions intended to prevent or delay type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Recently published findings about the potential to prevent or delay type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with intensive lifestyle interventions prompted a literature search for community-based <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The literature review design was a search of databases for publications in 1990-2001 that identified reports on community-based interventions designed to prevent or modify risk factors for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The search revealed 16 published interventions, 8 of which were conducted in the U.S. and involved populations disproportionately burdened by <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (e.g., American Indians, Native Hawaiians, Mexican Americans, and African Americans) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the studies reporting results among youth, there were posttest improvements in intervention groups in knowledge, preventive behaviors, and self-esteem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among studies reporting results among adults, most reported improvements in intervention groups in knowledge or adoption of regular physical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Several investigators offered important reflections about the process of engaging communities and sharing decision making in participatory research approaches, as well as insights about the expectations and limitations of community-based <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Many of the studies reported limitations in their design, including the lack of control or comparison groups, low response rates or lack of information on nonresponders, or brief intervention periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is a critical need to conduct and publish reports on well-designed community-based <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention research and share information on the process, results, and lessons learned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Armed with recent positive findings about <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention and literature documenting community-based efforts, advocates at local, state, and national levels can collaborate to stem the rising tide of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in communities </plain></SENT>
