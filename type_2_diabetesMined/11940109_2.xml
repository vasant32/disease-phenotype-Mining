<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: HCYS was measured in a cohort of 584 Saudi Arabians participating in a national screening study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> (CHD) risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 173 subjects (114 men and 59 women) had clinical CHD, of whom 82 (47.4%) had type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (56 men and 26 women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A further 127 subjects (60 men and 67 women) also had type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> but no CHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 284 individuals (120 men and 164 women) were recruited as healthy controls, and had no previous history of CHD or <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum HCYS was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with electrochemical detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Univariate analysis showed HCYS concentrations were significantly lower in those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM) than in controls, for both men [8.7 (4.2-18.6) vs. 10.5 (4.5-20.5) mmol/l, median (5th-95th percentiles, p = 0.009] and women [6.3 (3.3-24.0) vs. 8.1 (4.0-17.9) mmol/l, p = 0.049] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Stepwise multivariate regression analysis indicated a relationship between HCYS concentration and age, sex and the presence of DM, but not with CHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the Saudi Arabian population, serum HCYS is not a risk factor for CHD, but is lower in patients with DM </plain></SENT>
