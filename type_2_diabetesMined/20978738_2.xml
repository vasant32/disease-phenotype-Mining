<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is caused by relative deficiency of insulin secretion and is associated with dysregulation of glucagon secretion during the late stage of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Like insulin secretion from beta cells, glucagon secretion is dependent on calcium signals and a calcium sensing protein, synaptotagmin-7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we tested the relative contribution of dysregulated glucagon secretion and reduced insulin release in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by using synaptotagmin-7 knockout (KO) mice, which exhibit <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0003059'>reduced insulin secretion</z:mp> and nearly abolished Ca(2+)-stimulated glucagon secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We fed the synaptotagmin-7 KO and control mice with a high-fat diet (HFD) for 14 weeks, and compared their body weight, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin tolerance, and insulin and glucagon secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On the HFD, synaptotagmin-7 KO mice showed progressive impairment of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance and insulin secretion, along with continued maintenance of a low glucagon level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The control mice were less affected in terms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo>, and showed enhanced insulin secretion with a concurrent increase in glucagon levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, after 14 weeks of HFD feeding, only the control mice displayed resting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e>, whereas in synaptotagmin-7 KO mice defective insulin secretion and reduced insulin sensitivity were not sufficient to cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> in the absence of enhanced glucagon secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our data uncover a previously overlooked role of dysregulated glucagon secretion in promoting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> and the ensuing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and strongly suggest maintenance of adequate regulation of glucagon secretion as an important therapeutic target in addition to the preservation of beta cell function and mass in the prevention and treatment of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
