<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 70 inactive people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were given standard exercise information and were randomized to receive an exercise consultation (n = 35) or not (n = 35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Exercise consultation, based on the transtheoretical model, combines motivational theory and cognitive behavioral strategies into an individualized intervention to promote physical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Changes from baseline to 6 months were assessed in 1) physical activity (7-day recall, accelerometer, cardiorespiratory fitness, stage, and processes of change), 2) physiological variables (blood pressure and BMI), and 3) biochemical variables (HbA(1c), <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile, and fibrinogen) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between-group differences were recorded for the change in minutes of moderate activity (P &lt; 0.001) and activity counts (P &lt; 0.001) per week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Experimental participants recorded an increase in activity counts per week and minutes of moderate activity per week (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The control group recorded no significant changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>More experimental participants increased stage of change (chi(2) = 22.6, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Between-group differences were recorded for the change in total exercise duration and peak gradient (P &lt; 0.005), HbA(1c) (P = 0.02), systolic BP (P = 0.02), and fibrinogen (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Exercise consultation increased physical activity and improved glycemic control and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
