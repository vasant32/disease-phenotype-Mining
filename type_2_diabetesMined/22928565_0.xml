<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whilst both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the development of the disease, relatively little is known about the molecular network that is responsible for diet-induced functional changes in pancreatic ��-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent genome-wide association studies for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related traits have generated a large number of candidate genes that constitute possible links between dietary factors and the genetic susceptibility for β-cell failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we summarize recent approaches for identifying nutritionally regulated transcripts in islets on a genome-wide scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Polygenic mouse models for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have been instrumental for investigating the mechanism of diet-induced β-cell dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Enhanced oxidative metabolism, triggered by a combination of dietary carbohydrates and fat, appears to play a critical role in the pathophysiology of diet-induced impairment of islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More systematic studies of gene-diet interactions in β-cells of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519106" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">rodent models</z:e> in combination with genetic profiling might reveal the regulatory circuits fundamental for the understanding of diet-induced impairments of β-cell function in humans </plain></SENT>
