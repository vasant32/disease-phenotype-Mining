<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previously, we reported that this response was negatively regulated by G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated whether/how in aortas from ob/ob mice (a model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) GRK2 and β-arrestin 2 might regulate insulin-induced signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Endothelium-dependent relaxation was measured in aortic strips </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>GRK2, β-arrestin 2, and Akt/eNOS signaling pathway proteins and activities were mainly assayed by Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In ob/ob (vs. control [Lean]) aortas: 1) insulin-induced relaxation was reduced, and this deficit was prevented by GRK2 inhibitor, anti-GRK2 antibody, and an siRNA specifically targeting GRK2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Lean aorta relaxation response was reduced to the ob/ob level by pretreatment with an siRNA targeting β-arrestin 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>2) Insulin-stimulated Akt and eNOS phosphorylations were decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>3) GRK2 expression in membranes was elevated, and, upon insulin stimulation, this expression was further increased, but β-arrestin 2 was decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In ob/ob aortic membranes under insulin stimulation, the phosphorylations of Akt and eNOS were augmented by GRK2 inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In mouse aorta, GRK2 may be, upon translocation, a key negative regulator of insulin responsiveness and an important regulator of the β-arrestin 2/Akt/eNOS signaling, which is implicated in diabetic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
