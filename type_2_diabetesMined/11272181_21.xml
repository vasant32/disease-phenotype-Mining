<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is characterized by a progressive loss of beta-cell function throughout the course of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pattern of loss is an initial defect in early or first-phase insulin secretion, followed by a decreasing maximal capacity of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> to potentiate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> nonglucose signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Last, a defective steady-state and basal insulin secretion develops, leading to complete beta-cell failure requiring insulin treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This functional loss exceeds the expected impact of a 20-50% loss of beta-cells reported at autopsy, which has been associated with amyloid deposits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This review summarizes the nature of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_34'>amyloid deposition</z:mpath> process and its association with disproportionate hyperproinsulinemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It reviews recent studies in IAPP (islet-amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi>, or amylin) transgenic mice developing islet amyloid deposits and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> to suggest that the process of amyloid fibril formation impairs function early and leads to beta-cell failure and eventual <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on the known association of amyloid deposits and relative hyperproinsulinemia, it is hypothesized that fibril formation begins during <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> after other factors cause the initial defects in early insulin secretion and insulin action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, the process that leads to beta-cell loss is implicated in the deposition of amyloid and the late unrelenting progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> now found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients despite current therapies </plain></SENT>
