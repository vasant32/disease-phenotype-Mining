<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two HNF4A SNPs (rs1885088 G&gt;A; rs745975 C&gt;T), previously reported to be associated with T2DM, were studied in 528 non-diabetic subjects who underwent a 75g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi>, insulin and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> plasma levels, measured in the fasting state and during the OGTT, were used in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The amount (hours per week) of PA was assessed by questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The HNF4A rs1885088 SNP was not independently associated with T2DM-related traits, whereas the rs745975 was associated with fasting insulin, HOMA-IR and 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels (p&lt;0.05 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genotype by PA interactions were found for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis (p&lt;0.0001) and insulin secretion (p&lt;or=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When subjects were stratified by PA level (according to the median value), we found that high level of PA (&gt;2h/week) was associated with smaller <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> area under the curve (AUC) and 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels in rs1885088 A/A homozygotes and with lower fasting C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> and insulin AUC in rs745975 T/T homozygotes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results indicate that the associations of HNF4A rs1885088 with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance and rs745975 with insulin secretion are modulated by PA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our finding therefore suggests that the effect of HNF4A polymorphisms on the risk of T2DM is influenced by PA </plain></SENT>
