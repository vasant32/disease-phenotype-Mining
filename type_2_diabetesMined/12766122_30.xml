<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe the use of oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs for management of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the U.S. from 1990 through 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data on oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs were derived from two pharmaceutical marketing databases from IMS Health, the National Prescription Audit Plus and the National Disease and Therapeutic Index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 1990, 23.4 million outpatient prescriptions of oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> agents were dispensed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By 2001, this number had increased 3.9-fold, to 91.8 million prescriptions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Glipizide and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi>, two <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> medications, accounted for approximately 77% of prescriptions of oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs in 1990 and 35.5% of prescriptions in 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By 2001, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3095">biguanide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (approved in 1995) had captured approximately 33% of prescriptions, and the thiazolidinedione <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">insulin sensitizers</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> marketed beginning in 1999) accounted for approximately 17% of market share </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with patients treated in 1990, those in 2001 were proportionately younger and they more often used oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs and insulin in combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Internists and general and family practitioners were the primary prescribers of this class of drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with the reported increase in the prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the number of dispensed outpatient prescriptions of oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs increased rapidly between 1990 and 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This period was marked by an increase in the treatment of younger people and the use of oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs in combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>With the approval in the last decade of several new types of oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> medications with different mechanisms of action, options for management of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have expanded </plain></SENT>
