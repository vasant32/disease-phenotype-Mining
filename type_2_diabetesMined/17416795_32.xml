<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Recent investigations disclosed an upregulation of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50211">retinol</z:chebi>-binding protein-4 (RBP4) in the adipose tissue of several insulin-resistant mouse models and increased serum RBP4 concentration in subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is some experimental evidence that RBP4 also could been linked to insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We aimed to evaluate insulin secretion, insulin sensitivity, insulin disposition index (minimal model analysis), and circulating RBP4 (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) in nondiabetic men with a wide range of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (n = 107) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum RBP4 concentration was nonsignificantly different among lean, overweight, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Circulating RBP4 was not associated with age, BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, or metabolic parameters, including insulin sensitivity (r = -0.03, P = 0.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, circulating RBP4 was negatively associated with insulin secretion, especially in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects (r = -0.48, P = 0.007), in whom RBP4 also was linked to insulin disposition index (r = -0.44, P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On multiple regression analyses to predict insulin secretion (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin response [AIR(g)]), insulin sensitivity was the only factor that contributed to 17% of AIR(g) variance in nonobese subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects, however, RBP4 emerged as an independent factor that contributed independently to AIR(g) variance (23%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that oversecretion of RBP4 may negatively affect beta-cell function directly or by preventing the binding of transthyretin to its receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These mechanisms could be behind the association between increased circulating RBP4 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RBP4 could be one signal from insulin-resistant tissues that impacts on beta-cell secretion </plain></SENT>
