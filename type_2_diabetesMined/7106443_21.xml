<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The incidence of Type 1 (insulin-dependent) <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in this age group varied little between the towns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the incidence of Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was markedly higher in the towns with 'worse' socio-economic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean incidences were 23 per 100 000 for the three 'worse' towns and 10 per 100 000 for the three 'better' towns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was not explicable by an association between the disease and social class </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This finding has to be reconciled with known and hypothesised influences in the aetiology of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
