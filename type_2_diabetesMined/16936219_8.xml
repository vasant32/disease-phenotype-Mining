<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous investigations of the ACE gene as a susceptibility factor for diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> have primarily focused on its insertion/deletion (Ins/Del) polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a departure from these earlier studies, we used three tagging markers (A-5466C, T-3892C, and Ins/Del) at the ACE locus to test for disease haplotype associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A case-control study design was used where case subjects were type 2 diabetic patients with advanced diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, as indicated by the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>chronic renal failure</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal disease</z:hpo>, while control subjects were normoalbuminuric, despite &gt;6 years of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>None of the individual markers showed significant disease association when considered on their own </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, haplotype analyses revealed a near doubling in the prevalence of the A.T.D risk haplotype in case subjects (0.136) compared with control subjects (0.075) (P = 0.009), thus providing first evidence for a disease haplotype for advanced diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> at the ACE locus </plain></SENT>
