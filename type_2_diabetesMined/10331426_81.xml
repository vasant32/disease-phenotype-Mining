<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Considerable evidence supports a major inherited component of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We initially conducted a genome-wide scan with 440 microsatellite markers at 10-cM intervals in 19 multigenerational families of Northern European ancestry with at least two diabetic siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Initial two-point analyses of these families directed marker typing of 23 additional families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> available marker data on the total of 42 families were analyzed using both parametric and nonparametric multipoint methods to test for linkage to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One locus on chromosome 1q21-1q23 met genome-wide criteria for significant linkage under a model of recessive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> with a common <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> allele (logarithm of odds [LOD] = 4.295) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both pedigree-based nonparametric linkage (NPL) analysis and affected sib pair (MAPMAKER/SIBS) nonparametric methods also showed the highest genome-wide scores at this region, near markers CRP and APOA2, but failed to meet levels of genome-wide significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> to siblings of a diabetic person when compared with the population (lambdaS) was estimated from MAPMAKER/SIBS to be 2.8 in these 42 families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Simulation studies using study data confirmed a genome-wide significance level of P&lt;0.05 (95% CI 0.005-0.0466) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, analysis of 20 similarly ascertained but smaller families failed to confirm this linkage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The LOD score with 50% <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 62 families considered together was only 2.25, with an estimated lambdaS of 1.87 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest a novel <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility locus near APOA2 on chromosome 1 in a region with many transcribed genes </plain></SENT>
