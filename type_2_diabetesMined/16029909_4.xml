<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Blood flow was also measured following infusion of N(G)-monomethyl-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> into the brachial artery to inhibit basal NO release (FBF+<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28229">L-NMMA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">Acetylcholine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi> (SNP) were administered to assess endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared with controls, diabetic subjects had significantly lower vasodilatory responses to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> and SNP (p&lt;0.05 for each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Basal FBF and FBF+<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28229">L-NMMA</z:chebi> were increased in diabetic subjects compared with controls (2.4+/-0.2 ml/100ml/min versus 1.7+/-0.2 ml/100ml/min, p=0.02 and 1.9+/-0.1 ml/100ml/min versus 1.2+0.1 ml/100ml/min, p=0.01, respectively) whereas the change in FBF following <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28229">L-NMMA</z:chebi> was greater in the controls (-27% versus -19%, p=0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Amongst the diabetic subjects, pulse pressure and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> were independent predictors of FBF (b=0.04+/-0.01, adjusted r2=0.21 and p=0.001, and b=3.3+/-1.2, adjusted r2=0.12 and p=0.007, respectively) and FBF+<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28229">L-NMMA</z:chebi> (b=0.03+/-0.01, adjusted r2=0.20, p=0.002 and b=2.1+/-0.9, adjusted r2=0.09 and p=0.02, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Diastolic blood pressure predicted the change in FBF with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28229">L-NMMA</z:chebi> (b=-1.02+/-0.32, adjusted r2=0.20 and p=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that well controlled T2DM patients have impaired <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>-mediated vasodilatation of the forearm resistance arteries that is associated with impaired basal release of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> but an increase in the release of non-NO <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilators</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The latter may be a compensatory response to increased arterial stiffness and may be facilitated by an effect of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
