<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A number of studies have demonstrated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in the skeletal muscle plays a pivotal role in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A decrease in GLUT4 translocation from the intracellular pool to the plasma membranes in skeletal muscles has been implicated as a possible cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Herein, we examined the effects of an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">insulin-sensitizing drug</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> (TGZ), on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake and the translocation of GLUT4 in L6 myotubes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prolonged exposure (24 h) of L6 myotubes to TGZ (10(-5) mol/l) caused a substantial increase in the 2-deoxy-[3H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4167">D-glucose</z:chebi> (2-DG) uptake without changing the total amount of the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transporters GLUT4, GLUT1, and GLUT3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The TGZ-induced 2-DG uptake was completely abolished by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23528">cytochalasin</z:chebi>-B (10 micromol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ability of TGZ to translocate GLUT4 from light microsomes to the crude plasma membranes was greater than that of insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27641">cycloheximide</z:chebi> treatment (3.5 x 10(-6) mol/l) and the removal of TGZ by washing reversed the 2-DG uptake to the basal level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, insulin did not enhance the TGZ-induced 2-DG uptake additively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The TGZ-induced 2-DG uptake was only partially reversed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52289">wortmannin</z:chebi> to 80%, and TGZ did not change the expression and the phosphorylation of protein kinase B; the expression of protein kinase C (PKC)-lambda, PKC-beta2, and PKC-zeta; or 5'<z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>a-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="27013">Tocopherol</z:chebi>, which has a molecular structure similar to that of TGZ, did not increase 2-DG uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transport in L6 myotubes exposed to TGZ for 24 h is the result of an increased translocation of GLUT4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The present results imply that the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> on GLUT4 translocation may include a new mechanism for improving <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transport in skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
