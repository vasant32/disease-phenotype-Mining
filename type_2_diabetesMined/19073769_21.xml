<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined rs17782313, rs17700633, rs12970134, rs477181, rs502933, and rs4450508 near MC4R for association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-related quantitative traits, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Danish individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The variants were investigated for association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-related quantitative traits in 5,807 population-based sampled individuals, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in 14,940 individuals, and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in 8,821 individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The minor risk alleles of rs17782313, rs17700633, and rs12970134 were associated with BMI (effect per allele 0.25 kg/m2, P = 0.01; 0.23, P = 0.01; and 0.31, P = 7 x 10(-4), respectively), waist circumference (0.67 cm, P = 0.006; 0.53, P = 0.02; and 0.85, P = 3 x 10(-4)), and body weight (1.04 kg, P = 6 x 10(-4); 0.71, P = 0.01; and 1.16, P = 8 x 10(-5)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In case-control studies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> defined by BMI, the minor C-allele of rs17782313 was associated with overweight/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (odds ratio [OR] 1.09, P = 0.006 and OR 1.12, P = 0.003, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the minor A-allele of rs17700633 was associated with overweight/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (1.12, P = 8 x 10(-5) and 1.16, P = 2 x 10(-5)), and the minor A-allele of rs12970134 was also associated with overweight/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (1.13, P = 2 x 10(-5) and 1.15, P = 6 x 10(-5)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>rs477181, rs502933, and rs4450508 were not significantly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in the Danish population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the minor risk alleles of rs17782313 and rs12970134 was higher among patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than among <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-tolerant individuals (OR 1.08, P = 0.08 and 1.08, P = 0.06, respectively); however, these borderline associations were abolished after adjustment for BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: rs17782313, rs17700633, and rs12970134 near MC4R associate with measures of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in Danish individuals </plain></SENT>
