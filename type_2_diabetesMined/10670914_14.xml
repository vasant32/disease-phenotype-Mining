<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study was carried out in two phases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In phase one, 6091 randomly selected subjects, 40 years or older, from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six districts of the valley were surveyed for prevalence of known <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In phase two, 5083 subjects, 40 years or older, were screened with oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test for prevalence of undiagnosed (asymptomatic) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities of carbohydrate intolerance were determined as recommended by WHO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of 6091 subjects interviewed, 115 were known cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> with an overall prevalence of 1.89% (1.98% in males and 1.77% in females) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test revealed that mean fasting as well as mean 2 h blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was significantly more in females as compared to males (4.68+/-0.91 and 6.40+/-2.12 vs. 4.49+/-0.96 and 5.94+/-2.03 mmol/l, respectively, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Subjects who had family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had a significantly higher prevalence of abnormal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GTT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of known <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> as well as that of abnormal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GTT</z:e> steadily increased with age, with a highest prevalence in the age group of &gt; or = 70 years (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>Obese</z:mp> subjects had a significantly higher basal as well as 2 h blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in males as well as in females </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Overall the prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> as well as IGT was significantly higher in the urban population </plain></SENT>
