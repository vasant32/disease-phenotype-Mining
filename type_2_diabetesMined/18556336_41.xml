<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Hepatic glucokinase (GCK) is a key regulator of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> storage and disposal in the liver, where its activity is competitively modulated, with respect to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, by binding to glucokinase regulatory protein (GCKR) in the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15946">fructose 6-phosphate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genome-wide association studies for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> identified GCKR as a potential locus for modulating <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated, in a general French population, the contribution of the GCKR rs1260326-P446L polymorphism to quantitative metabolic parameters and to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Genotype effects of rs1260326 were studied in 4,833 participants from the prospective DESIR (Data from an Epidemiological Study on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin Resistance</z:hpo> syndrome) cohort both at inclusion and using the measurements at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The minor T-allele of rs1260326 was strongly associated with lower fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (-1.43% per T-allele; P = 8 x 10(-13)) and fasting insulin levels (-4.23%; P = 3 x 10(-7)), lower homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> index (-5.69%; P = 1 x 10(-8)), and, conversely, higher <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels (3.41%; P = 1 x 10(-4)) during the 9-year study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These effects relate to a lower risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> (odds ratio [OR] 0.79 [95% CI 0.70-0.88]; P = 4 x 10(-5)) and of incident cases during the study (hazard ratio [HR] 0.83 [0.74-0.95]; P = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, an additive effect of GCKR rs1260326(T) and GCK (-30G) alleles conferred lower fasting glycemia (P = 1 x 10(-13)), insulinemia (P = 5 x 10(-6)), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> risk (P = 1 x 10(-6)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: GCKR-L446 carriers are protected against type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> despite higher <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels and risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e>, which suggests a potential molecular mechanism by which these two components of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> can be dissociated </plain></SENT>
