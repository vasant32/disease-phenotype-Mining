<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To test whether the genetic variant CCR5Delta32 in the CC-chemokine receptor 5, which is known to lead to CCR5 deficiency, is associated with mortality in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined the effect of presence or absence of the CCR5Delta32 on overall and cardiovascular mortality risk in the Zwolle Outpatient <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> project Integrating Available Care (ZODIAC) cohort, a type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patient cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We studied 756 patients with a mean duration of follow-up of 5.4 (+/- 1.4) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>194 patients died during follow up of which 83 were cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>144 subjects (19%) carried the CCR5Delta32 deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CCR5Delta32 carriers had an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.62 (95%CI: 0.40-0.96; p=0.03) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality and 0.63 (95%CI: 0.33-1.19; p=0.16) for cardiovascular mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The presence of CCR5Delta32 is associated with better survival in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that it is worthwhile to explore the protective potential of pharmacological blockade of CCR5 in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
