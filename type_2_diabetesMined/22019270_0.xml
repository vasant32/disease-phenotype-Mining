<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> (ACCORD) trial was a multicenter double 2 by 2 factorial randomized controlled trial of 10,251 middle-aged and older people who had type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, a GHbA1c of 7.5% or greater, and evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Biomarkers were assessed in a subset of 562 participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intervention effects on high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were tested using linear regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significantly lower average hs-CRP was noted in the intensive versus the standard glycemic group (p=0.029) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adjusting for change in BMI or waist circumference resulted in larger differences in adjusted hs-CRP (p&lt;0.001 and p&lt;0.002, respectively) between the glycemic intervention groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intensive glycemic control was associated with a reduction in hs-CRP in this study population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intervention associated increases in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> suppressed the beneficial effect of intensive glycemic control on lowering hs-CRP </plain></SENT>
