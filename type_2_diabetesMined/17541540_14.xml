<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials comparing dietary or non-dietary intake of n-3 PUFA with placebo in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by searching databases from 1966 to December 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Changes in the following variables were recorded triacylglycerol; total cholesterol; <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi> and their subfractions; <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> ratios; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoproteins</z:chebi>; and cholesterol particle sizes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 23 trials on non-dietary supplementation, involving 1,075 subjects with a mean treatment duration of 8.9 weeks, with sufficient data to permit pooling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with placebo, n-3 PUFA had a statistically significant effect on four outcomes, reducing levels of (1) triacylglycerol (18 trials, 969 subjects) by 25% (mean 0.45 mmol/l; 95% CI -0.58 to -0.32; p &lt; 0.00001); (2) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47773">VLDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> (7 trials, 238 subjects) by 36% (0.07 mmol/l; 95% CI -0.13 to 0.00; p = 0.04); and (3) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47776">VLDL-triacylglycerol</z:chebi> (6 trials, 178 subjects) by 39.7% (0.44 mmol/l; 95% CI -0.83 to -0.05; p = 0.03); while slightly increasing <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> (16 trials, 565 subjects) by 5.7% (0.11 mmol/l; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.22; p = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no significant effects on total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoproteins</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> subfractions or ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In addition to recognised triacylglycerol-lowering effects, n-3 PUFA supplementation decreases <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47773">VLDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47776">VLDL-triacylglycerol</z:chebi>, but may have an adverse effect on <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Larger and longer term clinical trials are required to conclusively establish the effect of n-3 PUFA on cardiovascular risk markers and outcomes in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
