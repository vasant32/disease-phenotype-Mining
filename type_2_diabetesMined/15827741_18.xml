<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Study cohorts included 51,735 Finnish men and women aged 25-74 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Smoking status and the history of MI and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were recorded, and height, weight, blood pressure and serum cholesterol levels were measured at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additional data on the occurrence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and MI prior to baseline survey were obtained from national hospital discharge and drug registers through computerised register linkage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mortality data were obtained from the national mortality register </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During a mean follow-up period of 17.2 years, 9,201 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hazard ratios (HRs) for coronary mortality were 2.1, 4.0 and 6.4 among men with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> alone, men with MI alone, and men with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and MI, respectively, compared with men with neither <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> nor a history of MI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The corresponding HRs among women were 4.9, 2.5 and 9.4, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The equivalent HRs for cardiovascular and total mortality were 2.2, 3.3 and 6.0, and 1.8, 2.3 and 3.7 in men, and 4.4, 2.4 and 6.5, and 3.2, 1.7 and 4.4 in women, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Diabetic men and women had similar total mortality rates, whereas total mortality rates were markedly higher among men in the other three <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-MI categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> and MI markedly increase cardiovascular and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In women, the association between <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and mortality was stronger than that between MI and mortality, whereas the converse was true among men </plain></SENT>
