<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eligible Asian Indian subjects, n=212, had anthropometric and blood pressure measurements, followed by an OGTT, HbA1c, serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> tests and EZSCAN measurement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Biochemically, 24 subjects were diagnosed with DM, 30 with IGT, 57 subjects had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (NGT) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> (MS) and 101 had NGT without MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) and HbA1c levels were highest in the DM group (p&lt;0.0001 for both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> levels were different (p=0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FPG at a cut-off level of 7.0 mmol/L had a low sensitivity to detect DM (29%) EZSCAN had a 75% sensitivity to detect DM, 70% for IGT and 84% for NGT with MS at threshold &gt;50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: FPG had low sensitivity to detect DM in the study group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>EZSCAN demonstrated good sensitivity to detect IGT and DM and also identified NGT with MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The concept of measuring ion fluxes through the skin appears to be a powerful method for early detection of MS, IGT and DM </plain></SENT>
