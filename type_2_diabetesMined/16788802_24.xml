<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the yearly incidence for this country during 1992-1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Data obtained by telephone interviews of 93,484 diagnosed diabetic patients enrolled in Taiwan's National Health Insurance programme formed the basis of this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 36,153 incident cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (17,097 men and 19,056 women) were identified and incidence rates calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The trends of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and parental <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall 5-year incidences for men and women were 187.1 and 218.4 per 100,000 population, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The trends from 1992-1996 were increased for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> age groups in men and for most age groups in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A 2.8-fold increase in incidence was observed for the youngest age group (&lt;35 years), in which the increase in incidence was higher than in the older age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Men showed a higher fold increase in incidence than did women (3.5 vs 2.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> at interview increased from 39.2% in 1992 to 47.6% in 1996 (p&lt;0.001) and was significant for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Parental <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> showed no yearly change when <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were analysed together, but there was a trend towards a decrease in the youngest age group (&lt;35 years) and a trend towards an increase in the oldest age groups (&gt;/=55 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: An increasing incidence of diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was observed for each sex in most age groups in Taiwan, but was most marked in the youngest age group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A parallel increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> was observed with the increasing incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
