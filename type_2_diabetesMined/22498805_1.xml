<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: There is now growing evidence that <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> (Mg) deficiency is implicated in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and its complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it has not been fully elucidated whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0002917'>hypomagnesemia</z:hpo> is a predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e>) in type 2 diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 455 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> (CKD) patients (144 with type 2 diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> and 311 with nondiabetic CKD) who were hospitalized at Osaka General Medical Center for a CKD educational program between April 2001 and December 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was progression to renal replacement therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Participants were categorized based on serum Mg level into Low-Mg (serum Mg level â‰¤1.8 mg/dL) and High-Mg (serum Mg level &gt;1.8 mg/dL) groups with the previously published <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lower limit chosen as the cutoff point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the subjects with type 2 diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, 102 progressed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e> during follow-up (median, 23 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A multivariate Cox proportional hazards model showed that after adjustment for various demographic factors and laboratory data, the Low-Mg group had a 2.12-fold higher risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e> than the High-Mg group (95% CI 1.28-3.51; P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, 135 of the nondiabetic CKD subjects progressed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e> during follow-up (median, 44 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant difference in outcome was found between the Low- and High-Mg groups of this population (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.15; 95% CI 0.70-1.90; P = 0.57) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002917'>Hypomagnesemia</z:hpo> is a novel predictor of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e> in patients with type 2 diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
