<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, there is a decreased responsiveness of the pancreas to GIP; however, the insulin response to GLP-1 remains intact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The literature suggests that the ineffectiveness of GIP in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may be a result of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> homologous desensitization of the GIP receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Yet, there has been no conclusive evidence suggesting that GIP levels are elevated in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The hypothesis of the present study is that one cause of decreased responsiveness to GIP in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is an inappropriate expression of the GIP receptor in the pancreatic islet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis was tested using a strain of diabetic fatty <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> rats displayed basal GIP levels similar to the control animals; however, they were unresponsive to a GIP infusion (4 pmol.min(-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>kg(-1)), whereas the lean animals displayed a significant reduction in blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (GIP levels, 50% control after 60 min, P &lt; 0.05) as well as a significant increase in circulating insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>GIP also potently stimulated first-phase insulin secretion from isolated perifused islets (10.3 +/- 3.0 x basal), and GIP and GLP-1 potentiated insulin secretion from the perfused pancreas (6 x control area under the curve [AUC]) from lean animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>GIP yielded no significant effect in the Vancouver diabetic fatty <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> (VDF) rat pancreases, whereas GLP-1 elicited an eightfold increase of insulin secretion from the perfused VDF pancreas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Islets from lean animals subjected to static incubations with GIP showed a 2.2-fold increase in cAMP, whereas GIP failed to increase islet cAMP in the VDF islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Finally, the expression of both GIP receptor <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein was decreased in islets from VDF rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the decreased effectiveness of GIP in the VDF rat and in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may be a result of a decreased receptor expression in the islet </plain></SENT>
