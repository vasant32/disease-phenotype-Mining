<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male OLETF and littermate Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) (28 weeks old) rats were separated as follows: LETO w/wo <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2781">apocynin</z:chebi> (Gp C, Gp C-apo), OLETF w/wo <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2781">apocynin</z:chebi> (Gp DM, Gp DM-apo) and OLETF plus l-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="29785">nitro</z:chebi> arginine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47622">acetate ester</z:chebi> w/wo <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2781">apocynin</z:chebi> (Gp DMLN, Gp DMLN-apo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five days after, peritoneal macrophages were stimulated with thioglycolate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two days after, they were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">Acetylcholine</z:chebi>-induced nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi>-dependent (NO-dependent) relaxation and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28787">nitroglycerin</z:chebi>-induced NO-independent relaxation were improved in the Gp DMLN-apo, compared with that in Gp DMLN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Tone-related basal NO release and plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29272">NO(2) </z:chebi>(-) and NO(3) (-) tended to be lower in Gp DM and Gp DMLN groups </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intimal thickening was observed in aortae of Gp DM and Gp DMLN animals; however, there was little in aortae of Gp DM-apo and Gp DMLN(-) apo rats </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2781">Apocynin</z:chebi> restores the impairment of endothelial and non-endothelial function in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011875" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic angiopathy</z:e> in OLETF without changing plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
