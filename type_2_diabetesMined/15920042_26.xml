<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Post hoc analysis of long-term effects of different amounts of <z:mp ids='MP_0004889'>increased energy expenditure</z:mp> (metabolic equivalents [METS] per hour per week) through voluntary aerobic physical activity was performed in 179 type 2 diabetic subjects (age 62 +/- 1 years [mean +/- SE]) randomized to a physical activity counseling intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects were followed for 2 years and divided into six groups based on their increments in METs per hour per week: group 0 (no activity, n = 28), group 1-10 (6.8 +/- 0.3, n = 27), group 11-20 (17.1 +/- 0.4, n = 31), group 21-30 (27.0 +/- 0.5, n = 27), group 31-40 (37.5 +/- 0.5, n = 32), and group &gt;40 (58.3 +/- 1.8, n = 34) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, the six groups did not differ for energy expenditure, age, sex, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> parameters measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 2 years, in group 0 and in group 1-10, no parameter changed; in groups 11-20, 21-30, 31-40, and &gt;40, HbA(1c), blood pressure, total serum cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, and estimated percent of 10-year <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> risk improved (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In group 21-30, 31-40, and &gt;40, body weight, waist circumference, heart rate, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, serum <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> also improved (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METs per hour per week correlated positively with changes of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> and negatively with those of other parameters (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 2 years, per capita yearly costs of medications increased (P = 0.008) by USD393 in group 0, did not significantly change in group 1-10 (USD 206, P = 0.09), and decreased in group 11-20 (USD -196, P = 0.01), group 21-30 (USD -593, P = 0.009), group 31-40 (USD -660, P = 0.003), and group &gt;40 (USD -579, P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
