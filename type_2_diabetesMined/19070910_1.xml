<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to investigate whether variants in PCK1 gene, located in this region, was associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in eastern China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eleven SNPs were identified by sequencing in PCK1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The G (Val184) allele of rs707555 (Leu184Val) in diabetic group was associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P=0.015; odds ratio 1.42 [95% CI 1.08-1.88]), and was much stronger in subgroup with the BMI&lt;23kg/m(2) (P=0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>rs2070755, located in intron 4, was also associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P=0.037; odds ratio 1.29 [95% CI 1.03-1.64]), especially in subgroup with the BMI&lt;23 kg/m(2) (P=0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The enzymatic activity of PEPCK-C containing Leu184 was higher than that of PEPCK-C containing Val184 (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results showed that Val184 of PCK1 gene might increase the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in eastern Chinese population with BMI&lt;23 kg/m(2) via reducing the PEPCK-C activity </plain></SENT>
