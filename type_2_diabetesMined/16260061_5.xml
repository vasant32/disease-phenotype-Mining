<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and its risk factors in a population of indigenous Australians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 332 indigenous community residents aged 15 years and over with fasting blood samples and anthropometric measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Almost half of the study population (47.3%) was extremely lean (BMI&lt;22 kg/m(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Leanness was particularly pronounced in the youngest age group (15&lt;20 years), 78% of which had a BMI&lt;22 kg/m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 12% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was highest in those 45-54 years and declined in older aged people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were detected in those aged less than 30 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> prevalence was strongly linked to BMI and age (age-adjusted odds ratio=24.1, 95% CI 6.0-96.5, p&lt;0.001) for BMI&gt;or=25 kg/m(2) versus BMI&lt;22 kg/m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Those with the lowest <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk profile are lean (BMI&lt;22 kg/m(2)) and/or young (age 15-34 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight that strategies to prevent or delay the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> should focus on the maintenance of leanness from adolescence and throughout adult life whilst young people are still in the process of forming lifelong habits </plain></SENT>
