<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This is a case-control study of 82 type 2 diabetic and 82 age- and sex-matched nondiabetic subjects from the Chennai Urban Rural Epidemiology Study, an ongoing epidemiological study in southern India </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Visceral, subcutaneous, and total abdominal fat were measured using CT, while DEXA was used to measure central abdominal and total body fat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anthropometric measures included BMI, waist circumference, sagittal abdominal diameter (SAD), and waist-to-hip ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Visceral and central abdominal fat showed a strong correlation with each other (P &lt;0.0001), and kappa analysis revealed a fairly good agreement between tertiles of visceral and central abdominal fat (kappa=0.44, P &lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diabetic subjects had significantly higher visceral (P=0.005) and central abdominal (P=0.011) fat compared with nondiabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Waist circumference and SAD showed a strong correlation with visceral (P &lt;0.01) and central abdominal (P &lt;0.0001) fat in both diabetic and nondiabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis revealed visceral (odds ratio [OR] 1.011, P=0.004) and central abdominal (OR 1.001, P=0.013) fat to be associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, even after adjusting for age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Visceral and central abdominal fat showed a strong association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both measures correlated well with each other and with waist circumference and SAD in diabetic and nondiabetic urban Asian Indians </plain></SENT>
