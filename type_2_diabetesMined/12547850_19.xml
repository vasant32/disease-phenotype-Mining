<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 17 elderly patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> received 12 weeks of treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Homeostasis assessment model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-IR), homeostasis assessment model of beta-cell function, HbA(1c), C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> in 24-h pooled urine (urine CPR), and plasma concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34505">8-epi-PGF2alpha</z:chebi>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1, and adiponectin were measured at various times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The metabolic clearance rate of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (MCR-g) was also assessed by a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 8 weeks of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> treatment, significant reductions were observed in HbA(1c) (from 8.4 +/- 1.9 to 6.9 +/- 1.0%), HOMA-IR (from 2.54 +/- 2.25 to 1.69 +/- 0.95%), and plasma TNF-alpha concentrations (from 4.0 +/- 2.0 to 2.6 +/- 2.5 pg/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MCR-g was significantly increased from 3.92 +/- 1.09 to 5.73 +/- 1.47 mg </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Plasma adiponectin increased from 6.61 +/- 3.06 to 10.2 +/- 7.14 micro g/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In control subjects, who maintained conventional treatment, no significant changes were observed in any of these markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">Glimepiride</z:chebi> remarkably improved <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, suggested by a significant reduction in HOMA-IR, an increase in MCR-g, and a reduction in HbA(1c) without changing extrapancreatic beta-cell function and urine CPR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Increased plasma adiponectin and decreased plasma TNF-alpha may underlie the improvement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
