<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To assess whether variants of this gene contribute to the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in Caucasians, we genotyped 413 nondiabetic individuals for two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at this locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The two SNPs (45T--&gt;G and 276G--&gt;T) were chosen because of their association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Japanese </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Whereas each polymorphism was significantly associated with some correlate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, the haplotype defined by the two together was strongly associated with many components of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Homozygotes for the risk haplotype had higher body weight (P = 0.03), waist circumference (P = 0.004), systolic (P = 0.01) and diastolic (P = 0.003) blood pressure, fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (P = 0.02) and insulin (P = 0.005) levels, homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (P = 0.003), and total to <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> ratio (P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Homozygotes also had significantly lower plasma levels of adiponectin (P = 0.03), independent of sex, age, and body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In an independent study group of 614 Caucasians, including 310 with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the risk haplotype was confirmed to be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004324'>increased body weight</z:hpo> (P = 0.03) but not with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> per se </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that variability at the adiponectin locus is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and other features of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> syndrome, but given the nature of the two SNPs, the risk haplotype is most probably a marker in linkage disequilibrium with an as yet unidentified polymorphism that affects plasma adiponectin levels and insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
