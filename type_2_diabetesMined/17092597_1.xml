<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to examine whether the restoration of a more physiological insulin profile using rapid-acting insulin analogues might, through effects on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> toxicity, improve endogenous insulin secretion rate (ISR) and secondly improve markers of vascular risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eighteen people with insulin-treated Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were recruited into a single centre, cross-over, open-labeled study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The order of pre-meal unmodified human insulin or insulin aspart was randomized: treatment periods lasted at least 8-12 weeks after which ISR was assessed by stepped low-dose <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion and fasting markers of vascular risk measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> control was good (HbA(1c) 6.94+/-0.12 (+/-S.E.)% versus 7.07+/-0.13%, NS) with insulin aspart and human insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean post-prandial self-monitored blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration was also good particularly with insulin aspart (7.5+/-0.41 mmol/l versus 8.19+/-0.34 mmol/l) but the difference did not reach statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Over 160 min ISR did not differ between insulin aspart and human insulin and there was also no change in various markers of vascular risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion a meal-time+basal insulin regimen gave close to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> post-prandial blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control with both the insulin aspart and human insulin regimens, such that no difference in ISR or markers of vascular risk could be demonstrated </plain></SENT>
