<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of compliance with treatment (medication and clinic appointments) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality in people with insulin-treated type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data were extracted from U.K. general practice records and included patients (N = 15,984) who had diagnostic codes indicative of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or who had received a prescription for an oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> agent and were treated with insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Records in the 30 months before the index date were inspected for clinical codes (recorded at consultation) indicating medication noncompliance or medical appointment nonattendance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Noncompliance was defined as missing more than one scheduled visit or having at least one provider code for not taking medications as prescribed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Relative survival postindex date was compared by determining progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality using Cox proportional hazards models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Those identified as clinic nonattenders were more likely to be smokers, younger, have higher HbA(1c), and have more prior primary care contacts and greater morbidity (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Those identified as medication noncompliers were more likely to be women (P = 0.001), smokers (P = 0.014), and have higher HbA(1c), more prior primary care contacts, and greater morbidity (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for confounding factors, medication noncompliance (hazard ratio 1.579 [95% CI 1.167-2.135]), clinic nonattendance of one or two missed appointments (1.163 [1.042-1.299]), and clinic nonattendance of greater than two missed appointments (1.605 [1.356-1.900]) were independent risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Medication noncompliance and clinic nonattendance, assessed during routine care by primary care physicians or their staff, were independently associated with increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> receiving insulin </plain></SENT>
