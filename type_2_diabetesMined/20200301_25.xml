<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this 24-week trial, 973 insulin-naive type 2 diabetic patients on stable oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering drugs with A1C 7.0-10.5% were randomized to glargine once daily or detemir twice daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Insulin doses were systematically titrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS 27.5 and 25.6% of patients reached the primary outcome with glargine and detemir, respectively, demonstrating the noninferiority of glargine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Improvements in A1C were -1.46 +/- 1.09% for glargine and -1.54 +/- 1.11% for detemir (P = 0.149), with similar proportions of patients achieving A1C &lt;7% (P = 0.254) but more detemir-treated patients reaching A1C &lt;6.5% (P = 0.017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>Hypoglycemia</z:hpo> risk was similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>Weight gain</z:mp> was higher for glargine (difference: 0.77 kg, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Glargine doses were lower than detemir doses: 43.5 +/- 29.0 vs. 76.5 +/- 50.5 units/day (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In insulin-naive type 2 diabetic patients, glargine reached similar control as detemir, with more <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>, but required significantly lower doses </plain></SENT>
