<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Seven <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> men with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (OBDM) and seven healthy young men (HY) participated in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion rate (GIR) was determined by <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> clamp procedure at an insulin infusion rate of 40 mU m-2 min-1 (plasma insulin concentrations: 700-800 pmol l-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Confirming stabilized GIR, a 30-min bicycle exercise was performed during the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> clamp which was continued for 120 min after exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Average GIR in OBDM for last 30 min prior to exercise were significantly lower than HY (28.3 +/- 1.7, 47.4 +/- 1.8 mumol kg-1 min-1 respectively, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>GIR abruptly increased during exercise and gradually decreased after exercise to the nadir almost at the time from 30 to 60 min in recovery period in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>GIR in OBDM, however, gradually increased significantly over pre-exercise levels (P &lt; 0.05), following exercise and reached the same levels compared to HY after 80 min of recovery period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results indicated that in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 30 min of low intensity bicycle exercise significantly enhances the lower level of insulin-induced <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake shortly after exercise and might be useful for the treatment of post-prandial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
