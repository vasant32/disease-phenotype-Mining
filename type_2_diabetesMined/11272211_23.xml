<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report the molecular genetic and clinical characteristics of these patients including 29 new families and 8 novel HNF-1alpha gene mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the transactivation domain are more likely to be protein truncating rather than result in amino acid substitutions, suggesting that a relatively severe disruption of this domain is necessary to result in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
