<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> on BNP levels in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> that are often associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and a higher risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Plasma BNP levels, BMI, and cardiac function parameters were measured in 608 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A computed tomography scan was performed to measure abdominal fat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In multivariable regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, systolic blood pressure, pulse rate, serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, asynergy, left atrial dimension, percent fractional shortening, and left ventricular mass, there was an inverse relationship between BMI and BNP (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>Obese</z:mp> individuals with 25&lt;/=BMI&lt;30 and 30&lt;/=BMI individuals were more likely to have lower BNP levels compared with BMI&lt;22 individuals (multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (95% CIs): 1.61 (1.16-2.26) and 2.07 (1.35-3.22), respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inverse associations were noted between BNP and visceral fat area (VFA) in both sexes (p=0.029 for men, p=0.024 for women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, BNP levels are significantly lower in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects after multivariable adjustments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among various <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> parameters, visceral fat was most closely associated with BNP levels </plain></SENT>
