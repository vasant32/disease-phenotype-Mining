<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this 26-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 390 patients were randomized to receive alogliptin 12.5 mg (n = 131), alogliptin 25 mg (n = 129) or placebo (n = 130) once daily, as add-on to stable insulin therapy with or without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was change in <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1C) (HbA(1C)) at week 26 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At week 26, mean HbA(1C) changes from the mean baseline value of 9.3% were significantly greater for alogliptin 12.5 mg (-0.63 +/- 0.08%) and alogliptin 25 mg (-0.71 +/- 0.08%) than placebo (-0.13 +/- 0.08%; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significantly greater proportions of patients receiving alogliptin 12.5 or 25 mg than placebo had HbA(1C) decreases of &gt; or =0.5, &gt; or =1.0 and &gt; or =1.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Insulin doses remained unchanged, and there were no differences in the proportions of patients experiencing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> among placebo (24%), alogliptin 12.5 mg (27%) and alogliptin 25 mg (27%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean weight increases from baseline at week 26 were similar for placebo (0.6 +/- 0.2 kg), alogliptin 12.5 mg (0.7 +/- 0.2 kg) and alogliptin 25 mg (0.6 +/- 0.2 kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Incidences of overall adverse events, and of gastrointestinal, dermatological and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>-related events, were similar among groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Adding alogliptin to previous insulin therapy (with or without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>) significantly improved glycaemic control in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> inadequately controlled on insulin, without causing <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> or increasing the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further studies are warranted to explore the role of alogliptin added to optimized basal insulin regimens </plain></SENT>
