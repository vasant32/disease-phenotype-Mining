<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently it was reported that glucokinase (GK) expression was increased by TZDs in the liver of diabetic ZDF rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanism whereby TZDs increase GK expression is not yet studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have assumed that liver type glucokinase (LGK) induction by TZDs could be achieved by direct transcriptional activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, we have dissected the LGK promoter to explore the presence of a PPAR response element (PPRE) in the promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>From this study, we were able to localize a PPRE in the -116/-104 region of the rat LGK gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The PPAR-gamma/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26537">retinoid</z:chebi> X receptor-alpha heterodimer was bound to the element and activated the LGK promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The LGK promoter lacking the PPRE or having mutations in the PPRE could not be activated by PPAR-gamma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> increased endogenous GK <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in primary hepatocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that PPAR-gamma can directly activate GK expression in liver and may contribute to improving <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
