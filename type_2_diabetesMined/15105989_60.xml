<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine for the first time whether skeletal muscle AdipoR1 and/or AdipoR2 gene expression levels are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using RT-PCR and northern analysis we measured AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 gene expression in skeletal muscle from healthy Mexican Americans with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance who had (n=8) or did not have (n=10) a family history of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Gene expression profiling indicated that the AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 isoforms are highly expressed in human skeletal muscle, unlike in mice where AdipoR2 expression was highest in the liver, and AdipoR1 was highest in skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the study subjects, the expression levels of AdipoR1 (p=0.004) and AdipoR2 (p=0.04), as well as plasma adiponectin concentration (p=0.03) were lower in people with a family history of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than in those with no family history of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Importantly, the expression levels of both receptors correlated positively with insulin sensitivity (r=0.64, p=0.004 and r=0.47, p=0.048 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Collectively, these data indicate that both isoforms of the adiponectin receptor play a role in the insulin-sensitising effect of adiponectin </plain></SENT>
