<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the hypothesis that CD36, a scavenger receptor and fatty acid translocase, is upregulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) among patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and is a biomarker of PBMC activation and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used a cross-sectional observational design to study a multi-racial/ethnic population sample consisting of Caucasians, Hispanics, and Native Americans with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 33) and nondiabetic control subjects (n = 27) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PBMC CD36 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>/protein and plasma high sensitivity (hs) C-reactive protein (hsCRP), hs-interleukin-6 (hsIL-6), and adiponectin were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Unadjusted PBMC CD36 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein were 1.56- and 1.63-fold higher, respectively, among type 2 diabetic subjects versus control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PBMC CD36 protein was directly associated with CD36 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, plasma hsCRP, and hsIL-6 and inversely associated with plasma adiponectin in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Increased CD36 expression is a biomarker of PBMC activation and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and may become a useful tool in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> risk stratification </plain></SENT>
