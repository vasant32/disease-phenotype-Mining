<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This project sought to examine the relation between egg intake and the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in two large prospective cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this prospective study, we used data from two completed randomized trials: 20,703 men from the Physicians' Health Study I (1982-2007) and 36,295 women from the Women's Health Study (1992-2007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Egg consumption was ascertained using questionnaires, and we used the Cox proportional hazard model to estimate relative risks of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During mean follow-up of 20.0 years in men and 11.7 years in women, 1,921 men and 2,112 women developed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with no egg consumption, multivariable adjusted hazard ratios for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were 1.09 (95% CI 0.87-1.37), 1.09 (0.88-1.34), 1.18 (0.95-1.45), 1.46 (1.14-1.86), and 1.58 (1.25-2.01) for consumption of &lt;1, 1, 2-4, 5-6, and &gt; or =7 eggs/week, respectively, in men (P for trend &lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Corresponding multivariable hazard ratios for women were 1.06 (0.92-1.22), 0.97 (0.83-1.12), 1.19 (1.03-1.38), 1.18 (0.88-1.58), and 1.77 (1.28-2.43), respectively (P for trend &lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that high levels of egg consumption (daily) are associated with an increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Confirmation of these findings in other populations is warranted </plain></SENT>
