<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their utility and comparative performance in a contemporary group of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are not well established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of the Framingham and UK Prospective <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study (UKPDS) risk equations in participants who took part in the Action in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Vascular disease</z:e>: Preterax and Diamicron-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE) trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The 4-year risks of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) and its constituents were estimated using two published Framingham and the UKPDS risk equations in 7,502 individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> without prior known <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> at their enrolment in the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The risk of major <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> was overestimated by 170% (95% CI 146-195%) and 202% (176-231%) using the two Framingham equations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The risk of major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> was overestimated by 198% (162-238%) with the UKPDS, and by 146% (117-179%) and 289% (243-341%) with the two different Framingham equations, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The risks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> events were also overestimated with the UKPDS and one of the Framingham equations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ability of these equations to rank risk among ADVANCE participants was modest, with c-statistics ranging from 0.57 to 0.71 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results stratified by sex, treatment allocation and ethnicity were broadly similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Application of the Framingham and UKPDS risk equations to a contemporary treated group of patients with established type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is likely to substantially overestimate cardiovascular risk </plain></SENT>
