<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relationship between resistance to the glucoregulatory actions of insulin and its effects on the vasculature (in particular NO-dependent responses) is poorly characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied this relationship in mice heterozygous for knockout of the insulin receptor (IRKO), which have a mild perturbation of insulin signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Male heterozygous IRKO mice aged 8-12 weeks were compared with age- and sex-matched littermates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IRKO mice had fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, free fatty acid, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels similar to those of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intraperitoneal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin tolerance tests were also similar in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Insulin levels in response to a <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> load were approximately twofold higher in IRKO compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice (1.08 +/- 0.11 vs. 0.62 +/- 0.13 ng/ml; P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite this mild metabolic phenotype, IRKO mice had increased systolic blood pressure (124 +/- 4 vs. 110 +/- 3 mmHg; P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Basal NO bioactivity, assessed from the increase in tension of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi> preconstricted aortic rings in response to the NO synthase inhibitor N(G)-monomethyl-l-arginine, was reduced in IRKO (61 +/- 14 vs. 152 +/- 30%; P = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Insulin-mediated NO release in aorta, assessed as the reduction in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi> constrictor response after insulin preincubation, was lost in IRKO mice (5 +/- 8% change vs. 66 +/- 9% reduction in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp>; P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Insulin-stimulated aortic endothelial NO synthase phosphorylation was also significantly blunted in IRKO mice (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that insulin-stimulated NO responses in the vasculature are exquisitely sensitive to changes in insulin-signaling pathways in contrast to the glucoregulatory actions of insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings underscore the importance of early intervention in insulin-resistant states, where <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis may be <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> but substantial abnormalities of the vascular effects of insulin may already be present </plain></SENT>
