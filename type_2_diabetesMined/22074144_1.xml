<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An estimated 72.5 million American adults are <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, and the growing US <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> epidemic is responsible for substantial increase in morbidity and mortality, as well as increased health care costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> results from a combination of personal and societal factors, but is often viewed as a character flaw rather than a medical condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This leads to stigma and discrimination towards <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals and decreases the likelihood of effective intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conditions related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> are increasingly common, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e>, impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (IFG) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which indicate high risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This paper reviews the progression from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, identifying physiological changes that occur along this path as well as opportunities for patient identification and disease prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetes</z:e> (defined as having IFG, IGT or both) and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> require interventions designed to preserve insulin sensitivity and Î²-cell function, both of which start to deteriorate prior to T2DM diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lifestyle modification, including both healthy eating choices and increased physical activity, is essential for weight management and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> is often considered by patients and physicians as being impossible to achieve, effective interventions do exist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Specifically, the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Prevention Program (DPP) and programs modelled along its parameters have shown repeated successes, even with long-term maintenance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Recent setbacks in the development of medications for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> further stress the importance of lifestyle management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>By viewing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disorder</z:e> rather than a personal <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp>, we can work with patients to address this increasingly prevalent condition and improve long-term health outcomes </plain></SENT>
