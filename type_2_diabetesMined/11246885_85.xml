<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Evidence is accumulating that low levels of IGF-I play a role in the pathogenesis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the role of a genetic polymorphism in the promoter region of the IGF-I gene in relation to circulating IGF-I levels and growth measured as body height, and we studied the relationship of this polymorphism with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The relation between the IGF-I polymorphism and body height was assessed in a population-based sample of 900 subjects from the Rotterdam Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Within each genotype stratum, 50 subjects were randomly selected for a study of the relation of this polymorphism with serum IGF-I levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To assess the risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we studied 220 patients and 596 normoglycemic control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, 477 patients with evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> on electrocardiogram and 808 control subjects were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A 192-bp allele was present in 88% of the population, suggesting that this is the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> allele from which <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other alleles originated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Body height was, on average, 2.7 cm lower (95% CI for difference -4.6 to -0.8 cm, P = 0.004), and serum IGF-I concentrations were 18% lower (95% CI for difference -6.0 to -1.3 mmol/l, P = 0.003) in subjects who did not carry the 192-bp allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In noncarriers of the 192-bp allele, an increased relative risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (1.7 [95% CI 1.1-2.7]) and for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (1.7 [95% CI 1.1-2.5]) was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the relative risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> in subjects without the 192-bp allele was 3.4 (95% CI 1.1-11.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests that a genetically determined exposure to relatively low IGF-I levels is associated with an increased risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
