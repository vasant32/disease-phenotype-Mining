<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the higher prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Mexican-origin populations might be related, in part, not to Native American genetic admixture but to Spanish genetic admixture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Four population-based epidemiological surveys conducted with Mexican-origin and European-origin samples provided data relevant to this question </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four surveys, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was defined as fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &gt; or =7.0 mmol/l or 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &gt; or =11.1 mmol/l or use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A comparison of the two Mexican-origin populations showed that the age- and sex-adjusted prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was lower in Mexico than in SA-MA (15.1 vs. 17.9%, P = 0.032) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Between the two European-origin populations, the prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was lower in SA-NHW than in Spain (6.2 vs. 9.1%, P &lt; 0.0001), but differences were attenuated by adjustment for BMI or after stratification by education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In logistic regression analyses, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was associated with Mexican ethnic origin after adjusting for age, education, BMI, and waist-to-hip ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Spain was intermediate between that in Mexican-origin populations and SA-NHW </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although the higher degree of Native American admixture is a major contributor to the higher rates of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we cannot completely rule out a partial contribution of Spanish admixture to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility among Mexican- origin populations </plain></SENT>
