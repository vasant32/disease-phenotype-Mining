<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the association of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> particle size and concentration measured by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy with clinical type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a prospective study of 26,836 initially healthy women followed for 13 years for incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 1,687) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Baseline <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> were measured directly and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> size and concentration by NMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cox regression models included nonlipid risk factors (age, race, smoking, exercise, education, menopause, blood pressure, BMI, family history, A1C, and C-reactive protein) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>NMR <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> were also examined after further adjusting for standard <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was significantly associated with baseline <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, and NMR-measured size and concentration of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>, IDL, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi> particles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The associations of these particles differed substantially by size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Small <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>(NMR) and small <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>(NMR) were positively associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (quintile 5 vs. 1 [adjusted hazard ratios and 95% CIs], 4.04 [3.21-5.09] and 1.84 [1.54-2.19], respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By contrast, large <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>(NMR) and large <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>(NMR) were inversely associated (quintile 1 vs. 5, 2.50 [2.12-2.95] and 4.51 [3.68-5.52], respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>(NMR), large particles imparted higher risk than small particles (quintile 5 vs. 1, 3.11 [2.35-4.11] and 1.31 [1.10-1.55], respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">Lipoprotein</z:chebi> particle size remained significant after adjusting for standard <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and nonlipid factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective study of women, NMR <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> size and concentrations were associated with incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and remained significant after adjustment for established risk factors, including <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
