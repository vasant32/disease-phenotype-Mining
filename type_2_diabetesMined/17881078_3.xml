<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Simple yet reliable phenotypic markers are needed for early detection of the MS in Asian Indians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 126 subjects either with of without the MS were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anthropometric measurements (including assessment of novel phenotypic markers) and metabolic profile were done </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On univariate analysis, age more than 35 year, female gender, presence of buffalo hump and double chin and family history of T2DM were significantly associated with the MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> screening (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSS</z:e>) score (1.0 x double chin+1.2 x buffalo hump+1.3 x gender+1.4 x age category) was generated with a cutoff value of 3.5 out of total points of 4.9, with sensitivity and specificity 82% and 71% [area under the curve=0.83; 95% confidence Interval (0.76-0.90)], respectively in detecting individuals with the MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We describe buffalo hump and double chin as novel phenotypic markers for detection of MS for the first time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSS</z:e> score generated by us may be a useful tool for detection of MS in adult Asian Indians; however, it needs further validation in a larger sample of Asian Indians and in other ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
