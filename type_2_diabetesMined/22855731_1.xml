<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore associations between <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> etiology (type 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> [T1DM] vs. T2DM) and glycemic control in the prediction of 5-year periodontal status change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP) is a population-based stratified sample of German men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Healthy participants and those determined to have T2DM arose from the SHIP cohort, and T1DM participants were recruited from <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> clinics in the catchment area that gave rise to SHIP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dentate participants (n = 2,626; 53% women; 20-81 years of age) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> was determined via physician diagnosis and/or HbA(1c) ≥6.5% (uncontrolled <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> &gt;7.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Examiners blinded to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> status performed random half-mouth periodontal examinations, assessing probing depth (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>) and attachment loss (AL) (four sites/tooth) at baseline and follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Participants were categorized into six groups as follows: 1) <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> free (n = 2,280), 2) incident T2DM (n = 79), 3) controlled T2DM (n = 80), 4) uncontrolled T2DM (n = 72), 5) controlled T1DM (n = 43), and 6) uncontrolled T1DM (n = 72) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariable regressions, mean <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> change (Δ<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e>), mean AL change (ΔMAL), or incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0080233" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">tooth-loss</z:e> values were regressed across the aforementioned <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean (SD) Δ<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e> and ΔMAL values among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants were -0.08 ± 0.5 mm and 0.08 ± 1.03 mm, respectively, and 34% lost one or more teeth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Relative to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-free participants, those with uncontrolled T2DM experienced greater Δ<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e> ± SE (P &lt; 0.05), whereas participants with either uncontrolled T1DM or uncontrolled T2DM realized greater ΔMAL (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Uncontrolled T1DM and T2DM were both associated with an increased risk of future <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0080233" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">tooth loss</z:e> (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> control, but not etiology, was associated with future <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0080233" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">tooth loss</z:e> and accelerated AL progression </plain></SENT>
