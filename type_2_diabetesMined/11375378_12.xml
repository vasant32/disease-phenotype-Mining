<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The fetal insulin hypothesis proposed that a genetic predisposition to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> may also influence vascular development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, impaired vascular function may be an intrinsic abnormality in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low-birth weight</z:hpo> infants that antedates clinical features of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Two groups of 3-month-old term infants were included in the study: 17 infants of lowest quartile birth weight (LQBW) and 21 infants of highest quartile birth weight (HQBW) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three aspects of skin microvascular function were examined; response to local heating, response to <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> iontophoresis, and capillary density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median (interquartile ranges) birth weights of the LQBW and HQBW infants were 3,140 g (2,738-3,254) and 3,920 g (3,750-4,020), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Skin maximal hyperemic response to local heating was 2.14 V (1.68-2.30) in the LQBW group vs. 2.44 V (1.96-2.90) in the HQBW group (P = 0.020), and the endothelium-dependent vasodilatory response was 1.03 V (0.62-1.32) in the LQBW group vs. 0.78 V (0.45-1.32) in the HQBW group (P = 0.297) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Capillary density in the LQBW and HQBW groups were 46.3 mm(-2) (40.1-53.7) and 44.1 mm(-2) (41.7-56.0), respectively (P = 0.736) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Skin maximal hyperemic response was lower in LQBW infants, although no reduction in capillary density or defect in endothelium-dependent vasodilatation was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Such a lower maximal hyperemic response in early life in LQBW subjects who are at risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> supports the hypothesis that impaired microvascular function is an early antecedent to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in later life </plain></SENT>
