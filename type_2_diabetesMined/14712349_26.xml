<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We carried out a prospective study of dietary iron intake and incidence of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 35,698 postmenopausal women initially aged 55 to 69 years were followed for 11 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diet was assessed with a food frequency questionnaire at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Intake of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> iron showed a positive association with incident Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; the relative risks were 1.0, 1.07, 1.12, 1.14, and 1.28 across quintiles of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> iron (p trend =0.02) after adjustment for non-dietary and dietary risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">Heme</z:chebi> iron showed a weak positive association among non-drinkers, but the association appeared to be stronger among subjects who consumed more alcohol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For example, in a model restricted to those who drank alcohol at least 15 g/day, adjusted relative risks across quintiles of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> iron were 1.0, 2.26, 3.22, 1.92, and 4.42 (p trend =0.05); and consumers of 30 g/day of more of supplemental iron had an adjusted relative risk equal to 3.03 (95% CI, 1.29-7.12)], compared to those who took no iron supplement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Non-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> iron was inversely associated with incidence of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Amongst non-drinkers adjusted relative risks were 1.0, 0.83, 0.87, 0.72, and 0.67 across quintiles (p trend &lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This inverse association was lost among drinkers, in whom there was no association of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence with non-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> iron </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Greater dietary <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi>-iron intake and/or supplemental iron were associated with an increased risk of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, especially amongst those who drink alcohol </plain></SENT>
