<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed two cross-sectional studies of patients enrolled in randomized controlled trials of 1) an intensive blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control policy compared with a conventional blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control policy, and 2) a tight BP control policy compared with a less tight BP control policy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Also undertaken was a longitudinal study of patients in a randomized controlled trial of an intensive blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control policy compared with a conventional blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control policy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects' QOL was assessed before or at the time of randomization and from 6 months to 6 years after randomization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two cross-sectional samples of type 2 diabetic patients were randomized to therapies for blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control: 1) 2,431 patients, mean age 60, duration from randomization 8.0 years, completed a "specific" questionnaire covering four aspects of QOL, and 2) 3,104 patients, mean age 62, duration from randomization 11 years, completed a "generic" QOL measure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these samples, 628 and 747 patients, respectively, were also randomized to therapies for BP control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A sample of 122 non-diabetic control subjects, average age 62, were also given the specific questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A longitudinal sample of 374 type 2 diabetic patients randomized to either intensive or conventional blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> policies, mean age at randomization 52, were given the specific questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sample-sizes at 6 months and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 years after randomization were 322, 307, 280, 253, 225, 163, and 184, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The specific questionnaire assessed specific domains of QOL, including mood disturbance (Profile of Mood State), cognitive mistakes (Cognitive Failures Questionnaire), symptoms, and work satisfaction; the generic questionnaire (EQ5D) assessed general health </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both questionnaires were self-administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The cross-sectional studies showed that allocated therapies were neutral in effect, with neither improvement nor deterioration in QOL scores for mood, cognitive mistakes, symptoms, work satisfaction, or general health </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The longitudinal study also showed no difference in QOL scores for the specific domains assessed, other than showing marginally more symptoms in patients allocated to conventional than to intensive policy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the cross-sectional studies, patients who had had a macrovascular complication in the last year had worse general health, as measured by the generic questionnaire, than those without complications, with scale scores median 60 and 78 respectively (P = 0.0006) and tariff scores median 0.73 and 0.83 respectively (P = 0.0012); more problems with mobility, 64 and 36%, respectively (P &lt; 0.0001); and more problems with usual activities, 48 and 28% respectively (P = 0.0023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>As measured by the specific questionnaire, they also showed reduced vigor (P = 0.0077) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Patients who had had a microvascular complication in the last year reported more tension (P = 0.0082) and total mood disturbance (P = 0.0054), as measured by the specific questionnaire, than patients without complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Patients treated with insulin who had had two or more <z:hpo ids='HP_0001988'>hypoglycemic episodes</z:hpo> during the previous year reported more tension (P = 0.0023), more overall mood disturbance (P = 0.0009), and less work satisfaction (P = 0.0042), as measured by the specific questionnaire, than those with no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0745153" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycemic attacks</z:e>, after adjusting for age, duration from randomization, systolic BP, HbA1c, and sex in a multivariate polychotomous regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, complications of the disease affected QOL, whereas therapeutic policies shown to reduce the risk of complications had no effect on QOL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>It cannot be discerned whether frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001988'>hypoglycemic episodes</z:hpo> affect QOL, or whether patients with certain p </plain></SENT>
