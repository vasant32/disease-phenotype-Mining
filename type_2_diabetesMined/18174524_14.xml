<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To quantitate insulin sensitivity in lean and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> nondiabetic baboons and examine the underlying cellular/molecular mechanisms responsible for impaired insulin action to characterize a baboon model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty baboons received a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp with skeletal muscle and visceral adipose tissue biopsies at baseline and at 30 and 120 min after insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genes and protein expression of key molecules involved in the insulin signaling cascade (insulin receptor, insulin receptor substrate-1, p85, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Akt, and AS160) were sequenced, and insulin-mediated changes were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, baboons show a wide range of insulin sensitivity (6.2 +/- 4.8 mg x kg(-1) x min(-1)), and there is a strong inverse correlation between indexes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> and insulin sensitivity (r = -0.946, P &lt; 0.001 for % body fat; r = -0.72, P &lt; 0.001 for waist circumference) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The genes and protein sequences analyzed were found to have approximately 98% identity to those of man </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Insulin-mediated changes in key signaling molecules were impaired both in muscle and adipose tissue in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> insulin-resistant compared with lean insulin-sensitive baboons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> baboon is a pertinent nonhuman primate model to examine the underlying cellular/molecular mechanisms responsible for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and eventual development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
