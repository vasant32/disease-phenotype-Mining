<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A cohort of 486 middle-aged overweight men and women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> were followed for an average of 4.1 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The intervention and control groups were combined in the analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>LTPA was assessed by questionnaires, dietary intake by food records, and features of the MetS by anthropometric and biochemical measures annually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Resistance training sessions were documented for 137 participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Increased moderate-to-vigorous LTPA, even after adjustments for changes in dietary intakes of total and saturated fat, fiber, and energy, and change in BMI was associated with a greater likelihood for resolution (29.7 vs. 19.1%; P = 0.004 in the upper versus lower third of change) and a lesser likelihood for development (23.5 vs. 44.7%; P = 0.041) of the MetS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the components of the MetS, the increase in moderate-to-vigorous LTPA was associated most strongly with improvement of glycemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the 137 participants who participated in resistance training, MetS components were favorable in individuals who were in the upper third of participation rate (median 51 times/year) compared with individuals in the lowest third (median 8.5 times/year) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Increased moderate-to-vigorous LTPA was associated with a decreased likelihood of developing the MetS and an increased likelihood of its resolution in individuals at high risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
