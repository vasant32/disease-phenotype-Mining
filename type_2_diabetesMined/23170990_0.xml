<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial in 182 patients (74 from Korea and 108 from India) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After an initial 2 weeks of a diet and exercise programme followed by 2 weeks of a single-blind placebo run-in period, eligible patients were randomized to gemigliptin 50 mg or placebo, receiving the assigned treatment for 24 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HbA1c and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) were measured periodically, and oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test was performed at baseline and weeks 12 and 24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At week 24, gemigliptin treatment led to significant reductions in HbA1c measurements compared to placebo (adjust mean after subtracting the placebo effect size: -0.71%, 95% confidence interval: -1.04 to -0.37%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significantly greater proportion of patients achieved an HbA1c &lt;7% with gemigliptin than with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The placebo-subtracted FPG change from baseline at week 24 was -19.80 mg/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall incidence rates for adverse events were similar in the gemigliptin and placebo groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study showed the efficacy and safety of gemigliptin 50 mg administered once daily as a monotherapy for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
