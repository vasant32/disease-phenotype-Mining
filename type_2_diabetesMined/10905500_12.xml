<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we examined mutations in the NeuroD/BETA2 gene for association with either type 1 or 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three variants were identified in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>: Ala45Thr (allelic frequency 0.36, 95% CI 0.31-0.41), Pro197His (0.01), and Ser259Ser (0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ala45Thr and Pro197His were not associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but the transmission disequilibrium test showed unequal transmission of the A45 allele to offspring with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (chi2 = 5.90, P &lt; 0.02, odds ratio 1.55, 95% CI 0.91-2.63) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This association could not be explained by linkage disequilibrium between the Ala45 allele and IDDM7 (D2S152), which is also located on chromosome 2q32 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When tested in vitro, the biological activity of Thr45 (117+/-36% vs. Ala45) and His197 (90+/-28% vs. Pro197) on the regulation of the human insulin gene promoter appeared <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, mutations in the NeuroD/BETA2 gene are not a common cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among Danes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, in the type 1 diabetic Danish population, the Ala45Thr variant of NeuroD/BETA2 may represent a susceptibility marker independent of IDDM7 on chromosome 2q32 </plain></SENT>
