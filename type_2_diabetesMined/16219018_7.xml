<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-nine men with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (age=57.4 (7.8) years, BMI=31.7 (2.8) kg/m(2)) underwent exercise testing, registered pedometer activity and reported their physical fitness and activity in a questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants were randomly allocated to an exercise (EX) group (n=15) or a control (CO) group (n=14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Participants in EX group were offered supervised exercise twice a week for 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the end of the study, participants again underwent exercise testing, fasting blood tests and registration of pedometer activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, pedometer activity correlated with VO(2 max) (r=0.43, p=0.02) and with perceived physical fitness (r=0.48, p=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After, but not before, intervention, pedometer activity and VO(2 max) additionally correlated with perceived everyday activity (r=0.62, p&lt;0.01 and r=0.49, p=0.03, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both EX and CO groups tended to increase pedometer activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In EX group, weight decreased by 2.7% (p=0.01), VO(2 max) increased 10.6% (p=0.03) and HbA1c decreased by 5.2% from baseline (p=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In EX group, an increase in pedometer activity correlated with a fall in HbA1c (r=0.84, p&lt;0.01) and in diastolic blood pressure (r=0.77, p=0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Pedometer activity correlates with VO(2 max) in type-2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our exercise programme was well tolerated; it produced favourable effects on body weight, aerobic capacity and metabolic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The use of pedometer may lead to more realistic assessment of perceived everyday physical activity </plain></SENT>
