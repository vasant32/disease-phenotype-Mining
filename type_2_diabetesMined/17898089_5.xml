<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The role of these abnormalities has mainly been examined in animal models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Few studies have been undertaken in diabetic patients, and those that have are limited due to analysis in wounds from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we quantified the rate of wound healing in relation to skin neurovascular function and structure following a dorsal foot skin biopsy in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Twelve healthy control subjects and 12 type 2 diabetic subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> but without macrovascular disease were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We quantified rate of wound healing and related it to skin microvascular function (laser Doppler imager [LDI](max)), blood vessel density, small nerve fiber function (LDI(flare)) and nerve fiber density, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor (FLK1), and <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The rate of wound closure was identical between control subjects and diabetic patients despite a significant reduction in maximum hyperemia (LDI(max)), epidermal and dermal VEGF-A, and epidermal and dermal blood vessel VEGFR-2 expression as well as the neurogenic flare response (LDI(flare)) and dermal nerve fiber density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in HIF-1alpha and dermal blood vessel density between control subjects and diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that wound closure in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is not delayed despite significant alterations in neurovascular function and structure </plain></SENT>
