<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Postulated mechanisms of this observation include prothrombotic effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of elevated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels on blood clotting in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndrome patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 60 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndrome patients within the first 12 h after pain <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, including 20 subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 20 subjects with no diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> but with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels &gt;7.0 mmol/l, and 20 subjects with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels &lt;7.0 mmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We determined generation of thrombin-antithrombin complexes (TATs) and soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L), a platelet activation marker, at the site of microvascular injury, together with ex vivo plasma fibrin clot permeability and lysis time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndrome patients with no prior <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> but elevated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels had increased maximum rates of formation and total production of TATs (by 42.9%, P &lt; 0.0001, and by 25%, P &lt; 0.0001, respectively) as well as sCD40L release (by 16.2%, P = 0.0011, and by 16.3%, P &lt; 0.0001, respectively) compared with those with normoglycemia, whereas diabetic patients had the highest values of TATs and sCD40L variables (P &lt; 0.0001 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> comparisons) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, with no previously diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, had longer clot lysis time (by approximately 18%, P &lt; 0.0001) similar to that in diabetic subjects, but not lower clot permeability compared with that in normoglycemic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>Hyperglycemia</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndrome is associated with enhanced local thrombin generation and platelet activation, as well as unfavorably altered clot features in patients with and without a previous history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
