<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several reports suggest that genetic variants in the adiponectin gene are associated with circulating levels of adiponectin, insulin sensitivity and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently two receptors for adiponectin have been cloned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genetic studies have yielded conflicting results on the role of these genes and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> predisposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study we aimed to evaluate the potential role of genetic variation in these genes in syndromes of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and in related metabolic traits in UK Europid populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Exons and splice junctions of the adiponectin receptor 1 and 2 genes (ADIPOR1; ADIPOR2) were sequenced in patients from our severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> cohort (n=129) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, 24 polymorphisms were tested for association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in population-based type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> case-control studies (n=2,127) and with quantitative traits in a population-based longitudinal study (n=1,721) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No missense or nonsense mutations in ADIPOR1 and ADIPOR2 were detected in the cohort of patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the 24 polymorphisms (allele frequency 2.3-48.3%) tested was associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similarly, none of the polymorphisms was associated with fasting plasma insulin, fasting and 2-h post-load plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, 30-min insulin increment or BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Genetic variation in ADIPOR1 and ADIPOR2 is not a major cause of extreme <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in humans, nor does it contribute in a significant manner to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk and related traits in UK Europid populations </plain></SENT>
