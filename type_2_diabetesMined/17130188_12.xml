<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> increases micro- and macrovascular complications of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal for blood pressure is &lt;130/80 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In primary care, however, blood pressure in many patients exceeds this goal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we evaluated the clinical decision-making process when a patient with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> presents with elevated blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty-six primary care practices in two practice-based research networks in Colorado participated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Questionnaires were completed after each encounter with an adult with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data obtained from the survey included 1) demographic information, 2) blood pressure results, 3) action taken, 4) type of action if action was taken, and 5) reasons for inaction if action was not taken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify predictors of action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Completed surveys totaled 778 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure was 130/74 +/- 18.8/12.0 mmHg (mean +/- SD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sixty-two percent of patients exceeded goals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Action was taken to lower blood pressure in 34.9% of those </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Predictors of action were 1) blood pressure level, 2) total number of medicines the patient was taking, and 3) patient already taking medicines for blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>As blood pressure rose, providers attributed inaction more often to "competing demands" and reasons other than "blood pressure being at or near goal." CONCLUSIONS: No evidence was found for patterns of poor care among primary care physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Providers balance the clinical circumstances, including how elevated the blood pressure is, and issues of polypharmacy, medication side effects, and costs when determining the best course of action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Knowledge deficit is not a common cause of inaction </plain></SENT>
