<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Associations between anthropometric measurements and PBF were evaluated in the TÃ¼bingen Lifestyle Intervention Program (TULIP; 138 men, 222 women), and between these measurements and incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the European Prospective Investigation into <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> and Nutrition (EPIC)-Potsdam study (9,729 men, 15,438 women) and the Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg (KORA) study (5,573 men, 5,628 women), using correlation and multivariate Cox regression analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BMI more strongly correlated with PBF (men: r = 0.81, women: r = 0.84) than BAI (r = 0.68 and 0.81, respectively), while waist circumference among men (r = 0.84) and hip circumference among women (r = 0.88) showed the strongest correlations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BAI overestimated PBF among men (mean difference -3.0%), and this error was dependent on the value of PBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BAI was more weakly associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk (RRs for 1 SD, EPIC-Potsdam men: 1.62 [95% CI 1.52, 1.72], women: 1.67 [95% CI 1.55, 1.80]; KORA men: 1.62 [95% CI 1.48, 1.78], women: 1.82 [95% CI 1.65, 2.02]) compared with BMI (RRs, EPIC-Potsdam men: 1.95 [95% CI 1.83, 2.09], women 1.88 [95% CI 1.76, 2.02], KORA men 1.75 [95% CI 1.62, 1.89], women 2.00 [95% CI 1.81, 2.22]), while waist circumference showed the strongest associations (RRs: 2.17 [95% CI 2.01, 2.35], 2.33 [95% CI 2.15, 2.53], 1.81 [95% CI 1.66, 1.96] and 2.29 [95% CI 2.05, 2.57] for EPIC-Potsdam men and women and KORA men and women, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Waist circumference in men and hip circumference in women are better predictors of PBF than BAI and BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BAI was not as strong a predictor of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> as BMI, while waist circumference was the strongest predictor </plain></SENT>
