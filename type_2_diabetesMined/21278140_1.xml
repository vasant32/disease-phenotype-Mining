<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether there is a difference in the association between nonalcoholic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>fatty liver</z:hpo> disease (NAFLD) and incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> based on the presence of impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 7,849 individuals (5,409 men and 2,440 women) without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, who underwent comprehensive health check-ups annually for 5 years, were categorized into four groups by the presence of impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and NAFLD at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The association between NAFLD and incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was evaluated separately in groups with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For 4 years, the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the NAFLD group was 9.9% compared with 3.7% in the non-NAFLD group, with multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio of 1.33 (95% CI 1.07-1.66) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, this higher risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> only existed in the impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that NAFLD has an independent and additive effect on the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> under conditions of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948379" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">impaired insulin secretion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
