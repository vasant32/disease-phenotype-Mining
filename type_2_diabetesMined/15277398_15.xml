<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two recent studies presented genetic association data on IDE and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (one positive and the other negative), but neither explored the fundamental question of whether polymorphism in IDE has a measurable influence on insulin levels in human populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To address this possibility, 14 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from a linkage disequilibrium block encompassing IDE have been genotyped in a sample of 321 impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerant and 403 nondiabetic control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analyses based on haplotypic genotypes (diplotypes), constructed with SNPs that differentiate common extant haplotypes extending across IDE, provided compelling evidence of association with fasting insulin levels (P = 0.0009), 2-h insulin levels (P = 0.0027), homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (P = 0.0001), and BMI (P = 0.0067), with effects exclusively evident in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The strongest evidence for an effect of a single marker was obtained for rs2251101 (located near the 3' untranslated region of IDE) on 2-h insulin levels (P = 0.000023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diplotype analyses, however, suggest the presence of multiple interacting trait-modifying sequences in the region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results indicate that polymorphism in/near IDE contributes to a large proportion of variance in plasma insulin levels and correlated traits, but questions of sex specificity and allelic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> will need to be taken into consideration as the molecular basis of the observed phenotypic effects unfolds </plain></SENT>
