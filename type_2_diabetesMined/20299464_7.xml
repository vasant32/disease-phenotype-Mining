<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Although advanced age is a risk factor for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, a clear understanding of the changes that occur during middle age that contribute to the development of skeletal muscle <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> is currently lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we sought to investigate how middle age impacts skeletal muscle fatty acid handling and to determine how this contributes to the development of diet-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Whole-body and skeletal muscle <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> were studied in young and middle-aged <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and CD36 knockout (KO) mice fed either a standard or a high-fat diet for 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Molecular signaling pathways, intramuscular <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> accumulation, and targeted metabolomics of in vivo <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> substrate flux were also analyzed in the skeletal muscle of mice of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Middle-aged mice fed a standard diet demonstrated an increase in intramuscular <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> without a concomitant increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, middle-aged mice fed a high-fat diet were more susceptible to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>-a condition that could be prevented by limiting skeletal muscle fatty acid transport and excessive <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> accumulation in middle-aged CD36 KO mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data provide insight into the mechanisms by which aging becomes a risk factor for the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data also demonstrate that limiting skeletal muscle fatty acid transport is an effective approach for delaying the development of age-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disease</z:e> during exposure to a high-fat diet </plain></SENT>
