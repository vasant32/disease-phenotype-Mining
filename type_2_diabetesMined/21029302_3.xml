<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ROS accumulation induces both oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which may lead to β-cell dysfunction and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent data suggest that oxidative and ER stress are interconnected, although the mechanisms involved in nutrient regulation of the different stress pathways are dissimilar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several components of the oxidative and ER stress machineries have important roles in the physiological response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and are thus necessary for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> β-cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> stimulates signalling pathways that provide crucial messages for β-cell adaptation to metabolic stress; however, the same pathways may eventually lead to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dynamic, temporally fluctuating activation of stress signalling is probably required for the maintenance of β-cell survival, whereas its persistent activation results in β-cell dysfunction and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, stress signalling is a 'double-edged sword' that may promote adaptation or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> according to the balance between the divergent outputs of the various pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Developing new strategies for β-cell protection based on inhibition of oxidative and/or ER stress requires comprehensive understanding of the switch from β-cell adaptation to β-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> under conditions of metabolic stress, such as occurs under <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0851834" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemic conditions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
