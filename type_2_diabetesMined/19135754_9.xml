<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty studies were included, with the volume, frequency and intensity of RT varying markedly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Supervised RT improved glycemic control and insulin sensitivity, however, when supervision was removed compliance and glycemic control decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Evidence indicates the mechanisms behind the improvements to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance require further elucidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although research demonstrates apparent benefits of RT for individuals with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, further research is required to elucidate the minimum effective dose by describing frequency, intensity and the duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> improvements </plain></SENT>
