<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in the city center of Sivas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study population of 771 subjects was selected by the cluster sampling method from 115,998 individuals aged &gt; or =30 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Participants with fasting venous plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations &lt;100 mg/dl were classified as "<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>." <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> was diagnosed in participants if they had fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels &gt; or =126 mg/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) was performed in subjects with fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels &gt; or =100 mg/dl and &lt;126 mg/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: According to the fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels of the 771 subjects, 44 (5.7%) had <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>OGTTs were performed in 80 (10.4%) subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>According to OGTT results, there were 5 subjects with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 20 subjects with IGT (2.6%), and 55 subjects with IFG (7.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The combined prevalence of IFG and IGT was 9.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After OGTT, the total number of diabetic subjects was determined to be 49 (6.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four (3.1%) of the subjects had a previous diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analyses showed that age, sex, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, cigarette smoking, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were risk factors for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> incidence increases with changes in dietary habits and lifestyle </plain></SENT>
