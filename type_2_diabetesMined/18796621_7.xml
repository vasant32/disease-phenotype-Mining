<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A quasi-experimental two-group study was undertaken with 122 participants with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk factors; 36.9% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) or impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (IFG) at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The intervention included a 6-week group self-management education program, a gymnasium-based or home-based 12-week resistance training program, and a 34-week maintenance program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) and 2-h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, blood <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, blood pressure, body composition, physical activity, and diet were assessed at baseline and week 52 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean 2-h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and FPG fell by 0.34 mmol/l (95% CI -0.60 to -0.08) and 0.15 mmol/l (-0.23 to -0.07), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The proportion of participants with IFG or IGT decreased from 36.9 to 23.0% (P = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> was 4.07 kg (-4.99 to -3.15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The only significant difference between resistance training groups was a greater reduction in systolic blood pressure for the gymnasium-based group (P = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This intervention significantly improved <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnostic status and reduced <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk to a degree comparable to that of other low-resource-intensive lifestyle modification programs and more intensive interventions applied to individuals with IGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The effects of home-based and gymnasium-based resistance training did not differ significantly </plain></SENT>
