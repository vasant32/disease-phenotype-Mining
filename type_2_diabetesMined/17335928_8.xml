<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 94 diabetic patients and 36 healthy people, plasma levels of TRAP, as a marker of antioxidative defence, as well as concentrations of CO, SH, and NH(2) groups and AOPP, as markers of oxidative protein damage (OPD) were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients had significantly lower levels of TRAP and SH groups, as well as higher NH(2), CO and AOPP in comparison to control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Significant correlation was observed between TRAP and SH groups and AOPP as well as between AOPP and SH and CO groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Concentration of AOPP was significantly higher in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096293" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">macroangiopathy</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the idea that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> is a complex <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disorder</z:e> with oxidant/<z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> defence disturbances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the studied parameters AOPP showed the most expressive raise in plasma of diabetic patients and significant differences between their subgroups with vascular complications and overweight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We can conclude that AOPP seems to be considered as a useful marker to estimate the degree of OPD in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
