<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of saxagliptin (2.5, 5, or 10 mg once daily) or placebo plus a stable dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (1,500-2,500 mg) in 743 patients (A1C &gt; or =7.0 and &lt; or =10.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Efficacy analyses were performed using an ANCOVA model using last observation carried forward methodology on primary (A1C) and secondary (fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> [FPG] and postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> [<z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi>] area under the curve [AUC]) end points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Saxagliptin (2.5, 5, and 10 mg) plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> demonstrated statistically significant adjusted mean decreases from baseline to week 24 versus placebo in A1C (-0.59, -0.69, and -0.58 vs. +0.13%; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.0001), FPG (-14.31, -22.03, and -20.50 vs. +1.24 mg/dl; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.0001), and <z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi> AUC (-8,891, -9,586, and -8,137 vs. -3,291 mg . min/dl; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>More than twice as many patients achieved A1C &lt;7.0% with 2.5, 5, and 10 mg saxagliptin versus placebo (37, 44, and 44 vs. 17%; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>beta-Cell function and postprandial C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, insulin, and glucagon AUCs improved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> saxagliptin treatment groups at week 24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Incidence of hypoglycemic adverse events and weight reductions were similar to those with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Saxagliptin once daily added to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> therapy was generally well tolerated and led to statistically significant improvements in glycemic indexes versus placebo added to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> inadequately controlled with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> alone </plain></SENT>
