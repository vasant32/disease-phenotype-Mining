<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BMAL1 is a key component of the mammalian molecular clock </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two SNPs in the BMAL1 gene have been identified to confer T2D susceptibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study we investigated for the first time the association between the BMAL1 gene and the risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e>, in a Greek population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 185 women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> and 161 non-diabetic controls for BMAL1 polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For BMAL1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression, peripheral leukocytes were harvested from 20 GDM and 20 control women, harboring different genotypes for the tested polymorphisms, using real-time quantitative PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The minor allele (A) of the BMAL1 rs7950226 (G&gt;A) polymorphism was found to be significantly associated with an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> (P=0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the second BMAL1 rs11022775 (T&gt;C) polymorphism, showed that the C-allele frequency was strongly increased in women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> (P=4.455e-06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The CC genotype was also significantly overrepresented in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> vs. controls (P=0.00001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the rs7950226G/rs11022775C and rs7950226A/rs11022775C haplotypes were also found to be associated with increased susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the expression levels of BMAL1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were significantly lower in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> patients than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data suggest that the impairment of the BMAL1 clock gene expression is closely associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> susceptibility </plain></SENT>
