<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this randomized multicenter double-blind parallel-group study, 356 type 2 diabetic subjects with similar mean baseline characteristics (age 54 years, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration 4.9 years, BMI 32.1 kg/m(2), A1C 8.0%) received subcutaneous placebo or albiglutide (weekly [4, 15, or 30 mg], biweekly [15, 30, or 50 mg], or monthly [50 or 100 mg]) or exenatide twice daily as an open-label active reference (per labeling in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> subjects only) over 16 weeks followed by an 11-week washout period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The main outcome measure was change from baseline A1C of albiglutide groups versus placebo at week 16 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Dose-dependent reductions in A1C were observed within <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> albiglutide schedules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean A1C was similarly reduced from baseline by albiglutide 30 mg weekly, 50 mg biweekly (every 2 weeks), and 100 mg monthly (-0.87, -0.79, and -0.87%, respectively) versus placebo (-0.17%, P &lt; 0.004) and exenatide (-0.54%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>Weight loss</z:hpo> (-1.1 to -1.7 kg) was observed with these three albiglutide doses with no significant between-group effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events in subjects receiving albiglutide 30 mg weekly was less than that observed for the highest biweekly and monthly doses of albiglutide or exenatide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Weekly albiglutide administration significantly improved glycemic control and elicited <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> in type 2 diabetic patients, with a favorable safety and tolerability profile </plain></SENT>
