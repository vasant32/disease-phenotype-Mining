<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe and analyze medical care costs for the 8 years preceding a diagnosis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: From electronic records of a large group-model health maintenance organization (HMO), we ascertained the medical care costs preceding diagnosis for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> members with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were newly diagnosed between 1988 and 1995 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To isolate incremental costs (costs caused by the future diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>), we subtracted the costs of individually age- and sex-matched HMO members without impending <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from the costs of members who were destined to receive this diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also compared these prediagnosis costs with the first 3 years of postdiagnosis costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An economic burden from impending <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is apparent for at least 8 years before diagnosis, beginning with costs for outpatient and pharmacy services </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp>-associated incremental costs (costs of type 2 diabetic patients minus matched costs of nondiabetic patients) averaged $1,205 per type 2 diabetic patient per year during the first eight prediagnostic years, including $1,913 each year for the 3 years preceding diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the year immediately preceding diagnosis, incremental costs were equivalent to those observed in the second and third years after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Incremental costs of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> begin at least 8 years before diagnosis and grow at an accelerating rate as diagnosis approaches and immediately after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These incremental costs span the full range of medical services </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the majority of these costs are for conditions not normally associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or its complications </plain></SENT>
