<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether clinically significant differences exist in fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (BG) at the forearm, palm, and thigh relative to the fingertip; to assess the impact of prandial status by comparing BG between alternative sites and the fingertip at several time intervals after carbohydrate intake; to assess the effects of moderate brief exercise on site-to-site differences in BG; to evaluate the impact of site preparation by local rubbing on alternative-site testing (AST) equivalence; and to determine levels of perceived pain and satisfaction associated with AST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Fasting BG was measured using the One Touch Ultra (LifeScan, Milpitas, CA) at the fingertip, palm, thigh, and each forearm (with local rubbing) in 86 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 40-g carbohydrate meal was consumed and BG was again measured from each site at 60, 90, and 120 min postmeal, with an additional forearm test at 90 min without local rubbing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients then exercised for 15 min with repeat BG at each site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Differences in BG between sites were assessed using repeated-measures ANOVA and regression analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant differences in BG at alternative sites were found 60 min postmeal (P = 0.0003) and postexercise (P = 0.037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Specifically, clinically significant differences (expressed as percent difference from the fingertip) at 60 min include -8.8 +/- 10.8% at the forearm and -13.7 +/- 10.7% at the thigh, and postexercise +19.1 +/- 19.1% at the forearm and +15.6 +/- 22.6% at the thigh </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, no significant differences were observed between sites in either the fasting state or at 90 and 120 min postmeal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The dynamic results suggest a time lag in equilibration of forearm and thigh BG during periods of rapid <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Palm and fingertip BG test results were similar at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: AST results are consistent with fingertip BG results in both the fasting state and 2 h postmeal; no benefit from site preparation by local rubbing was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, testing at sites other than the hand cannot be recommended 1 h postmeal or immediately after exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>AST is equivalent and appropriate for use at testing times commonly used in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
