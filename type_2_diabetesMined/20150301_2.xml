<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Incident cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in youth aged 0-17 years were identified from the Chicago Childhood <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Registry between 1994 and 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Those with a type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-like clinical course or related indicators were classified as non-type 1 diabetic; the remaining cases were considered to have type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with stable diversity neighborhoods, significant associations for type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were found for younger children residing in emerging low-income neighborhoods (relative risk 0.56 [95% CI 0.36-0.90]) and older children residing in emerging high-income neighborhoods (1.52 [1.17-1.98]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For non-type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, older youth residing in desertification neighborhoods were at increased risk (1.47 [1.09-1.99]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics in Chicago may be associated with the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in youth </plain></SENT>
