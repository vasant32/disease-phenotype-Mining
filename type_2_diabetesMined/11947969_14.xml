<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study in Southern Spain of 1226 people, age 18-65 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical data were obtained and a blood sample taken to measure autoantibodies (glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies (GADAb), tyrosine phosphatase antibodies (IA2Ab), and insulin antibodies (<z:mp ids='MP_0004157'>IAA</z:mp>)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) was also given to 982 of the subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> according to the WHO 1979 criteria was 10.9% and according to the <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> 1997 criteria it was 14.7% (8.8% were unaware of their <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (IFG) was 12.4% and of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) 11.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of GADAb+ in the general population was 0.9% and in the diabetic population 3.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between groups in the prevalence of IA2Ab or <z:mp ids='MP_0004157'>IAA</z:mp> (both were 0.8% in the general population) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the three autoantibodies studied, only GADAb were significantly different in the diabetic population (P=0.0006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and LADA are high in the south of Spain </plain></SENT>
