<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> 1 (GLP-1) exhibits considerable potential for the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> because of its effects on stimulation of insulin secretion and the inhibition of gastric emptying, appetite, and glucagon secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, native GLP-1 undergoes rapid enzymatic inactivation, prompting development of long-acting degradation-resistant GLP-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> such as exendin-4 (Ex-4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To study the consequences of sustained exposure to Ex-4, we generated metallothionein promoter-exendin-4 (MT-Exendin) mice that continuously express a proexendin-4 transgene in multiple murine tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We now report that MT-Exendin mice develop extensive tissue <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1262091" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lymphocytic infiltration</z:e> with increased numbers of CD4(+) and CD8a(+) cells in the liver and/or kidney and increased numbers of B220(+) cells present in the pancreas and liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MT-Exendin mice generate antibodies directed against Ex-4, exendin NH(2)-terminal <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (ENTP), and proexendin-4 as well as antibodies that cross-react with native GLP-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, lymphocytes isolated from MT-Exendin mice proliferate in response to proexendin-4 but not after exposure to Ex-4 or ENTP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate that expression of a proexendin-4 transgene may be associated with activation of humoral and cellular immune responses in mice </plain></SENT>
