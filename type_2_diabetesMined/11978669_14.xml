<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We typed three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the calpain-10 gene (SNPs 43, 56, and 63) to test for association between variation at these loci and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related traits in 1,603 Finnish subjects: two samples of 526 (Finland-U.S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Investigation of <z:mp ids='MP_0002057'>NIDDM</z:mp> Genetics [FUSION] 1) and 255 (FUSION 2) index case subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 185 and 414 unaffected spouses and offspring of FUSION 1 index case subjects or their affected siblings, and 223 elderly <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-tolerant control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found no significant differences in allele, genotype, haplotype, or haplogenotype frequencies between index case subjects with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the elderly and spouse control populations (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &gt; 0.087) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although variation in these three SNPs was associated with variation in some type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related traits within each of the case and control groups, no consistent pattern of the implicated variant or combination of variants was discerned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that variation in these three SNPs in the calpain-10 gene is unlikely to confer susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in this Finnish cohort </plain></SENT>
