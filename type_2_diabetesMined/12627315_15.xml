<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During a 1-year period (1998), blood samples were taken at diagnosis and 4 months (median) thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified according to clinical judgement by the reporting physicians and assessments of islet antibodies (ICA, GADA, and IA-2A) and plasma C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 1998, 422 patients were registered in DISS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the 313 patients participating in the follow-up, most with clinical Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (185/218, 85%, 95% CI 79-89%) were islet antibody positive (ab+) at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, 14 out of 58 (24%, 14-37%) with clinical Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 21 out of 37 (57%, 40-73%) with unclassifiable <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were antibody positive at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further to this, 4 out of 33 (12%, 3-28%) were antibody negative with clinical Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 4 out of 44 (9%, 3-22%) with Type 2 had converted to antibody positive at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among those who were constantly antibody negative, 10 out of 29 (34%, 18-54%) with clinical Type 1 and 1 out of 16 (6%, 0-30%) with unclassifiable <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had fasting plasma C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> concentrations below the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range (&lt;0.25 nmol/l) at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: Most young adults with clinical Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (199/218, 91%) had objective Type 1 (ab+ at diagnosis/follow-up and/or low fasting plasma C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> concentrations at follow-up), as did one third (18/58, 31%) with clinical Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and more than half (22/37, 59%) with unclassifiable <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>About 10% of those who were antibody negative converted to antibody positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our study underlines that a classification considering aetiology is superior to clinical judgement </plain></SENT>
