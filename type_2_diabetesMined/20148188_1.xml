<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Exogenous GLP-1 administration at pharmacological doses results in many effects that are beneficial for treating type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, these include: (1) an increase in insulin secretion from beta cells; (2) a suppression of glucagon secretion from alpha cells in the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>; (3) a delay in gastric emptying and gut motility which in turns delays absorption of ingested nutrients and dampens post-prandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excursion; and (4) an increase in the duration of postprandial satiety therefore suppressing appetite and decreasing food intake which eventually leads to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, GLP-1 is subject to rapid enzymatic degradation, and therefore, not suitable for long-term treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A synthetic enzyme-resistant GLP-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> that reproduces the biological effects of GLP-1 is in use and more are under development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This review aims at providing a summary of the properties of GLP-1 and the development of GLP-1-based therapies for treatment of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
