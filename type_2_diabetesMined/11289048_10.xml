<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A drug that promotes the initiation of IR signaling by enhancing IR autophosphorylation should, therefore, be useful for treating type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This report describes the effect of a small molecule IR sensitizer, TLK16998, on IR signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This compound activated the tyrosine kinase domain of the IR beta-subunit at concentrations of 1 micromol/l or less but had no effect on insulin binding to the IR alpha-subunit even at much higher concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TLK16998 alone had no effect on IR signaling in mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes but, at concentrations as low as 3.2 micromol/l, enhanced the effects of insulin on the phosphorylation of the IR beta-subunit and IR substrate 1, and on the amount of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase that coimmunoprecipitated with IRS-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Phosphopeptide mapping revealed that the effect of TLK16998 on the IR was associated with increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the activation loop of the beta-subunit tyrosine kinase domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TLK16998 also increased the potency of insulin in stimulating <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15866">2-deoxy-D-glucose</z:chebi> uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, with a detectable effect at 8 micromol/l and a 10-fold increase at 40 micromol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, only small effects were observed on IGF-1-stimulated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15866">2-deoxy-D-glucose</z:chebi> uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In diabetic mice, TLK16998, at a dose of 10 mg/kg, lowered blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels for up to 6 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest, therefore, that small nonpeptide molecules that directly sensitize the IR may be useful for treating type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
