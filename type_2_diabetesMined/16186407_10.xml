<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The gene encoding calpain-10 (CAPN10) has been identified as a candidate gene for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to study the impact of genetic (heritability and polymorphisms) and nongenetic (insulin, free fatty acids, and age) factors on CAPN10 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in skeletal muscle using two different study designs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Muscle biopsies were obtained before and after hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps from 166 young and elderly monozygotic and dizygotic twins as well as from 15 subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (NGT) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) exposed to an Intralipid infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found hereditary effects on both basal and insulin-exposed CAPN10 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Carriers of the type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-associated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-43 G/G genotype had reduced CAPN10 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels compared with subjects carrying the SNP-43 A-allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Age had no significant influence on CAPN10 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Insulin had no significant effect on CAPN10 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels, neither in the twins nor in the basal state of the Intralipid study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, after a 24-h infusion of Intralipid, we noted a significant increase in CAPN10 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in response to insulin in subjects with NGT but not in subjects with IGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we provide evidence that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of CAPN10 in skeletal muscle is under genetic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi>-tolerant but not <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-intolerant individuals upregulate their CAPN10 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels in response to prolonged exposure to fat </plain></SENT>
