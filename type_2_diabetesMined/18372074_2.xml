<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study was conducted within Swedish primary health care and included 102 patients (mean age 63 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At clinic level they were randomised into control or intervention groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The intervention directed at patients consisted of ten two-hour group sessions over 9 months, focusing on patients' own needs and questions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean HbA1c at baseline was 5.71% (S.D </plain></SENT>
