<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously reported association between variants in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytoma</z:hpo> variant translocation gene (PVT1) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e> attributed to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Pima Indians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to evaluate the extent to which these variants mediate susceptibility in other populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We genotyped 24 markers showing the strongest evidence for association in Pima Indians in unrelated Caucasians with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from the Genetics of Kidneys in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> (GoKinD) study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study sample was comprised of 531 case subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e> and 564 control subjects with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration &gt;20 years and a maximum urinary albumin-to-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio &lt;150 mg/g </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Markers rs13447075 (odds ratio [OR] 1.47 [95% CI 1.14-1.89] per copy of A allele; P = 0.003) and rs2648862 (2.66 [1.19-5.92] per copy of C allele; P = 0.008) were strongly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e> in analyses adjusting for age(2), age(3), duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and smoking status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We further identified a common haplotype containing the C allele at rs10808565 and the A allele at rs13447075 that was associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e> (P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PVT1 gene expression yields several isoforms, and rs13447075 is located within the coding region of one of these transcript variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We identified expression of this isoform in four major human kidney cell types, including mesangial, cortical epithelial, epithelial, and proximal tubule cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results are the first to provide confirmatory evidence supporting a role for PVT1 in mediating susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e> attributable to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
