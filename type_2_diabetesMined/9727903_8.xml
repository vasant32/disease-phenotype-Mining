<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine if there is a correlation between high blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and serum ceruloplasmin (Cp) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Serum Cp levels were measured in 637 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For the follow-up type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> group, 161 patients who had not had any changes in their situation during the last year that are known to influence serum Cp levels were reexamined 1 year later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The control group was composed of 158 healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum Cp and blood HbA1c levels were measured by radial immunodiffusion and high-performance liquid chromatography assays, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum Cp levels in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> group were significantly higher than those in the control group (P &lt; 0.0001), although the serum Cp levels did not correlate with the blood HbA1c levels in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> group (r = 0.055, P = 0.351) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Then we evaluated those factors (delta-log Cp and delta-HbA1c) in the follow-up type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> group to minimize changes from the genetic differences and to exclude any known factors influencing serum Cp levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This indicated that the delta-HbA1c had a positive correlation to the delta-log Cp (r = 0.304, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A persistent high blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (namely HbA1c) is associated with an increase in serum Cp levels over 1 year </plain></SENT>
