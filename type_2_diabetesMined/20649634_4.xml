<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is associated with increased expression of IAPP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As GLP-1-based therapy is currently developed as a novel <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> therapy, we examined the potential protective action of the GLP-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> exendin-4 on hIAPP-induced beta-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study was performed in clonal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021670" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">insulinoma</z:e> (INS-1E) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both method of transcriptional and translational and sulphorhodamine B (SRB) assays were used to evaluate cell viability and cell mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis was applied to detect protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transfection of constitutively active protein kinase B (PKB/AKT) was performed to examine the role of AKT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>Mitochondrial</z:hpo> biogenesis was quantified by mitogreen staining and RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: First, we confirmed that hIAPP induced cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and growth inhibition in INS-1E cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These effects were partially protected by exendin-4 in association with partial recovery of the hIAPP-mediated AKT inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, AKT constitutive activation attenuated hIAPP-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, whereas PI3K/AKT inhibition abrogated exendin-4-mediated effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the antiapoptotic and proliferative effects of exendin-4 in hIAPP-treated INS-1E cells were partially mediated through AKT pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Moreover, hIAPP induced FOXO1 but inhibited pdx-1 nucleus translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These effects were restored by exendin-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Finally, mitogreen staining and RT-PCR revealed enhanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> biogenesis by exendin-4 treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these results suggest that GLP-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> protects beta cells from hIAPP-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> partially through the activation of AKT pathway and improved <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> function </plain></SENT>
