<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, the majority of adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> do not regularly engage in physical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to assess physical activity behavior and its correlates (i.e., physical activity knowledge, barriers, and performance and outcome expectations) in older adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A subgroup of 260 adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was identified from a larger stratified random sample of adults aged &gt; or = 55 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Participants completed an interviewer-administered survey designed from focus group findings and social learning theory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The majority of the respondents (54.6%) reported 0 min of weekly physical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was especially true of older female respondents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Performance expectation scores were lower among respondents who were in the oldest age-group, namely, white women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Physical activity knowledge varied by age-group, and barriers to physical activity were prevalent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The following are significant correlates of reported weekly physical activity: younger age, more education, fewer motivational barriers, and greater perceived health and performance expectations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Given the importance of physical activity to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> management, the low prevalence of physical activity found in this and other studies should raise concerns among clinicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Future research to identify predictors of physical activity is needed to guide clinicians in the promotion of physical activity </plain></SENT>
