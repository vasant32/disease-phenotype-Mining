<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> deficiency in men has been linked with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e>, whether it predisposes to, or is a consequence of, type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) is still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between plasma <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> levels, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, metabolic status and T2DM in men of 70 years or older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: A sample of 195 men from the Australian Longitudinal Study of Ageing with a mean age of 76.2 +/- 0.3 years were followed up for 8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Total <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> (TT), fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG), urate, serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, total cholesterol (TC), <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (TG), blood pressure (BP), body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC) and diabetic status were assessed at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Self-reported diabetic status was obtained after 8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Metabolic syndrome</z:e> was diagnosed based on the Third National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel clinical criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TT levels were lower in diabetic men compared with non-diabetic men (12.1 +/- 0.7 vs. 14.2 +/- 0.4 nmol/l, p = 0.026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TT levels in healthy, non-diabetic men over 80 years of age were lower (11.9 +/- 0.8 vs. 15.0 +/- 0.5 nmol/l, p = 0.002) than TT levels in those aged 70-79 years, inversely related to BMI (r = -0.26, p = 0.001), WC (r = -0.30, p &lt; 0.001) and TG (r = -0.22, p = 0.005) and positively related to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> (r = 0.25, p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Men with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> had significantly lower levels of TT and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>, and higher values of BP, FPG, TG, BMI and WC, compared with those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, no significant difference in plasma TT levels was noted between men with incident T2Dm and healthy men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Stepwise linear regression analysis revealed that only <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> and WC related significantly to the variance of TT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression revealed FPG to be the only independent predictor of incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (odds ratio = 60.2, p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">Testosterone</z:chebi> levels continue to decline even in healthy men over the age of 80 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although TT levels were inversely related to visceral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and several components of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e>, our data do not support a predictive or causative role for decreasing TT levels in the development of incident T2Dm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">Androgen</z:chebi> deficiency is consequent upon, rather than a cause of, poor metabolic status </plain></SENT>
