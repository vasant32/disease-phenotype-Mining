<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are among the most serious health pathologies worldwide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Stress has been proposed as a factor contributing to the development of these health risk factors; however, the underlying mechanisms that link stress to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> need to be further clarified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we study in mice how <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stress affects dietary consumption and how that relationship contributes to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: C57BL/6J mice were subjected to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> variable stress (CVS) for 15 days and subsequently fed with a standard chow or high-fat diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Food intake, body weight, respiratory quotient, energy expenditure and spontaneous physical activity were measured with a customised calorimetric system and body composition was measured with nuclear magnetic resonance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test was also applied and blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were measured with a glucometer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma levels of adiponectin and resistin were measured using Lincoplex kits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mice under CVS and fed with a high-fat diet showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> associated with low plasma adiponectin:resistin ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: This study demonstrates, in a novel mouse model, how <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038436" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="PTSD">post-traumatic stress disorder</z:e> enhances vulnerability for impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in an energy-rich environment and proposes a potential adipokine-based mechanism </plain></SENT>
