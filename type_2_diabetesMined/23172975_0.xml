<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Participants had type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, were not taking prandial insulin, and interpreted the RT-CGM data independently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Data were from the first 12 weeks of a 52-week, prospective, randomized trial comparing RT-CGM (n = 50) with self-monitoring of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (n = 50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RT-CGM was used in 8 of the first 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A1C was collected at baseline and quarterly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This analysis included 45 participants who wore the RT-CGM â‰¥4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analyses examined the RT-CGM data for common response patterns-a novel approach in this area of research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It then used multilevel models for longitudinal data, regression, and nonparametric methods to compare the patterns of A1C, mean <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, glycemic variability, and views per day of the RT-CGM device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS There were five patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For four patterns, mean <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was lower than expected as of the first RT-CGM cycle of use given participants' baseline A1C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We named them favorable response but with high and variable <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (n = 7); tight control (n = 14); worsening glycemia (n = 6); and incremental improvement (n = 11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The fifth was no response (n = 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A1C, mean <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, glycemic variability, and views per day differed across patterns at baseline and longitudinally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS The patterns identified suggest that targeting people with higher starting A1Cs, using it short-term (e.g., 2 weeks), and monitoring for worsening glycemia that might be the result of burnout may be the best approach to using RT-CGM in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> not taking prandial insulin </plain></SENT>
