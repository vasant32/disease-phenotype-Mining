<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Impaired lung function and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> have both attracted interest as potentially novel risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that circulating levels of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35195">surfactant</z:chebi> protein (SP)-A, which reflects interstitial lung injury, could be associated with altered <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Circulating SP-A concentration and metabolic variables (including insulin sensitivity by minimal model method, n = 89) were measured in 164 nonsmoking men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Circulating SP-A concentration was significantly higher among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than in subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, even after adjustment for BMI, age, and smoking status (ex/never) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most significant differences were found in overweight and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects with altered <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (n = 59) who showed significantly increased serum SP-A concentrations (by a mean of 24%) compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (n = 58) (log SP-A 1.54 +/- 0.13 vs. 1.44 +/- 0.13; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity (P = 0.003) contributed independently to 22% of SP-A variance among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In subjects with altered <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, insulin sensitivity (P = 0.01) and fasting <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (P = 0.02) contributed to 37% of SP-A variance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Controlling for serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> or C-reactive protein in these models did not significantly change the results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Lung-derived SP-A protein was associated with altered <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in 164 nonsmoking men </plain></SENT>
