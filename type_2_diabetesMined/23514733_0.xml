<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Literature suggests that interleukin (IL)-1β may contribute to the pathogenesis of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to determine the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of LY2189102, a neutralizing IL-1β antibody, in T2DM patients.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSPhase II, randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled study of subcutaneous LY2189102 (0.6, 18, and 180 mg) administered weekly for 12 weeks in T2DM patients on diet and exercise, with or without approved <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> medications.RESULTSLY2189102 reduced HbA1c at 12 weeks (adjusted mean differences versus placebo: -0.27, -0.38 and -0.25% for 0.6, 18 and 180 mg doses, respectively), and fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> at multiple time points compared with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>LY2189102 also reduced postprandial glycemia, and inflammatory biomarkers, including hs-CRP and IL-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LY2189102 was generally well tolerated.CONCLUSIONSWeekly subcutaneous LY2189102 for 12 weeks was well tolerated, modestly reduced HbA1c and fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and demonstrated significant anti-inflammatory effects in T2DM patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neutralizing IL-1β holds promise as a convenient adjuvant treatment for T2DM </plain></SENT>
