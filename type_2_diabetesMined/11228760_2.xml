<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Leptin levels in the overweight and differences between men and women may be confounded by sex hormones in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-related type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We carried out a study of leptin and <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> and the effect of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on this relationship in 71 Chinese subjects (51 with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 20 healthy non-diabetics) of whom 32 were overweight (body mass index (b.m.i.) &gt; 25.0 kg/m2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Leptin levels were similar in the diabetic (median 7.4, interquartile range 4.2-10.6 ng ml-1) and non-diabetic (11.3 (6.0-16.3) ng ml-1) subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">Testosterone</z:chebi> and free <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> in diabetics and non-diabetics were similar for both gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regardless of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> status, <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> and its free form tend to increase in overweight women and decrease in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Leptin correlated with <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> in women with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (Pearson correlation coefficient r = 0.495, p = 0.037) but not in diabetic men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sixty-eight per cent of leptin variance was affected by b.m.i, insulin, sex (female) and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> status in a regression model that excluded <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> (total and free) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> and insulin were predictors of leptin changes in the non-diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, b.m.i., sex (female) and insulin remained as predictors of leptin changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that apart from body <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e>, <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> also influences leptin levels and that <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> has a significant effect on this association </plain></SENT>
