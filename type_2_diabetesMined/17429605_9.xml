<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because several studies have suggested that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15378">H(+)</z:chebi> exchanger (NHE1) plays a part in the molecular mechanisms involved in <z:mp ids='MP_0001625'>cardiac hypertrophy</z:mp>, we investigated its activity and its role in LV myocytes from the Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rat model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fluorometric measurements were used to assess sarcolemmal NHE1 activity in isolated myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NHE1 levels and the possible molecular pathways driving and/or related to NHE1 activity were investigated in relation to the diabetic LV phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Enhanced NHE1 activity was associated with LV myocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This occurred in the absence of any change in NHE1 protein levels; however, activation of several molecular pathways related to NHE1 activity was demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (Erk), of the protein kinase Akt (also known as protein kinase B) and of the Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase II was increased in GK LV myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intracellular Ca(2+) levels were also increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> treatment (10-12 weeks) with the NHE1 inhibitor cariporide normalised NHE1 activity, decreased [Formula: see text] levels and reduced LV myocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, among the various activated pathways, cariporide treatment markedly reduced Akt activity only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These findings indicate that activation of the Akt pathway represents a likely mechanism mediating the hypertrophic effect of increased NHE1 activity in the GK model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
