<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo>, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> levels, family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and glycemic control were risk factors used to define the score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A score of 1 (lowest likelihood IRS) to 3 (highest likelihood IRS) was assigned for each risk factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eligible subjects (n = 24) were recruited from the <z:chebi fb="107" ids="27789">EDC</z:chebi> cohort based on tertile of IRS score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects received an overnight insulin infusion to normalize <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, then underwent a 3-h euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic (60 mU x m(-2) x min(-1)) clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> disposal rate (GDR) was determined during the last 30 min of the clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The GDR differed significantly by IRS group (9.65 +/- 2.99, 8.02 +/- 1.39, and 5.68 +/- 2.16 mg x kg(-1) x min(-1), P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The GDR was inversely correlated with the IRS score (r = -0.64, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using linear regression, the combination of risk factors that yielded the highest adjusted r2 value (0.57, P &lt; 0.001) were WHR, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and HbA1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study found that clinical risk factors can be used to identify subjects with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who are insulin resistant, and it provides validation of a score based on clinical factors to determine the extent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This score will be applied to the entire <z:chebi fb="107" ids="27789">EDC</z:chebi> population in future studies to determine the effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> on complications </plain></SENT>
