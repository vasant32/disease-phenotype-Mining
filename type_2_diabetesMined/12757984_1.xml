<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Laboratory examination showed elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000100'>nephrotic syndrome</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Her blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level had been well controlled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Streptococcus agalactiae was detected in both the skin lesion and blood culture, and pathological examination revealed neutrophil infiltration in the fascia and muscle layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient was diagnosed with necrotizing <z:hpo ids='HP_0100537'>fasciitis</z:hpo>, septic shock and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005521'>disseminated intravascular coagulation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although this organism is not virulent and rarely causes a necrotizing <z:hpo ids='HP_0100537'>fasciitis</z:hpo>, both the superficial fascial layer and underlying muscle were affected in this case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There have been only a few reports of necrotizing <z:hpo ids='HP_0100537'>fasciitis</z:hpo> due to S. agalactiae in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although the blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level was well controlled in our patient, this disease might be caused by other factors, including diminished sense of touch and pain, abnormality of microcirculation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004313'>hypogammaglobulinemia</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000100'>nephrotic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
