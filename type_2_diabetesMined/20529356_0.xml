<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Inflammatory cytokines are linked to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and may predict type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> independently of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that a majority of a cohort of 73 non-diabetic women with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma (p-)<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> with Amerindian heritage in Lima, Peru, during a 5-year period increased both body weight and p-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, yet p-insulin was unaltered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A high proportion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28716">palmitoleic acid</z:chebi> (16:1n-7) in serum (s) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) were independent predictors of high p-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Whether cytokines also contributed is, however, not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During 5 years we prospectively investigated the relation between changed concentrations of p-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF)-alpha, p-interleukin (IL)-6 and circulating insulin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in relation to the natural variation of body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Study variables included anthropometric measurements, p-insulin, TNF-alpha, IL-6, SBP and the proportion of 16:1n-7 in s-fatty acid composition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Weight and waist differences correlated negatively to the difference in p-TNF-alpha but positively to differences in p-IL-6 and p-insulin, whereas the increase of p-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> from baseline to follow-up did not correlate with changes in levels of the two cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multiple regression analysis changes of TNF-alpha and insulin contributed independently to the variance in weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>P-insulin at baseline and weight change were determinants of fasting p-insulin at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multiple regression analysis revealed that weight change (t-value = - 2.42; P = 0.018) and waist change (t-value = 2.41; P = 0.019) together with S-16:1n-7 (p &lt; 0.0001) and SBP (p = 0.0005) at baseline were significant predictors of p-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our prospective study of Amerindian women revealed disassociations between changes in p-TNF-alpha and p-IL-6 in relation to variation in body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A high proportion of s-16:1n-7, SBP at baseline together with weight and waist changes were independent predictors of p-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The exact role of the opposite effects and clinical impact of p-TNF-alpha and p-IL-6 on loss and gain of body weight and indirectly on the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> is not known </plain></SENT>
