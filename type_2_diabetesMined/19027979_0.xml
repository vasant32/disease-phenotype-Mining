<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Equations to predict <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance (Ccr) or glomerular filtration rate have limitations in applying to a wide range of ethnicities with different fat-free mass (FFM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine the serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> (Scr) concentrations that indicate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal insufficiency</z:hpo> and formulate a new equation to estimate Ccr by a function of FFM in Korean type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ccr was measured in 283 type 2 diabetic patients by 24-h urine collection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine the Scr concentration corresponding to a Ccr of 60 mL min(-1) x 1.73 m(-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A new equation to predict Ccr was derived by using Scr and FFM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The Scr concentration corresponding to a Ccr of 60 mL min(-1) x 1.73 m(-2) was 1.15 mg/dL in men and 0.95 mg/dL in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The regression equation estimating the Ccr was expressed as (1.72 x FFM-0.23 x age)/Scr, and it showed a good correlation with the measured Ccr (r=0.718, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Scr concentrations indicating <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal insufficiency</z:hpo> in the Korean patients were considerably lower than those in Caucasians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The equation derived in this study would be more useful in Korean or other Asian type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
