<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Despite the use of a wide range of different methodologies and diagnostic criteria, epidemiological studies have shown that Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> has a global distribution and its prevalence varies from country to country, in different ethnic groups in the same country, and between the same ethnic group undergoing internal or external migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rural-urban and migration studies indicate that change towards a 'Westernized' lifestyle is associated with a dramatic increase in the prevalence rates for Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Between populations, comparisons are confounded by a wide range of different ascertainment rates, survey methodologies, and diagnostic criteria for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, low prevalence rates for Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are seen in Eskimos and populations of the Far East, while the highest are seen in American Indians, urbanized Pacific Island populations, and migrant Asian Indians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Available evidence suggests that these latter groups have a genetic susceptibility to Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> ('<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> genotype') and that the disease is unmasked by environmental factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There appears to be a spectrum of interaction between genetic and environmental factors--in certain populations the genetic role may be more important than environmental, or vice versa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Epidemiological studies, apart from their value in population screenings and case-finding, have contributed to the new classification and diagnostic criteria for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and our understanding of risk factors and host characteristics in the aetiology of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
