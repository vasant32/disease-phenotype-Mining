<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to investigate the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi> on insulin sensitivity and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism, we enrolled 14 hypertensive patients under treatment with ARB other than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi> who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> [homeostasis model for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-IR)&gt;2.0] but no severe <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (HbA1c&lt;6.5%), and HOMA-IR was compared before and after the displacement by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also enrolled 27 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (body mass index&gt;25kg/m(2)) and hypertensive patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> under treatment with ARB other than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi>, and HbA1c was assessed before and after the displacement by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi> significantly improved HOMA-IR in hypertensive patients and also significantly decreased HbA1c in type 2 diabetic patients especially in the patients with poor glycemic control (HbA1c&gt;==8.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi> improves <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and gives beneficial effects in hypertensive patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and a poor glycemic control </plain></SENT>
