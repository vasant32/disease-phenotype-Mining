<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To study a new class of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> agents, we compared two small, nonpeptide molecules that activate insulin receptor (IR) beta-subunit tyrosine kinase activity: Merck L7, a direct IR <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, and Telik's TLK16998, an IR sensitizer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In rat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019204" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatoma</z:e> cells (HTCs) that overexpress the IR (HTC-IR), IR autophosphorylation was directly activated by L7 in the absence of insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TLK16998 did not directly activate IR autophosphorylation, but it enhanced IR autophosphorylation in the presence of insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tyrosine phosphorylation of an endogenous 185-kDa IR substrate was also significantly enhanced by both Merck L7 alone and TLK16998 plus insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adding TLK16998 to L7 produced synergistic effects, further indicating that these two compounds act on the IR through separate mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We next studied HTC-IR(Delta485-599) cells, which overexpress a mutant IR with a deletion in the alpha-subunit connecting domain that does not undergo autophosphorylation in response to insulin binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>L7 was able to directly activate autophosphorylation of the deletion mutant IR in these cells, whereas TLK16998 had no effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compounds were then tested in three other cell models of impaired IR function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both TLK16998 and Merck L7 improved IR autophosphorylation in cells with diminished IR signaling due to either treatment with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha or overexpression of membrane <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> PC-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> (tetradecanoylphorbol <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi>)-treated cells, TLK16998 but not Merck L7 was able to significantly reverse the impaired insulin-stimulated IR autophosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In summary, these two classes of IR activators selectively increased IR function in a variety of insulin-resistant cell lines </plain></SENT>
