<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> is prevalent in diabetic patients, but there is little information on the localization of nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs) within the plaque and their relationship with <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to characterize the NEFA composition and location in human diabetic atheroma plaques by metabolomic analysis and imaging and to address their relationship with <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) was used for metabolomic analysis imaging of frozen carotid atheroma plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Carotid endarterectomy specimens were used for conventional immunohistochemistry, laser-capture microdissection quantitative PCR, and in situ Southwestern hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Biological actions of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17351">linoleic acid</z:chebi> were studied in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TOF-SIMS imaging evidenced a significant increase in the quantity of several NEFA in diabetic versus nondiabetic atheroma plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Higher levels of NEFA were also found in diabetic sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of LPL <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in NEFA-rich areas of the atheroma plaque, as well as the lack of correlation between serum and plaque NEFA, suggests a local origin for plaque NEFA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The pattern of distribution of plaque NEFA is similar to that of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1, LPL, and activated NF-kappaB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Diabetic endarterectomy specimens showed higher numbers of infiltrating macrophages and T-lymphocytes-a finding that associated with higher NEFA levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Finally, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17351">linoleic acid</z:chebi> activates NF-kappaB and upregulates NF-kappaB-mediated LPL and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 expression in cultured VSMC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: There is an increased presence of NEFA in diabetic plaque neointima </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>NEFA levels are higher in diabetic atheroma plaques than in nondiabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that NEFA may be produced locally and contribute to local <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
