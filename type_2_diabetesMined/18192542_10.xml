<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A common variant in the UCP2 promoter (-866G&gt;A) modulates <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression, with increased expression associated with the A allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated association of this variant with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD) in two cohorts of type 2 diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 3,122 subjects from the 6-year prospective <z:mp ids='MP_0002057'>Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>Microalbuminuria</z:mp>, Cardiovascular Events, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8774">Ramipril</z:chebi> (DIABHYCAR) Study (14.9% of CAD incidence at follow-up) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An independent, hospital-based cohort of 335 men, 52% of whom had CAD, was also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We observed an inverse association of the A allele with incident cases of CAD in a dominant model (hazard risk 0.88 [95% CI 0.80-0.96]; P = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similar results were observed for baseline cases of CAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Stratification by sex confirmed an allelic association with CAD in men, whereas no association was observed in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> CAD phenotypes considered--<z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001681'>angina pectoris</z:hpo>, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo>--contributed significantly to the association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results were replicated in a cross-sectional study of an independent cohort (odds ratio 0.47 [95% CI 0.25-0.89]; P = 0.02 for a recessive model) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The A allele of the -866G&gt;A variant of UCP2 was associated with reduced risk of CAD in men with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a 6-year prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Decreased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001681'>angina pectoris</z:hpo>, CABG, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> contributed individually and significantly to the reduction of CAD risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This association was independent of other common CAD risk factors </plain></SENT>
