<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This inhibition is enhanced by the minor Q allele of the K121Q polymorphism (rs1044498) in the gene (ENPP1) encoding PC-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This polymorphism has been studied in relation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in several populations with conflicting results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We assessed the impact of the ENPP1 K121Q polymorphism on type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and quantitative metabolic traits in 7,333 Danes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The K121Q polymorphism was genotyped in the population-based Inter99 study cohort (5,961 subjects) and in a group of 1,386 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects were Danish whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No significant associations with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or related quantitative metabolic traits, including measures of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, a meta-analysis of the present and published studies revealed an association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (odds ratio per Q allele, 1.17 [95% CI 1.10-1.25], p=1x10(-6)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In case-control studies comparing subjects of different BMI strata, we observed a putative association of the codon 121 QQ genotype with being overweight (BMI&gt;25 kg/m(2); odds ratio 1.63 [95% CI 1.09-2.46], p=0.015), an association not observed when comparing other levels of BMI or when analysing BMI as a quantitative trait </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In a meta-analysis, the ENPP1 codon 121 Q allele associates with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, a similar association was not found in the present study of Danish white subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The effect of this variant on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in Danish subjects is contentious and further study is needed </plain></SENT>
