<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">Rosiglitazone</z:chebi> reduced the blood levels of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, and free fatty acids; enhanced cardiac <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> oxidation; and increased Akt phosphorylation (Akt-pS473) 2.1-fold and Akt kinase activity 1.8-fold in the ischemic myocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The phosphorylation of two downstream targets of Akt, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase kinase-3beta and FKHR (forkhead transcription factor), was also enhanced by 2- and 2.9-fold, respectively </plain></SENT>
