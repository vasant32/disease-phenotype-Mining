<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether spouses of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have an increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with spouses of subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A random sample of spouses of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (group 1S) attending a general practice <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> clinic was compared with spouses of nondiabetic subjects (as determined by oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test [OGTT]) (group 2S) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Spouses in both groups underwent OGTT, fasting <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile, and blood pressure (BP) measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 245 subjects in group 1S and 234 subjects in group 2S underwent OGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Group 1S had a significantly higher incidence of fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo>, or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (19.1 vs. 9.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Group 1S also had higher fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels, higher BMI, and a trend toward higher BP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression analysis, adjusted for BMI and age, showed the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the spouse of a patient with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 2.11 (95% CI 1.74-5.1), as compared with the spouse of a subject with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the risk of any degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> in a spouse of a patient with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 2.32 (1.87-3.98), as compared with a spouse of a subject with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Spouses of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have a significantly increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and they should be classified as high risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This finding has implications for screening programs, which should include spouses of subjects with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
