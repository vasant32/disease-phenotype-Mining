<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first stage consisted of a questionnaire which was mailed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> dialysis centres in mainland France </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The response rate was 80.8%, resulting in a study population of 12,903 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these patients 884 were declared diabetic (6.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Later 295 of them were interviewed by seven specially-trained physicians who checked the medical records together with the nephrologist in charge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> was measured in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Effectively, 1.4% were found to have Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 5.5%, Type 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> was found to be the only primary renal diagnosis among 93.9% of Type 1 diabetic patients and 36.8% of Type 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the latter 51.6% had a non-diabetic cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the second stage a survey was later conducted in 13 of 14 dialysis centres located in the remote overseas French territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among 934 patients 1.04% were Type 1 diabetic and 19.67% Type 2 (22.9% altogether) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Type 2 diabetic patients treated overseas were essentially non-Caucasians (92.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The sex ratio was 0.54 in the overseas territories vs 1.4 in the mainland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among people on dialysis is low in mainland France </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>But there are striking differences in the prevalence of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among dialysis patients in mainland France and its overseas territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These differences are not related to access to dialysis facilities </plain></SENT>
