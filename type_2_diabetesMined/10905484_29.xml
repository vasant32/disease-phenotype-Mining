<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies have suggested that TZD-induced activation of PPAR-gamma correlates with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> action, but the mechanism by which the activated PPAR-gamma is involved in reducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To examine whether activation of PPAR-gamma directly correlates with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> activities, we compared the effects of 4 TZDs (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">BRL-49653</z:chebi>, and a new derivative, NC-2100) on the activation of PPAR-gamma in a reporter assay, transcription of the target genes, adipogenesis, plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels, and body weight using <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> KKAy mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 10- to 30-fold higher concentrations of NC-2100 required for maximal activation of PPAR-gamma in a reporter assay system, and only high concentrations of NC-2100 weakly induced transcription of the PPAR-gamma but not PPAR-alpha target genes in a whole mouse and adipogenesis of cultured 3T3L1 cells, which indicates that NC-2100 is a weak PPAR-gamma activator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, low concentrations of NC-2100 efficiently lowered plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels in KKAy <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results strongly suggest that TZD-induced activation of PPAR-gamma does not directly correlate with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering) action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, NC-2100 caused the smallest body weight increase of the 4 TZDs, which may be partly explained by the finding that NC-2100 efficiently induces uncoupling protein (UCP)-2 mRNA and significantly induces UCP1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in white adipose tissue (WAT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NC-2100 induced UCP1 efficiently in mesenteric WAT and less efficiently in subcutaneous WAT, although <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> also slightly induced UCP1 only in mesenteric WAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These characteristics of NC-2100 should be beneficial for humans with limited amounts of brown adipose tissue </plain></SENT>
