<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of these 1,033 dialysis patients 140 were the result of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From four hospitals affiliated to Shiga University of Medical Science the medical records of 90 diabetic subjects on dialysis therapy were reviewed and various clinical parameters were analysed and compared with those of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000099'>glomerulonephritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since only one patient had Type 1 (insulin-dependent) <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the remaining 89 with Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were used for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The significantly different variables between patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000099'>glomerulonephritis</z:hpo> were age (60.4 vs 54.6 years, p &lt; 0.05), BMI (22.4 vs 20.6 kg/m2, p &lt; 0.001), cardiothoracic ratio (56.4 vs 53.3%, p &lt; 0.001), mean blood pressure (110 vs 117 mmHg, p &lt; 0.05), serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> (9.0 vs 11.5 mg/dl, p &lt; 0.001), serum <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi>-N (98.2 vs 115.5 mg/dl, p &lt; 0.001), serum total protein (6.0 vs 6.5 g/dl, p &lt; 0.001) and serum albumin (3.5 vs. 3.9 g/dl, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> were not significantly different between two groups, though the prevalence of electrocardiogram abnormalities, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and cerebrovascular diseases was significantly higher in the Type 2 diabetic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that Type 2 diabetic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal disease</z:hpo> were older, more malnourished, fluid overloaded and multi-morbid as a result of vasculopathy and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
