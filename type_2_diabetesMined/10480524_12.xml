<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We measured blood flow using laser Doppler techniques in 10 people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 10 age- and BMI-matched healthy control subjects at the pulp of the index finger (glabrous skin) and the dorsum of the hand (hairy skin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 5-min ischemic block of the arm was used to test vascular endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Warming of the probe site to 45 degrees C tested neurogenic vasodilation in hairy skin only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vessel distensibility was tested by gravitational pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Basal blood flow and reactive hyperemia did not differ between groups at either skin site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The vasodilative response to local warming (P &lt; 0.01) and limb lowering (P &lt; 0.05) were significantly different between groups in hairy skin but not in glabrous skin in the absence of objective measured <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nociceptor-mediated flow correlated significantly with the warm thermal threshold (r = -0.50, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Endothelial-mediated blood flow correlated with systolic blood pressure (r = -0.76, P &lt; 0.01), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (r = -0.62, P &lt; 0.001), C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (r = 0.65, P &lt; 0.05), and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (r = 0.47, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that neurogenic nociceptor-mediated vasodilation is impaired in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> when endothelial and sympathetic function are relatively intact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Heat-induced vasodilation may be a specific test of small heat-sensitive C-fiber peripheral neurons and may be an integral part of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
