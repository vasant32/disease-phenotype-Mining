<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This linkage appears to be mediated by altered beta-cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to study underlying mechanisms, we examined the effect of four KCNQ1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on insulin secretion upon different stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We genotyped 1,578 nondiabetic subjects at increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for rs151290, rs2237892, rs2237895, and rs2237897 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants underwent an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT); glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (GLP)-1 and gastric inhibitory <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> secretion was measured in 170 participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 519 participants, a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp was performed, in 314 participants an intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (IVGTT), and in 102 subjects a hyperglycemic clamp combined with GLP-1 and arginine stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: rs151290 was nominally associated with 30-min C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels during OGTT, first-phase insulin secretion, and insulinogenic index after adjustment in the dominant model (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; or = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>rs2237892, rs2237895, and rs2237897 were nominally associated with OGTT-derived insulin secretion indexes (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No SNPs were associated with beta-cell function during intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> or GLP-1 administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, rs151290 was associated with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated gastric inhibitory <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> and GLP-1 increase after adjustment in the dominant model (P = 0.0042 and P = 0.0198, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No associations were detected between the other SNPs and basal or stimulated incretin levels (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &gt; or = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Common genetic variation in KCNQ1 is associated with insulin secretion upon oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> load in a German population at increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The discrepancy between orally and intravenously administered <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> seems to be explained not by altered incretin signaling but most likely by changes in incretin secretion </plain></SENT>
