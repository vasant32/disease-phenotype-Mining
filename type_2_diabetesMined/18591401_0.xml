<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 426 subjects (51 +/- 9 years, BMI 24.6 +/- 3.9 kg/m(2)) with newly diagnosed IGT were randomly assigned to three groups, 143 as the short-term hospitalization with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> education and support (STH) group, 141 as the nonhospitalization but <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> education and support (DES) group, and 142 as the neither hospitalization nor education (control) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The average follow-up was 3.1 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 8.0, 10.7, and 13.2 cases per 100 person-years for STH, DES, and control groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 42% lower (95% CI 33-51%) in the STH group and 27% lower (15-37%) in the DES group than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 21% lower (10-31%) in the STH group than in the DES group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The 2-day in-hospital program with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> education and support every 3 months was more effective in preventing or delaying the progression from IGT to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than only <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> education and support every 3 months </plain></SENT>
