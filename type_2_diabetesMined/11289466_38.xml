<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Although clinically evident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is a well-established cause of mortality, less is known about subclinical states of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data from the Second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Mortality Study, a prospective study of adults, were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This analysis focused on a nationally representative sample of 3,174 adults aged 30-75 years who underwent an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test at baseline (1976-1980) and who were followed up for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> through 1992 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Using 1985 World Health Organization criteria, adults were classified as having previously diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 248), undiagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 183), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) (n = 480), or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (n = 2,263) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For these groups, cumulative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality through age 70 was 41, 34, 27, and 20%, respectively (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, the multivariate adjusted RR of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality was greatest for adults with diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (RR 2.11, 95% CI 1.56-2.84), followed by those with undiagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (1.77, 1.13-2.75) and those with IGT (1.42, 1.08-1.87; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A similar pattern of risk was observed for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the U.S., there was a gradient of mortality associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001952'>abnormal glucose tolerance</z:hpo> ranging from a 40% greater risk in adults with IGT to a 110% greater risk in adults with clinically evident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These associations were independent of established <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> risk factors </plain></SENT>
