<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate once- and twice-daily self-monitored blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> testing strategies in assessing glycemic control and detecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> in patients with stable insulin-treated type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Subjects with stable insulin-treated type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> monitored blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> four times daily (prebreakfast, prelunch, predinner, and bedtime) for 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We correlated mean blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> values with HbA(1c) measured after 8 weeks and determined the number of hypoglycemic (&lt; or =3.33 mmol/l) and hyperglycemic (&gt; or =22.20 mmol/l) readings captured at the various testing times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 150 subjects completed the monitoring period; their average age was 67 years, 90% were men, and the mean HbA(1c) at baseline was 8.0 +/- 1.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall correlation of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> testing and HbA(1c) was 0.79 (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> values for each of the four once-daily testing strategies were significantly correlated with HbA(1c) (r = 0.65-0.70, P &lt; 0.0001), as were mean blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> values for each of the six twice-daily testing strategies (r = 0.73-0.75, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prebreakfast/prelunch measurements captured the largest proportion (63.6%) of the hypoglycemic readings, the predinner/bedtime measurements captured the largest proportion (66.2%) of hyperglycemic readings, and the prelunch/predinner measurements captured the largest proportion (57.7%) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> out-of-range readings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Twice-daily testing strategies, particularly prelunch/predinner, effectively assess glycemic control and capture a substantial proportion of out-of-range readings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, personal testing strategies will vary depending on an individual's risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
