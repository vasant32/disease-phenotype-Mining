<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have now assessed the prevalence of enteroviral capsid protein vp1 (vp1) staining in a large cohort of autopsy pancreases of recent-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 1 diabetic patients and a range of controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serial sections of paraffin-embedded pancreatic autopsy samples from 72 recent-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients and up to 161 controls were immunostained for insulin, glucagon, vp1, double-stranded <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> activated protein kinase R (PKR) and MHC class I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: vp1-immunopositive cells were detected in multiple islets of 44 out of 72 young recent-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 1 diabetic patients, compared with a total of only three islets in three out of 50 neonatal and paediatric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>vp1 staining was restricted to insulin-containing beta cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the control pancreases, vp1 immunopositivity was also observed in some islets from ten out of 25 type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A strong correlation was established between islet cell vp1 positivity and PKR production in insulin-containing islets of both type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients, consistent with a persistent <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> of the islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Immunoreactive vp1 is commonly found in the islets of recent-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients, but only rarely in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> paediatric controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>vp1 immunostaining was also observed in some islets of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients, suggesting that the phenomenon is not restricted to type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
