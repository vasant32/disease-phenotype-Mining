<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since inadequate sample size is likely to have been an obstacle to reliable inference, we examined the relationship between VNTR variation and a range of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related traits in a cohort of 5,753 Finnish adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: VNTR genotypes were derived, by typing at the -23HphI variant site, for 5,646 individuals from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Associations were sought between these genotypes and a range of anthropometric (BMI, WHR), physiological (blood pressure) and biochemical (fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, indices of insulin sensitivity and beta cell function) measures obtained at clinical examination at 31 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found no evidence that VNTR genotype was significantly associated with measures of insulin secretion, insulin sensitivity, glycaemia, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> or blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Despite evidence from several relatively small studies suggesting that INS-VNTR genotypes are associated with predisposition to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, reduced beta cell function and measures of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e>, the present study failed to detect any association with a range of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Taken with other recent studies in large population-based cohorts, these data suggest that previous studies have, at the very least, overestimated the influence of the INS-VNTR on type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The effects of INS-VNTR variation on insulin transcription observed in vitro appear not to translate into detectable differences in basal insulin secretion in humans </plain></SENT>
