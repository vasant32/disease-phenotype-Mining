<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) is a growth and differentiation factor for mature beta-cells and their precursors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the overall effect of GLP-1 on increasing beta-cell mass in both in vivo and in vitro conditions is relatively small, and augmenting this effect would be beneficial for the treatment or prevention of type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we searched for cellular mechanisms that may limit the proliferative effect of GLP-1 and tested whether blocking them could increase beta-cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We examined GLP-1-regulated genes in beta TC-Tet cells by cDNA microarrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To assess the effect of some of these gene on cell proliferation, we reduced their expression using small heterogenous <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> in beta-cell lines and primary mouse islets and measured [(3)H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> or 5'-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="22927,47265">bromo</z:chebi>-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified four negative regulators of intracellular signaling that were rapidly and strongly activated by GLP-1: the regulator of G-protein-signaling RGS2; the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> cAMP response element modulator (CREM)-alpha and ICERI; and the dual specificity phosphatase DUSP14, a negative regulator of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We show that knockdown of CREMalpha or DUSP14 or expression of a dominant-negative form of DUSP14 increased beta-cell line proliferation and enhanced the GLP-1-induced proliferation of primary beta-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Together, our data show that 1) the cAMP/protein kinase A/CREB and MAPK/ERK1/2 pathways can additively control beta-cell proliferation, 2) beta-cells have evolved several mechanisms limiting GLP-1-induced cellular proliferation, and 3) blocking these mechanisms increases the positive effect of GLP-1 on beta-cell mass </plain></SENT>
