<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Self-monitoring of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (SMBG) provides the possibility for collecting information on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels at different timepoints and facilitates patient empowerment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the efficacy of SMBG in particular groups of patients is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Self-monitoring is postulated to have a beneficial effect on metabolic control in type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> as it is essential to adjust insulin doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> the efficacy of frequent <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> measurements remains uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this paper is to overview recent data in the field of self-control to evaluate the influence of SMBG on glycaemic control in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results of studies suggest that SMBG can have an important role in improving metabolic control if it is an integral part of a wider educational strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SMBG can be especially recommended for type 2 diabetic patients with suboptimal metabolic control in order to promote dietary and lifestyle changes as well as treatment correction as a response to feedback provided by blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> results </plain></SENT>
