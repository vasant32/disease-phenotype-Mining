<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the 2-year pulmonary safety of inhaled human insulin (Exubera [EXU]) in 635 nonsmoking adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive prandial EXU or subcutaneous insulin (regular or short-acting) plus basal (intermediate- or long-acting) insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary end points were the annual rate of decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) and <z:chebi fb="168" ids="17245">carbon monoxide</z:chebi> diffusing capacity (DL(CO)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Small differences in FEV(1) favoring subcutaneous insulin developed during the first 3 months but did not progress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adjusted treatment group differences in FEV(1) annual rate of change were -0.007 l/year (90% CI -0.021 to 0.006) between months 0 and 24 and 0.000 l/year (-0.016 to 0.016) during months 3-24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment group differences in DL(CO) annual rate of change were not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both groups sustained similar reductions in A1C by month 24 (last observation carried forward) (EXU 7.7-7.3% vs. subcutaneous insulin 7.8-7.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reductions in fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) were greater with EXU than with subcutaneous insulin (adjusted mean treatment difference -12.4 mg/dl [90% CI -19.7 to -5.0]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> was comparable in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Weight increased less with EXU than with subcutaneous insulin (-1.3 kg [-1.9 to -0.7]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Adverse events were comparable, except for a higher incidence of mild cough and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> with EXU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Two-year prandial EXU therapy showed a small <z:hpo ids='HP_0003680'>nonprogressive</z:hpo> difference in FEV(1) and comparable sustained A1C improvement but lower FPG levels and less <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> than seen in association with subcutaneous insulin in adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
