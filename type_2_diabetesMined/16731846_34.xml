<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A disturbed balance between coagulation and fibrinolysis has been implicated in the pathogenesis hereof </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine the selective effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> on coagulation and fibrinolysis, six healthy humans were studied on four occasions for 6 h: 1) lower insulinemic-euglycemic clamp, 2) lower insulinemic-hyperglycemic clamp, 3) hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, and 4) hyperinsulinemic-hyperglycemic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the hyperglycemic clamps, target levels of plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> were 12 versus 5 mmol/l in the normoglycemic clamps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the hyperinsulinemic clamps, target plasma insulin levels were 400 versus 100 pmol/l in the lower insulinemic clamps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>Hyperglycemia</z:hpo> exerted a procoagulant effect irrespective of insulin levels, as reflected by mean twofold rises in thrombin-antithrombin complexes and soluble tissue factor, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> inhibited fibrinolysis irrespective of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, as reflected by a decrease in plasminogen activator activity levels due to a mean 2.5-fold rise in plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The differential effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> suggest that patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> are especially susceptible to thrombotic events by a concurrent insulin-driven impairment of fibrinolysis and a <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-driven activation of coagulation </plain></SENT>
