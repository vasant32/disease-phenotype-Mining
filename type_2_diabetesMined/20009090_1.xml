<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Patients (n = 368; A1C &gt; or =7%) were randomized to 20 mg/day rimonabant or placebo in this 48-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Change in baseline A1C to week 48 (primary outcome) and changes in body weight, waist circumference, and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels (secondary outcomes) were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS Rimonabant significantly reduced baseline A1C versus placebo (-0.89 vs. -0.24%; P &lt; 0.0001), and significantly greater improvements were observed in cardiometabolic risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>More rimonabant patients achieved &gt;10% reduction in mean total daily insulin dose versus placebo (P = 0.0012), and fewer required rescue medication (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>Hypoglycemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, dizziness, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> were more frequent with rimonabant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS Rimonabant improved glycemic control and cardiometabolic risk factors in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> receiving insulin </plain></SENT>
