<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Insulin analogues are widely used but few data exist comparing different analogue regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared two such regimens in type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) uncontrolled by oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> agents (OADs) with or without basal insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a 26-week multinational, multicentre, randomized treat-to-target trial, OADs were discontinued and subjects randomized to analogue basal-bolus therapy (insulin detemir once daily and insulin aspart mealtimes) or biphasic insulin aspart 30 (30% rapid-acting insulin aspart), twice daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Insulin was titrated to targets for fasting, predinner and postprandial plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (PG), as appropriate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 719 subjects, 92% completed the study; 58% achieved <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> fraction A(1c) (HbA(1c)) &lt; or =7.0%, with reductions of 1.56% (to 6.96%) with basal-bolus therapy and 1.23% (to 7.17%) with biphasic insulin aspart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reduction with basal-bolus therapy was superior in the overall population by 0.23% (p = 0.0052), with no difference between regimens in insulin-naive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> occurred in five basal-bolus patients (0.9%) and in no patients with biphasic insulin aspart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Incidence of minor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> was similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> insulin doses increased during titration, with increase in lunchtime insulin aspart dose and equal distribution of breakfast and dinner biphasic insulin aspart doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Insulin detemir remained once daily in 87% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Modern insulin analogue regimens, adjusted to PG targets, enable a majority of people with T2DM to reach HbA(1c)&lt; or =7.0% after failure of OADs and OAD-basal insulin therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Insulin-treated patients may benefit more from transfer to analogue basal-bolus therapy, while insulin-naive individuals benefit equally well from the more convenient biphasic analogue regimen </plain></SENT>
