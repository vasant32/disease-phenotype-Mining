<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because tachyphylaxis may develop with continuous <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> exposure, we examined the activity of a long-acting-release (LAR) formulation of exenatide on HbA1c, insulin sensitivity and beta cell secretion in ZDF rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Single subcutaneous injections of a poly-lactide-glycolide microsphere suspension (3% <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>) containing 0, 1, 10, 100, 1,000, 3,000 or 9,000 mug exenatide were administered to 9-week-old ZDF rats with matched initial HbA1c values (n=7 rats/group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In contrast to the progressive 3.22+/-0.42% increase in HbA1c in control ZDF rats observed over 28 days, single exenatide-LAR injections dose-proportionally prevented such glycaemic deterioration (median effective dose 74 microg+/-0.1 log per rat; median effective concentration 52 pmol/l+/-0.06 log) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp procedures incorporating an intraclamp <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> challenge performed 28 days after treatment revealed increases in beta cell response to the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> challenge at lower exenatide-LAR doses, and up to a 2.1-fold increase in insulin sensitivity at higher exenatide-LAR doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The finding that a single dose of exenatide-LAR enhanced <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control for 28 days in the ZDF rat model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> suggests that tachyphylaxis is unlikely to be a feature of exenatide-LAR preparations, and supports further clinical exploration </plain></SENT>
