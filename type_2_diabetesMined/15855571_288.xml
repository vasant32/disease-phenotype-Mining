<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A 30-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was performed in 733 subjects (aged 55 +/- 10 years, BMI 33.6 +/- 5.7 kg/m(2), A1C 8.5 +/- 1.0%; means +/- SD) randomized to 5 microg subcutaneous exenatide b.i.d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>(arms A and B) or placebo for 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, arm A remained at 5 microg b.i.d. and arm B escalated to 10 microg b.i.d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects continued taking their dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and were randomized to either maximally effective (MAX) or minimum recommended (MIN) doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Week 30 A1C changes from baseline (+/-SE) were -0.8 +/- 0.1% (10 microg), -0.6 +/- 0.1% (5 microg), and +0.2 +/- 0.1% (placebo; adjusted P &lt; 0.0001 vs. placebo), yielding placebo-adjusted reductions of -1.0% (10 microg) and -0.8% (5 microg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the evaluable population, exenatide-treated subjects were more likely to achieve A1C &lt; or =7% than placebo-treated subjects (34% [10 microg], 27% [5 microg], and 9% [placebo]; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both exenatide arms demonstrated significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> (-1.6 +/- 0.2 kg from baseline each exenatide arm, -0.9 +/- 0.2 kg placebo; P &lt; or = 0.01 vs. placebo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mild or moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> was the most frequent adverse event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence of mild/moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> was 28% (10 microg), 19% (5 microg), and 13% (placebo) and appeared lower with MIN than with MAX <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Exenatide significantly reduced A1C in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> unable to achieve adequate glycemic control with maximally effective doses of combined <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This improvement in glycemic control was associated with no <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> and was generally well tolerated </plain></SENT>
