<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study sought to determine the agreement between two common testing devices and to determine whether these are concordant in their association with predictor variables for diabetic sensory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001271'>polyneuropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 83 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (10 patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 73 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) and a wide spectrum of diabetic sensory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001271'>polyneuropathy</z:hpo> severity underwent concurrent cooling detection threshold testing using the Medoc and CASE IV instruments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Common predictor variables for diabetic sensory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001271'>polyneuropathy</z:hpo> were measured on the same day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Measurements of cooling detection thresholds by both instruments were highly correlated (Spearman's correlation coefficient 0.81, P &lt; 0.001) and demonstrated a high degree of agreement by the method of Bland and Altman (95% distribution critical values for the difference in cooling detection thresholds, +7.5 and -5.6 degrees C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cooling detection thresholds by both instruments were strongly correlated with clinical indicators of large-fiber <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> but not with the symptoms of small-fiber <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> (pain) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These two instruments available for assessment of cooling detection thresholds are interchangeable for research in diabetic sensory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001271'>polyneuropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, this modality is equivalent to other modalities of quantitative sensory threshold testing in its association with indicators of large-fiber <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> and does not seem to provide an advantage for the prediction of small-fiber involvement </plain></SENT>
