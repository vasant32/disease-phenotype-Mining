<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Laboratory models suggest that IGF-I and its binding proteins IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-2 have potentially beneficial effects on <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk, whereas IGFBP-3 may have adverse effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore conducted a prospective nested case-control investigation of incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 742 case subjects matched 1:1 to control subjects) and its associations with IGF-axis protein levels in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort of middle-aged women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median time to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Statistical analyses were adjusted for multiple risk factors, including insulin and C-reactive protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> risk was fivefold lower among women with baseline IGFBP-2 levels in the top versus bottom quintile (odds ratio [OR](q5-q1) = 0.17 [95% CI 0.08-0.35]; P trend &lt; 0.0001) and was also negatively associated with IGFBP-1 levels (OR(q5-q1) = 0.37 [0.18-0.73]; P trend = 0.0009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IGFBP-3 was positively associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (OR(q5-q1) = 2.05 [1.20-3.51]; P trend = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> was not associated with total IGF-I levels, but free IGF-I and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had a significant association that varied (P interaction = 0.003) by insulin levels above the median (OR(q5-q1) = 0.48 [0.26-0.90]; P trend = 0.0001) versus below the median (OR(q5-q1) = 2.52 [1.05-6.06]; P trend &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, this prospective study found strong associations of incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with baseline levels of three IGFBPs and free IGF-I, consistent with hypotheses that the IGF axis might influence <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
