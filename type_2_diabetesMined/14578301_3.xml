<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have reported a high incidence of postoperative unfavorable cardiac-related events in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Structural and functional characteristics of CABG conduits, which have been shown to play an important role in patient outcome after myocardial revascularization, have not been fully investigated in diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we sought to determine the influence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult-onset</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on vasoreactivity and morphological profile of venous and arterial grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 160 consecutive patients enrolled in the study, 90 were diagnosed with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 70 did not have <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent evaluation of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control before surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Tissue specimens were collected from left internal thoracic artery (LITA) and saphenous vein (SV) grafts harvested during elective CABG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Functional tests were performed to assess contractile and vasodilative responses of bypass conduits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histological evaluation was carried out to examine vessel wall structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to correlate the preoperative factors related to the control of the <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> disorder with histological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patient medical history and demographics did not differ between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Diabetic patients showed significant <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> and higher plasma levels of C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> and GHb as compared with nondiabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Functional tests of the LITA segments revealed no difference between groups with regard to contractile and vasodilative responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In contrast, significant impairment in the endothelium-related vasodilation of the SV grafts was observed in diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Histological studies showed structural preservation of the arterial conduits in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, marked intimal abnormalities (also atherosclerotic calcified plaques) were detected in SV grafts harvested from diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis showed that high levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> and GHb were independent predictors of advanced structural degeneration of SV conduits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Treatment modality, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and other demographic or metabolic factors were found to have no influence on the morphological characteristics of SV conduits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, biological properties of LITA conduits for CABG were preserved in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>However, these patients frequently showed impairment of the endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation and intimal degeneration of SV grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The extent of structural abnormalities of SV grafts was inversely correlated with the efficacy of the metabolic control of the <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Further studies are required to conclusively correlate preoperative SV graft abnormalities with postoperative conduit patency rate and the occurrence of adverse cardiac-related events in diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
