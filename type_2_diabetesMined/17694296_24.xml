<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Traits were measured in 240 monozygotic (MZ) and 138 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs aged 18 to 34 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twins were recruited from the Belgian population-based East Flanders Prospective Twin Survey, which is characterised by its accurate zygosity determination and extensive collection of perinatal and placental data, including information on chorionicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Heritability was estimated using structural equation modelling implemented in the Mx software package </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Intra-pair correlations of the anthropometric and metabolic characteristics did not differ between MZ monochorionic and MZ dichorionic pairs; consequently heritabilities were estimated using the classical twin approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For body mass, BMI and fat mass, quantitative sex differences were observed; genetic variance explained 84, 85 and 81% of the total variation in men and 74, 75 and 70% in women, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Heritability estimates of the waist-to-hip ratio, sum of four skinfold thicknesses and lean body mass were 70, 74 and 81%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The heritability estimates of fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, fasting insulin, homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and beta cell function, as well as insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 levels were 67, 49, 48, 62 and 47%, in that order </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, for total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL-cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi>, total cholesterol:<z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> ratio, triacylglycerol, NEFA and leptin levels, genetic factors explained 75, 78, 76, 79, 58, 37 and 53% of the total variation, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Genetic factors explain the greater part of the variation in traits related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
