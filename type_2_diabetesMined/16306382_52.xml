<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It causes recurrent morbidity, and sometimes <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, as well as a vicious cycle of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001988'>recurrent hypoglycemia</z:hpo>, precluding maintenance of euglycemia over a lifetime of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Improved therapeutic approaches that will minimize both hypo- and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> will be based on insight into the pathophysiology of glucoregulation, specifically <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> counterregulation, in insulin-deficient (type 1 and advanced type 2) <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In such patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> is the result of the interplay of relative or absolute therapeutic insulin excess and compromised physiological (the syndrome of defective <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> counterregulation) and behavioral (the syndrome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> unawareness) defenses against falling plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The concept of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393911" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autonomic failure</z:e> (HAAF) in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> posits that recent antecedent iatrogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> causes both defective <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> counterregulation (by reducing <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi> responses to a given level of subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> in the setting of absent decrements in insulin and absent increments in glucagon) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> unawareness (by reducing sympathoadrenal and the resulting neurogenic symptom responses to a given level of subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>) and thus a vicious cycle of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001988'>recurrent hypoglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical impact of HAAF is well established in type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; it also affects those with advanced type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is now known to be largely reversible, by as little as 2-3 weeks of scrupulous avoidance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>, in most affected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanisms of HAAF and its component syndromes are largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Loss of the glucagon secretory response, a key feature of defective <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> counterregulation, is plausibly explained by insulin deficiency, specifically loss of the decrement in intraislet insulin that normally signals glucagon secretion as <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels fall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reduced neurogenic symptoms, a key feature of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> unawareness, are largely the result of reduced sympathetic neural responses to falling <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mechanism by which <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> shifts the glycemic thresholds for sympathoadrenal activation to lower plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations, the key feature of both components of HAAF, is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It does not appear to be the result of the release of a systemic mediator (e.g., <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi>) during antecedent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> or of increased blood-to-brain <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transport (although increased transport of alternative fuels is conceivable) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is likely the result of alterations of brain metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although there is an array of clues, the specific alteration remains to be identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>While the research focus has been largely on the hypothalamus, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> is now known to activate widespread brain regions, including the medial prefrontal cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The possibility that HAAF could be the result of posthypoglycemic brain <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> supercompensation has also been raised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Finally, there appear to be diverse causes of HAAF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In addition to recent antecedent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>, these include exercise- and sleep-related HAAF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Clearly, a unifying mechanism of HAAF would need to incorporate these causes as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Pending the prevention and cure of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, critical fundamental, translational, and outcomes research is needed if we are to eliminate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> from the lives of people affected by <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
