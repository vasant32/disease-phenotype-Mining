<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent cross-sectional and prospective studies suggest an inverse association of serum TRAIL levels with the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD) and with an adverse outcome in patients with CAD or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it is unknown whether TRAIL can inversely reflect the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> from its early stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We therefore examined the association between TRAIL measured by ELISA and intima-media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) in carotid and femoral arteries evaluated by ultrasonography as a surrogate marker of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in 416 type 2 diabetic patients without any symptoms of CAD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Concurrently, the existence of calcified plaque (CP) was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no significant association between TRAIL and carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> (ρ=-0.096, p=0.052) or femoral <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> (ρ=-0.025, p=0.610), although TRAIL was associated with carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> in a subset of patients with macrovascular diseases (ρ=-0.174, p=0.034) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No difference in TRAIL levels was found between two groups with or without CP </plain></SENT>
