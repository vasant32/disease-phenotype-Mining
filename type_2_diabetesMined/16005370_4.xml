<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fasting plasma C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (FCP) and glucagon-stimulated C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (GSCP) levels were measured in 116 Nigerians with T2DM at a university teaching hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After 9 months of follow-up and treatment, they were categorized into three groups based on response to treatment: (A) good control but not on maximum sulphonylurea (SU) therapy, (B) inadequate control but not on maximum SU therapy and (C) on maximum SU therapy+/-insulin or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3095">biguanide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression models were used to investigate how well C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels predicted the subjects belonging to Group C who are likely to require insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean FCP and mean GSCP levels of Group C were significantly lower than in the other groups (p=0.024; p= &lt;0.001 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A GSCP cut-off value of &lt; or =1.3 ng/mL predicted membership of Group C with 85% sensitivity and 89% specificity while a cut-off of &lt; or =1.8 ng/mL was associated with 91% sensitivity and 66% specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In resource-poor settings where inadequate treatment are common, estimation of GSCP may be useful in predicting treatment response and should be weighed against the cost of inadequate therapy with higher morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
