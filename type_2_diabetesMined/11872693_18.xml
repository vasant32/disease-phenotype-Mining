<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Resistin antagonizes insulin and could account for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine whether there are single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the resistin gene associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, sequences for 24 Japanese type 2 diabetic patients were initially analyzed using PCR direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three SNPs were found in the introns, but none were present in the coding regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The allele frequencies of genomic -167C&gt;T, +157C&gt;T, and +299G&gt;A in 99 Japanese control subjects were determined to be 3.5, 6.6, and 39.4%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In each pair of these SNPs, linkage disequilibria were found between either -167C&gt;T and +299G&gt;A or +157C&gt;T and +299G&gt;A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A linkage disequilibrium was also detected among -167C&gt;T, +157C&gt;T, and +299G&gt;A, and only four of the eight possible haplotypes defined by these SNPs were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A comparison of the frequencies of these SNPs and haplotypes between 99 type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 99 control subjects revealed no evidence for any association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These identified SNPs, which were in linkage disequilibrium, represent potentially useful tools for searching for their association with specific phenotypes of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
