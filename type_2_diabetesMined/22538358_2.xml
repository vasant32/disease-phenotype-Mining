<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the expression and function of the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> signalling system components in human pancreatic islets from normoglycaemic and type 2 diabetic individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Expression of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> signalling system components was studied by microarray, quantitative PCR analysis, immunohistochemistry and patch-clamp experiments on cells in intact islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hormone release was measured from intact islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> signalling system was compromised in islets from type 2 diabetic individuals, where the expression of the genes encoding the α1, α2, β2 and β3 GABA(A) channel subunits was downregulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> originating within the islets evoked tonic currents in the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The currents were enhanced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> and inhibited by the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>(A) receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, SR95531 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The effects of SR95531 on hormone release revealed that activation of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>(A) channels (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>(A) receptors) decreased both insulin and glucagon secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>(B) receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, CPG55845, increased insulin release in islets (16.7 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>) from normoglycaemic and type 2 diabetic individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Interstitial <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> activates <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>(A) channels and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>(B) receptors and effectively modulates hormone release in islets from type 2 diabetic and normoglycaemic individuals </plain></SENT>
