<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 211 diabetic patients were enrolled and followed up for 1 year at Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were provided comprehensive care and their medications were not changed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical and biophysical variables were collected and assessed at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Metabolic control had improved significantly by 1 year: fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (164.6+/-60.4 vs. 137+/-37.5mg/dl, p&lt;0.001); total serum cholesterol (198.7+/-38.8 vs. 187.2+/-43.1mg/dl, p&lt;0.001); <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoproteins cholesterol</z:chebi> (43.2+/-10.2 vs. 46.2+/-11.7 mg/dl, p&lt;0.001); <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoproteins cholesterol</z:chebi> (121.1+/-32.9 vs. 113.1+/-29.6 mg/dl, p&lt;0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the male group, HbA1c level fell from 8.16+/-1.99% to 7.61+/-1.31% and 7.72+/-1.40% after 9 months and 1 year, respectively, p&lt;0.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were also significant improvements in female group after 6 months and 9 months (7.89+/-1.62% after 6 months; 7.94+/-1.66% after 9 months vs. 8.22+/-1.70% at baseline) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The change of HbA1c level was significant in male patients, patients whose duration of disease was shorter and in those with higher baseline HbA1c levels after multi-variable and age-adjusted analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The comprehensive <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care program effectively improved glycemic and cholesterol control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The patients who were more likely to achieve better glycemic control were male, had <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for shorter periods of time and had high baseline HbA1c levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, diabetic education should be offered to patients as close to the time of diagnosis as possible </plain></SENT>
