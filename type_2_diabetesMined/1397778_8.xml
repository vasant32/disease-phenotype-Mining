<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of these studies was to determine whether subjects with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sensitivity (compared with age- and weight-matched non-diabetic subjects) to <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> infusion (60 ng.kg-1.min-1 for 60 min) and to compare the responses with oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15760">tyramine</z:chebi> administration (800 mg), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038443" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychological stress</z:e> (using competitive computer games) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">Noradrenaline</z:chebi> infusion caused significantly greater plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (mean increment 2.1 +/- 0.4 vs 0.6 +/- 0.1 mmol/l, p less than 0.005) and pressor responses (mean systolic increment 21 +/- 3 vs 11 +/- 1 mmHg, p less than 0.02) in the diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The excessive glycaemia was due to increased hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> output rather than reduced <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="15760">Tyramine</z:chebi> administration caused significantly increased hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> output and plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, but with similar responses in the diabetic and non-diabetic subjects; the pulse and pressor responses were also similar between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The psychological stressor induced significant increases in pulse, blood pressure and non-esterified fatty acid levels in the combined group of subjects (p less than 0.01) but did not influence plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels in either diabetic or non-diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that pharmacologically-induced sympathetic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> stimulation can induce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subjects with uncomplicated Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have increased sensitivity to exogenous <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> but may not hyperrespond to endogenous sympathetic activation </plain></SENT>
