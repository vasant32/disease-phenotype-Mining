<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This randomized clinical trial included 81 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants were randomly assigned to consume 10g/d BSP (group A), 5g/d BSP (group B), or the placebo (group C), each for 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FBS), total cholesterol (TC), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> concentration (TG), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>, and oxidized-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> were measured at baseline and 4 weeks after treatment </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-two patients completed the study; n=23, 26 and 23 for groups A, B and C, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 4 weeks, BSP in dose of 10g/d, significantly decreased serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, OX-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> ratio and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIP</z:e> (p&lt;0.05 for treatment effect) </plain></SENT>
