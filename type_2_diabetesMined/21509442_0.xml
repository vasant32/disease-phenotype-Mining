<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The precise mechanisms underlying <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> (DACD) remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we investigated the molecular changes associated with DACD using a comparative proteomics study of hippocampus in a rat model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, we tested the effects of the Chinese medicine ZiBu PiYin recipe (ZBPYR) on DACD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The hippocampus was dissected from control, diabetic and diabetic rats treated with ZBPYR (DM/ZBPYR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Soluble proteins were separated using fluorescence-based difference gel electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Protein spots were visualised with fluorescent dyes and spot density was compared between each pair of groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Proteins of interest were identified using mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Proteins of specific interest were also tested by western blot and real-time PCR analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found 13 spots that were altered between control and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> groups, and 12 spots that were changed between <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and DM/ZBPYR groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The identities of nine proteins were determined by mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The identified proteins were largely involved in energy metabolism, cytoskeleton regulation and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The protein alterations observed in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> group were ameliorated to varying degrees following ZBPYR treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The protein changes identified in hippocampus from a rat model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> suggest that specific cellular alterations contribute to DACD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The Chinese medicine ZBPYR was found to affect multiple targets and partially repaired the original cellular balance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This study may provide important insights into the molecular events underlying DACD and allow the identification of novel therapeutic targets </plain></SENT>
