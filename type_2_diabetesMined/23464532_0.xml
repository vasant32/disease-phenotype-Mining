<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (NCT01020123) was conducted over 4 months with an optional 2-month extension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients (n = 458) with HbA1c 7.5-10% were randomized to AZD1656 20 mg (n = 40) or 40 mg (n = 52) fixed doses or 10-140 mg (n = 91) or 20-200 mg (n = 93) titrated doses, placebo (n = 88) or glipizide 5-20 mg titrated (n = 94) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients (n = 72) with HbA1c &gt;10 and ≤12% received open-label AZD1656 (20-200 mg titrated) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Primary outcome was placebo-corrected change in HbA1c from baseline to 4 months of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant reductions in HbA1c from baseline to 4 months were observed with blinded AZD1656 10-140 and 20-200 mg versus placebo [mean (95% CI) changes: -0.80 (-1.14; -0.46) and -0.81 (-1.14; -0.47) %, respectively), with similar reductions observed with glipizide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A higher percentage of patients on AZD1656 than on placebo achieved HbA1c ≤7.0 or ≤6.5 % after 4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean (s.d.) change in HbA1c for open-label AZD1656 (20-200 mg) was -2.8 (1.19) % after 4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>AZD1656 was well tolerated, with less <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> than glipizide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the extension population, HbA1c was still reduced with AZD1656 versus placebo after 6 months, but the effect of AZD1656 on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control was not sustained over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Addition of AZD1656 (individually titrated) to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> gave significant improvements in glycaemic control up to 4 months, although efficacy diminished over time </plain></SENT>
