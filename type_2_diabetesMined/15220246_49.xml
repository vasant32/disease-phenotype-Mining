<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Adiponectin, synthesized in the adipose tissue, appears to play an important role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e>, as well as in inflammatory mechanisms, which lead to a markedly increased atherosclerotic risk in diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, previous studies did not evaluate the complex relationships between adiponectin and the array of <z:mp ids='MP_0005266'>metabolic abnormalities</z:mp> commonly observed in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: To examine the associations between plasma levels of adiponectin and HbA(1c), blood <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, and inflammatory markers, we obtained blood samples from 741 participants in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study with a diagnosis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Plasma adiponectin levels were positively correlated with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> and negatively correlated with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B-100 (apoB(100)), C-reactive protein (CRP), and fibrinogen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These associations were not appreciably altered after controlling for lifestyle exposures, medical conditions, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-associated variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A 10-microg/ml higher level of plasma adiponectin was associated with lower HbA(1c) (-0.21% points, P = 0.001), <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (-0.39 mmol/l, P &lt; 0.001), apoB(100) (-0.04 g/l, P &lt; 0.001), CRP (-0.51 mg/l, P = 0.003), and fibrinogen (-0.53 micromol/l, P &lt; 0.001) and higher <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (0.13 mmol/l, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Associations between adiponectin and inflammatory markers were furthermore independent of HbA(1c) and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, suggesting that the anti-inflammatory properties of adiponectin are not mediated by potential effects on glycemic control and blood <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results were consistent among <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and nonobese men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports the hypothesis that <z:mp ids='MP_0004892'>increased adiponectin levels</z:mp> might be associated with better glycemic control, better <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile, and reduced <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Measures that increase adiponectin levels might be valuable targets for decreasing the atherosclerotic risk present in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
