<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo> will result in a decrease in insulin's ability to stimulate <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake into peripheral tissue and will suppress <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production by the liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the development of peripheral and hepatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> relative to one another in the context of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> is not well understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To examine this phenomena, we used the moderate fat-fed dog model, which has been shown to develop both subcutaneous and visceral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> dogs were fed an isocaloric diet with a modest increase in fat content for 12 weeks, and they were assessed at weeks 0, 6, and 12 for changes in insulin sensitivity and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> turnover </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By week 12 of the diet, there was a more than twofold increase in trunk <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging because of an accumulation in both subcutaneous and visceral fat depots with very little change in body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fasting plasma insulin had increased by week 6 (150% of week 0) and remained increased up to week 12 of the study (170% of week 0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, there appeared to be no change in the rates of insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake as measured by euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamps throughout the course of fat feeding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, there was an increase in steady-state plasma insulin levels at weeks 6 and 12, indicating a moderate degree of peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the moderate defect seen in the periphery, there was a marked impairment in insulin's ability to suppress endogenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production during the clamp such that by week 12 of the study, there was a complete inability of insulin to suppress <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that a diet enriched with a moderate amount of fat results in the development of both subcutaneous and visceral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo>, and a modest degree of peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, there is a complete inability of insulin to suppress hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production during the clamp, suggesting that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> of the liver may be the primary defect in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
