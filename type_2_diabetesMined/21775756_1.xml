<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> basal insulin treatment with insulin glargine improves <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Fourteen patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy received an add-on therapy with insulin glargine over 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests (IVGTTs) were performed before and after the intervention, with and without previous adjustment of fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels using a 3-h intravenous insulin infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fasting glycemia was lowered from 179.6 ± 7.5 to 117.6 ± 6.5 mg/dL (P &lt; 0.001), and HbA(1c) levels declined from 8.4 ± 0.5 to 7.1 ± 0.2% (P = 0.0046) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The final insulin dose was 59.3 ± 10.2 IU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> normalization of fasting glycemia by intravenous insulin reduced C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels during the IVGTT (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, insulin and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> responses to intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> administration were significantly greater after the glargine treatment period (P &lt; 0.0001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both first- and second-phase insulin secretion increased significantly after the glargine treatment period (P &lt; 0.05, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These improvements in insulin secretion were observed during both the experiments with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> adjustment of fasting glycemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> supplementation of long-acting basal insulin improves <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced insulin secretion in hyperglycemic patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> exogenous insulin administration reduces the β-cell response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data provide a rationale for basal insulin treatment regiments to improve postprandial endogenous insulin secretion in hyperglycemic patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
