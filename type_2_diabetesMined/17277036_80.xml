<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a double-blind, randomized, multicenter, parallel group study of a 24-week treatment with 50 mg vildagliptin daily (n = 177), 100 mg vildagliptin daily (n = 185), or placebo (n = 182) in patients continuing a stable <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> dose regimen (&gt; or =1,500 mg/day) but achieving inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5-11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The between-treatment difference (vildagliptin-placebo) in adjusted mean change (AMDelta) +/- SE in A1C from baseline to end point was -0.7 +/- 0.1% (P &lt; 0.001) and -1.1 +/- 0.1% (P &lt; 0.001) in patients receiving 50 or 100 mg vildagliptin daily, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The between-treatment difference in the AMDelta fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) was -0.8 +/- 0.3 mmol/l (P = 0.003) and -1.7 +/- 0.3 mmol/l (P &lt; 0.001) in patients receiving 50 or 100 mg vildagliptin daily, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adverse events (AEs) were reported by 63.3, 65.0, and 63.5% of patients receiving 50 mg vildagliptin daily, 100 mg vildagliptin daily, or placebo, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Gastrointestinal AEs were reported by 9.6 (P = 0.022 vs. placebo), 14.8, and 18.2% of patients receiving 50 mg vildagliptin daily, 100 mg vildagliptin daily, or placebo, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient in each treatment group experienced one mild hypoglycemic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Vildagliptin is well tolerated and produces clinically meaningful, dose-related decreases in A1C and FPG as add-on therapy in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> inadequately controlled by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
