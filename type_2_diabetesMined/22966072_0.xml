<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, mechanisms responsible for smoking-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> are unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we found smokers were less insulin sensitive compared with controls, which increased after either 1 or 2 weeks of smoking cessation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Improvements in insulin sensitivity after smoking cessation occurred with normalization of IRS-1(ser636) phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In muscle cell culture, <z:chebi fb="164" ids="18723">nicotine</z:chebi> exposure significantly increased IRS-1(ser636) phosphorylation and decreased insulin sensitivity, recapitulating the phenotype of smoking-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The two pathways known to stimulate IRS-1(ser636) phosphorylation (p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase [MAPK] and mammalian target of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> [mTOR]) were both stimulated by <z:chebi fb="164" ids="18723">nicotine</z:chebi> in culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of mTOR, but not p44/42 MAPK, during <z:chebi fb="164" ids="18723">nicotine</z:chebi> exposure prevented IRS-1(ser636) phosphorylation and normalized insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data indicate <z:chebi fb="164" ids="18723">nicotine</z:chebi> induces <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in skeletal muscle by activating mTOR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic agents designed to oppose skeletal muscle mTOR activation may prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in humans who are <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0849745" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">unable to stop smoking</z:e> or are chronically exposed to secondhand smoke </plain></SENT>
