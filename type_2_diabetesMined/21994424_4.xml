<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this double-blind study, 587 patients taking stable-dose insulin glargine (±<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> ≥1,500 mg/day) were randomized (1:1:1:1:1) to MK-0941 10, 20, 30, or 40 mg or matching placebo t.i.d. before meals (a.c.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study included an initial 14-week, dose-ranging phase followed by a 40-week treatment phase during which patients were to be uptitrated as tolerated to 40 mg (or placebo) t.i.d. a.c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary efficacy end point was change from baseline in A1C at Week 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At Week 14, A1C and 2-h postmeal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (PMG) improved significantly versus placebo with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> MK-0941 doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Maximal placebo-adjusted least squares mean changes from baseline in A1C (baseline A1C 9.0%) and 2-h PMG were -0.8% and -37 mg/dL (-2 mmol/L), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant effects on fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> were observed at any dose versus placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By 30 weeks, the initial glycemic responses noted at 14 weeks were not sustained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MK-0941 at one or more doses was associated with significant increases in the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, systolic blood pressure, and proportion of patients meeting criteria for predefined limits of change for increased diastolic blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients receiving stable-dose insulin glargine, the GKA MK-0941 led to improvements in glycemic control that were not sustained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MK-0941 was associated with an increased incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> and elevations in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> and blood pressure </plain></SENT>
