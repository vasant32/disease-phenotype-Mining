<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examined the mechanisms by which colesevelam might affect <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c) (HbA(1c)) â‰¥7.5% on either stable diet and exercise or sulphonylurea therapy were randomized to colesevelam 3.75 g/day (n = 16) or placebo (n = 14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hepatic/peripheral insulin sensitivity was evaluated at baseline and at week 12 by infusion of (3) H-labelled <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> followed by a 2-step hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two 75-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests (OGTTs) were conducted at baseline, one with and one without co-administration of colesevelam </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A final OGTT was conducted at week 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HbA(1c) and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) levels were evaluated pre- and post-treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treatment with colesevelam, compared to placebo, had no significant effects on basal endogenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> output, response to insulin or on maximal steady-state <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At baseline, co-administration of colesevelam with oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> reduced total area under the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> curve (AUC(g)) but not incremental AUC(g) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At week 12, neither total AUC(g) nor incremental AUC(g) were changed from pre-treatment values in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Post-load insulin levels increased with colesevelam at 30 and 120 min, but these changes in total area under the insulin curve (AUC(i)) and incremental AUC(i) did not differ between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Both HbA(1c) and FPG improved with colesevelam, but treatment differences were not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Colesevelam does not affect hepatic or peripheral insulin sensitivity and does not directly affect <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> absorption </plain></SENT>
