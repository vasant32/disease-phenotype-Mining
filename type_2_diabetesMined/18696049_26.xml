<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The WNT signalling pathway is involved in many physiological and pathophysiological activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>WNT ligands bind to Frizzled receptors and co-receptors (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> receptor-related protein 5/6), triggering a cascade of signalling events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The major effector of the canonical WNT signalling pathway is the bipartite transcription factor beta-catenin/T cell transcription factor (beta-cat/TCF), formed by free beta-cat and one of the four TCFs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The WNT pathway is involved in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis, and mutations in LRP5 may lead to the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>beta-Cat/TCF is also involved in the production of the incretin hormone glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 in the intestinal <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> L cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>More recently, genome-wide association studies have identified TCF7L2 as a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility gene, and individuals carrying certain TCF7L2 single nucleotide polymorphisms could be more susceptible to the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, beta-cat is able to interact with forkhead box transcription factor subgroup O (FOXO) proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since FOXO and TCF proteins compete for a limited pool of beta-cat, enhanced FOXO activity during ageing and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> may attenuate WNT-mediated activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These observations shed new light on the pathogenesis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> as an age-dependent disease </plain></SENT>
