<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Trials comparing the effectiveness of diets are frequently limited by short follow-up times and high dropout rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: The effects of a low carbohydrate Mediterranean (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCM</z:e>), a traditional Mediterranean (TM), and the 2003 American Diabetic Association (<z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi>) diet were compared, on health parameters during a 12-month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this 12-month trial, 259 overweight diabetic patients (mean age 55 years, mean body mass index 31.4 kg/m(2)) were randomly assigned to one of the three diets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary end-points were reduction of fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, HbA1c and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> (TG) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 194 patients out of 259 (74.9%) completed follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 12 months, the mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients was 8.3 kg: 7.7 kg for <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi>, 7.4 kg for TM and 10.1 kg for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCM</z:e> diets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The reduction in HbA1c was significantly greater in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCM</z:e> diet than in the <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> diet (-2.0 and -1.6%, respectively, p &lt; 0.022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> increased (0.1 mmol/l +/- 0.02) only on the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCM</z:e> (p &lt; 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The reduction in serum TG was greater in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCM</z:e> (-1.3 mmol/l) and TM (-1.5 mmol/l) than in the <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> (-0.7 mmol/l), p = 0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: An intensive 12-month dietary intervention in a community-based setting was effective in improving most modifiable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the dietary groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Only the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCM</z:e> improved <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> levels and was superior to both the <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> and TM in improving glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
