<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the association of variants in genes encoding several transcription factors (TCF1, TCF2, HNF4A, ISL1, IPF1, NEUROG3, PAX6, NKX2-2, NKX6-1, and NEUROD1) and genes encoding the ATP-sensitive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> channel subunits Kir6.2 (KCNJ11) and SUR1 (ABCC8) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a Japanese cohort of 2,834 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The exon 16 -3c/t variant rs1799854 in ABCC8 showed a significant association (P = 0.0073), and variants in several genes showed nominally significant associations (P &lt; 0.05) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although the E23K variant rs5219 in KCNJ11 showed no association with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Japanese (for the K allele, odds ratio [OR] 1.08 [95% CI 0.97-1.21], P = 0.15), 95% CI around the OR overlaps in meta-analysis of European populations, suggesting that our results are not inconsistent with the previous studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This is the largest association study so far conducted on these genes in Japanese and provides valuable information for comparison with other ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
