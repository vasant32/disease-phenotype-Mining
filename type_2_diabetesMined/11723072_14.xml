<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We scanned the Pax4 gene in 200 unrelated Japanese type 2 diabetic patients and found a missense mutation (R121W) in 6 heterozygous patients and 1 homozygous patient (mutant allele frequency 2.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mutation was not found in 161 nondiabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The R121W mutation was located in the paired domain and was thought to affect its transcription activity through lack of DNA binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six of seven patients had family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo>, and four of seven had transient insulin therapy at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One of them, a homozygous carrier, had relatively early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and slowly fell into an insulin-dependent state without an autoimmune-mediated process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is the first report of a Pax4 gene mutation that exhibits loss of function and seems to be associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This work provides significant implications for the Pax4 gene as one of the predisposing genes for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the Japanese </plain></SENT>
