<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is characterized by a relative beta-cell deficit as a result of increased beta-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and islet amyloid derived from the beta-cell <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (IAPP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Human IAPP (h-IAPP) but not mouse IAPP (m-IAPP) induces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> when applied to cells in culture, a property that depends on the propensity of h-IAPP to oligomerize </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since beta-cell mass is regulated, the question arises as to why it is not adaptively increased in response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This adaptation might fail if dividing beta-cells preferentially underwent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that beta-cells are preferentially vulnerable to h-IAPP-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We established a microculture environment to perform time-lapse video microscopy (TLVM) and studied beta-cells (RIN) and HeLa cells undergoing replication or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sequential images (every 10 min for 36 h in RIN or 24 h in HeLa cells) of cells in vivo were analyzed, and each mitotic and apoptotic event was documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Freshly dissolved h-IAPP caused a dose-dependent increased rate of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> (P &lt; 0.0001) in both cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At low and medium levels of toxicity, cells that had previously undergone mitosis were more vulnerable to h-IAPP-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> than nondividing cells (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the first 3 h after mitosis (full cell cycle length 26 +/- 0.6 h), beta-cells were particularly susceptible to h-IAPP-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Neither m-IAPP nor mature amyloid aggregates of h-IAPP were cytotoxic (P = 0.49) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>To corroborate these cell culture studies, we examined sections of human pancreatic tissue (five cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) and human islets incubated for 48 h +/- h-IAPP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Both were stained for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> with the transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick-end labeling method and analyzed for the presence of paired apoptotic cells anticipated in the event of postmitotic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In human pancreatic tissue 26 +/- 5% (single plane of examination) and in human islets incubated with h-IAPP 44 +/- 4% of apoptotic islet cells were paired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, replicating beta-cells are preferentially vulnerable to h-IAPP-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in cell culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Postmitotic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was also documented in humans with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and in human islet tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>We postulate that beta-cell deficiency in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may result in part from failure to adaptively increase beta-cell mass due to increased vulnerability of replicating beta-cells to undergo <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>If this postulate is correct, then inhibition of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> should allow recovery of beta-cell mass in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
