<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the preventive effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17620">ferulic acid</z:chebi> (FA) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22470">alpha-tocopherol</z:chebi> (AT) on the progression of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) and Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) rats were used as type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and non-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> models, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two-thirds of the OLETF rats were fed 0.2% FA-containing or 0.5% AT-containing chow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> was assessed based on urinary protein excretion and pathological changes which were scored based on the percentages of extracellular matrix area in the glomerular area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, renal <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>) expression of intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 (ICAM-1), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) was quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 12 weeks of FA- or AT-supplementation, urinary protein in untreated-OLETF group was significantly higher than that in LETO group, thus FA-supplementation significantly decreased urinary protein excretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pathological scores in FA-supplemented group were significantly lower than those in untreated OLETF group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Supplementation with either FA or AT significantly prevented the elevation of TGF-beta1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression caused by <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment with neither FA nor AT had a significant effect on COX-2 or ICAM-1 mRNA expressions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We have demonstrated the preventative effects of FA on diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> via suppression of TGF-beta1 upregulation, furthermore FA may be more potent than AT </plain></SENT>
