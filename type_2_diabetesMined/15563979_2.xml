<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To identify genetic elements that might confer susceptibility to diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, we performed a genome-wide analysis of gene-based single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a large cohort of Japanese diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In case-control association studies, patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were divided into two groups, one having <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> as well as overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> and the other (the control group) with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> but with no signs of renal involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genotyping of these patients at more than 80,000 SNP loci suggested several distinct regions to be good candidates for the susceptibility to diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that genome-wide search using SNP as a genetic marker is useful to identify the gene(s) susceptible to common diseases such as diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
