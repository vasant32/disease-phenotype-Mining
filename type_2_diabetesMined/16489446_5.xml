<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">Rosiglitazone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> are two oral antihyperglycaemic drugs used to treat type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While both drugs have been shown to improve insulin-sensitive <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake, the direct effects of these drugs on pancreatic beta cells is only now beginning to be clarified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to determine the direct effects of these agents on beta cell gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used reporter gene analysis to examine the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> on the activity of the proinsulin and insulin promoter factor 1 (IPF1) gene promoters in the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-responsive mouse beta cell line Min6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Western blot and gel retardation analyses were used to examine the effects of both drugs on the regulation of IPF1 protein production, nuclear accumulation and DNA binding activity in both Min6 cells and isolated rat islets of Langerhans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over 24 h, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> promoted the nuclear accumulation of IPF1 and forkhead homeobox A2 (FOXA2), independently of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration, and stimulated a two-fold increase in the activity of the Ipf1 gene promoter (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Stimulation of the Ipf1 promoter by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> was unaffected by the presence of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> GW9662 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No effect of either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> was observed on proinsulin promoter activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> stimulated IPF1 nuclear accumulation and DNA binding activity in a time-dependent manner, with maximal effects observed after 2 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> have direct effects on beta cell gene expression, suggesting that these agents may play a previously unrecognised role in the direct regulation of pancreatic beta cell function </plain></SENT>
