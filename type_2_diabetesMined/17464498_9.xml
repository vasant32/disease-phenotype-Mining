<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We conducted a genome-wide linkage scan using 439 short tandem repeat polymorphisms at an average resolution of 7.76 +/- 3.80 cM (Marshfield) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In an affected-only-design (affected sib pairs), we performed nonparametric multipoint linkage analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conditional analyses were applied where linkage signals were found in the baseline analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified two loci with nominal evidence for linkage on chromosomes 1p36.13 and 16p12.2 (D1S3669, 37.05 cM, logarithmic odds ratio [LOD] = 1.49, p = 0.004; D16S403, 43.89 cM, LOD = 1.85, p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>D16S403 crossed the empirically obtained threshold of genome-wide suggestive significance of LOD = 1.51 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Positive findings in those regions have been reported by the following other linkage studies on: (1) symptomatic/clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016977" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gall bladder disease</z:e> with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Mexican Americans from the San Antonio Family <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp>/Gallbladder Study (LOD = 3.7, D1S1597-D1S407, 29.93-33.75 cM); (2) body size-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> in another Mexican American population (D1S1597, LOD = 2.53, 29.93 cM); (3) <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> abnormalities (LOD = 3.1, D1S2826-D1S513, 41.92-60.01 cM); and (4) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in Australian sib pairs (LOD = 3.1, D1S2834-D1S2728, 31.02-33.75 cM); as well as (5) a meta-analysis of four European type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related genome scans (LOD = 1.09, D16S412, 42.81 cM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In linkage analyses conditional on evidence for linkage at D16S403 we identified a LOD increase (Delta LOD) of 1.55 (p = 0.0075) at D17S2180 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similar conditioning on D17S2180 revealed evidence for interaction with D1S3669 (Delta LOD = 1.67, p = 0.0055), D16S403 (Delta LOD = 1.48, p = 0.0091) and another locus on chromosome 1 where several genome scans have reported evidence for linkage ( approximately 200 cM, Delta LOD = 1.60, p = 0.0066) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our results and the findings of other studies are consistent with the presence of a locus for a complex <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> on chromosome 1p36.13 </plain></SENT>
