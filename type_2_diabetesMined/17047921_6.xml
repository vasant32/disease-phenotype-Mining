<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Major support for this assumption was derived from experiments in the gerbil Psammomys obesus (sand rat), a model for nutritionally induced non-insulin-dependent type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using gerbil-specific primers for the analysis of gene expression, we investigated the validity of this hypothesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Gene expression was analysed by real-time RT-PCR of isolated and laser-microdissected islets and by in situ RT-PCR, both in beta cells and in immune cells, as well as in lymph nodes and spleen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We were unable to detect Il-1beta and the IL-1beta-inducible enzyme inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (iNos) by in situ RT-PCR, either in the pancreatic beta cells, or in the small number of non-activated immune cells of healthy and diabetic Psammomys obesus after 1 and 3 weeks on a high-energy diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Very low levels of Il-1beta and iNos <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were detectable in collagenase-isolated and laser-microdissected islets of normoglycaemic gerbils by real-time RT-PCR without any increase of these <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> in islets from diabetic animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results were confirmed by electron microscopy with immunogold staining for IL-1beta and insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The diabetic syndrome induced in Psammomys obesus by high-energy diet is a classical type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> model, which does not show any evidence of an involvement of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1beta or of activated immune cells in its pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is clearly at variance with the situation in type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
