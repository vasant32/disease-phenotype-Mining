<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mtDNA 16189C variant has been reported to be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, a recent meta-analysis concluded that it is negatively associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Europids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since the phenotype of an mtDNA mutant may be influenced by environmental factors and ethnic differences in the nuclear and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> genomes, we investigated the association between the 16189C variant and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Asians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The presence of the mtDNA 16189C variant was determined in 2,469 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 1,205 non-diabetic individuals from Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong and China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An additional meta-analysis including previously published Asian studies was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since mtDNA nucleotide position 16189 is very close to the mtDNA origin of replication, we performed DNA-linked affinity chromatography and reverse-phase liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry and chromatin immunoprecipitation to identify protein bound to the 16189 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Analysis of participants from five Asian countries confirmed the association between the 16189C variant and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> [odds ratio (OR) 1.256, 95% CI 1.08-1.46, p=0.003] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Inclusion of data from three previously published Asian studies (type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> n=3,283, controls n=2,176) in a meta-analysis showed similar results (OR 1.335, 95% CI 1.18-1.51, p=0.000003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>Mitochondrial</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9160">single-stranded DNA</z:chebi>-binding protein (mtSSB) was identified as a candidate protein bound to the 16189 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Chromatin immunoprecipitation in cybrid cells showed that mtSSB has a lower binding affinity for the 16189C variant than the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The mtDNA 16189C variant is associated with an increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Asians </plain></SENT>
