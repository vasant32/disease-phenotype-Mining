<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study we evaluated resistive index at baseline and after vasodilation induced by <z:chebi fb="10" ids="28787">nitroglycerine</z:chebi> in normoalbuminuric patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or essential <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, relating the values to indices of systemic vascular dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Newly diagnosed treatment-naïve type 2 diabetic (n = 32) and hypertensive patients (n = 49) were compared with 27 age- and sex-matched healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Renal resistive index was obtained by duplex ultrasound at baseline and after 25 μg sublingual <z:chebi fb="10" ids="28787">nitroglycerine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endothelium-dependent (flow-mediated dilation) and -independent (response to <z:chebi fb="10" ids="28787">nitroglycerine</z:chebi>) vasodilation in the brachial artery was assessed by computerised edge detection system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Carotid-femoral pulse-wave velocity and augmentation index were assessed by applanation tonometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nitrotyrosine levels, an index of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, were also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Resistive index was higher in diabetic than in hypertensive patients and controls (p &lt; 0.001), while changes in resistive index induced by <z:chebi fb="10" ids="28787">nitroglycerine</z:chebi> were lower in hypertensive patients compared with controls (p &lt; 0.01), and were further reduced in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hypertensive and diabetic patients showed significantly increased arterial stiffness, nitrotyrosine levels and reduced endothelial function than controls (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Changes in resistive index induced by <z:chebi fb="10" ids="28787">nitroglycerine</z:chebi> were independently related to serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, reactive hyperaemia and aortic pulse-wave velocity in the overall population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These results support the dynamic evaluation of renal resistive index as an early detector of renal vascular alterations in the presence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, even before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
