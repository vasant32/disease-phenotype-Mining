<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To construct dose response curves relating the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp>) to mean glycaemic exposure in a cohort of Type 2 patients followed over a period of several years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This allows a comparison with similar data on Type 1 subjects reported by the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) and provides a rational basis for deciding what levels of glycaemic control should be aimed for in advising individual patients and in setting guidelines for conducting health services </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was an analysis of data prospectively collected in our computerized data base for Type 2 patients who attended and were followed up at the Complications Assessment Service of our <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The initial development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> was analyzed with respect to the mean HbA1c during the follow up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Statistical procedures identical to those employed in the DCCT were used to construct the dose response curve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A smooth relationship between the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> with increasing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For every 10% decrease in HbA1c, there was a 24%) (confidence interval (CI): 16-32) reduction in relative risk, about 2/3 of that reported for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100651'>insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0002056'>IDDM</z:mp>) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The relationship between <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> and HbAc was more linear and less steep with a relative risk reduction of 9% (CI: -2-19%) for any 10% fall in HbA1c, about 1/3 of that reported for <z:mp ids='MP_0002056'>IDDM</z:mp> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No threshold of HbA1c can be found for the relative risk of developing complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, more cases of complications are prevented by the same degree of improvement in glycaemic control at higher levels of HbA1c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The development of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> in Type 2 subjects is also related to the magnitude of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> although the degree of dependence is less than that in Type 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Glycaemic control has less influence on <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> in Type 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In terms of relative risk, no threshold of 'safe HbA1c' can be found but in absolute terms more cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> can be prevented by improving the glycaemic control of the very hyperglycaemic patients </plain></SENT>
