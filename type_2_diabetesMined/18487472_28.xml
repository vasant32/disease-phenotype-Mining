<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> mellitus (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e>) have an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) following pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> women aged 20-49 years with live births between April 1994 and March 1997 in Ontario, Canada, were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> were matched with 10 women without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> and were followed for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The matched cohorts included 8,191 women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> and 81,262 women without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean age at entry was 31 years, and median follow-up was 11.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The hazard ratio for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> events was 1.71 (95% CI 1.08-2.69) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for subsequent type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the hazard ratio was attenuated (1.13 [95% CI 0.67-1.89]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Young women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> had a substantially increased risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> compared with women without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Much of this increased risk was attributable to subsequent development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
