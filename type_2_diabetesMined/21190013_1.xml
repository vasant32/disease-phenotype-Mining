<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We carried out a cross-sectional population-based study of 970 participants aged between 30 and 60 years, of which 170 were diagnosed with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on screening (WHO 1999 criteria) and 35 had known type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Procedures included clinical and laboratory examinations, non-invasive assessment of the intrinsic fluorescence of the lens of the eye, and seven-field fundus photography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>Retinopathy</z:hpo> was found in 46 (22%) of 205 participants with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a logistic regression analysis controlling for age, sex and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> status (screen-detected or known), a two-fold increase in lens fluorescence increased the odds for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> by 3.46 (95% CI 1.25-9.55, p = 0.017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The association was marginally significant (OR 3.00 [95% CI 1.00-9.01], p = 0.050) when also adjusted for smoking, systolic blood pressure, body mass index and HbA(1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> was related to cumulative lifelong glycaemia as estimated by lens fluorometry in participants with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This supports the hypothesis that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> is a marker of lifelong elevated glycaemia as well as of the unknown, pre-diagnostic duration of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The powerful association between lens fluorescence and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> underscores the importance of strict long-term glycaemic control in the prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> in people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
