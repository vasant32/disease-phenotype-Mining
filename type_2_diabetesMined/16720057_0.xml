<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 40 type 2 diabetic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> (LVH) were randomly assigned to receive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3347">candesartan</z:chebi> (n=20) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2668">amlodipine</z:chebi> (n=20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The two treatments when administered for 6 months significantly reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressures (BPs) to a comparable extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Notably, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3347">candesartan</z:chebi> significantly reduced left ventricular mass index (LVMI: from 131.5+/-4.5 to 112.1+/-5.9g/m(2), P=0.0009, M+/-S.E.M.), LV posterior wall thickness (PWTd: from 10.3+/-0.3 to 9.1+/-0.3mm, P=0.0052) and interventricular septal thickness (IVSTd: from 10.7+/-0.4 to 9.3+/-0.4mm, P=0.0019) as determined by echocardiography in diastole, but <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2668">amlodipine</z:chebi> treatment did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LVMI, PWTd and IVSTd were decreased more significantly by the treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3347">candesartan</z:chebi> than by that with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2668">amlodipine</z:chebi> (P=0.020, 0.031 and 0.043) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present study thus revealed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3347">candesartan</z:chebi> effectively induced regression of LVH in type 2 diabetic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> due to effects beyond reduction in BP </plain></SENT>
