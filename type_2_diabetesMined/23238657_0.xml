<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to examine the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> effects of an oral load of heat-treated, AGE-modified β-lactoglobulins (AGE-BLG) compared with heat-treated, nonglycated BLG (C-BLG) on vascular function in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM).RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSIn a double-blind, controlled, randomized, crossover study, 19 patients with T2DM received, on two different occasions, beverages containing either AGE-BLG or C-BLG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We measured macrovascular [brachial ultrasound of flow-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> (FMD)] and microvascular (laser-Doppler measurements of reactive hyperemia in the hand) functions at baseline (T(0)), 90 (T(90)), and 180 (T(180)) min.RESULTSFollowing the AGE-BLG, FMD decreased at T(90) by 80% from baseline and remained decreased by 42% at T(180) (P &lt; 0.05 vs. baseline, P &lt; 0.05 vs. C-BLG at T90) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By comparison, following C-BLG, FMD decreased by 27% at T(90) and 51% at T(180) (P &lt; 0.05 vs. baseline at T180) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A significant decrease in <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> (T(180)) and nitrate (T(90) and T(180)), as well as a significant increase in N(ε)-carboxymethyllisine, accompanied intake of AGE-BLG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no change in microvascular function caused by either beverage.CONCLUSIONSIn patients with T2DM, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> oral administration of a single AGE-modified protein class significantly though transiently impaired macrovascular function in concert with decreased nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> bioavailability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These AGE-related changes were independent of heat treatment </plain></SENT>
