<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine whether enteric-coated pellets, releasing small amounts of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30805">lauric acid</z:chebi> throughout the ileum and colon, could reduce glycaemic responses to meals in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, associated with stimulation of GLP-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eligible patients, who had type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> controlled by diet or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, were each studied on two occasions in a hospital setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After an overnight fast, patients consumed 5 g active pellets (47% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30805">lauric acid</z:chebi> by weight) or placebo with breakfast (T = 0 min) and lunch (T = 240 min), in a crossover design with order randomised by the hospital pharmacy and allocation concealed by numbered containers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients and investigators making measurements were blinded to the intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood was sampled frequently for blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (the primary outcome) and hormone assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight patients were randomised (four to receive either intervention first), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> completed the study without adverse effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was lower after breakfast (T = 0-240 min, area under the curve (AUC) 2,075 ± 368 vs 2,216 ± 163 mmol/l × min) and lunch (T = 240-480 min, AUC 1,916 ± 115 vs 2,088 ± 151 mmol/l × min) (p = 0.02 for each) after active pellets than after placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Plasma GLP-1 concentrations were higher after breakfast (p = 0.08) and lunch (p = 0.04) for active pellets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>While there were no differences in insulin or <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent insulinotropic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> concentrations, glucagon concentrations were higher after breakfast and lunch (p = 0.002 for each) for active pellets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Delivering small amounts of nutrient to the ileum and colon can stimulate substantial endogenous GLP-1 release and attenuate postprandial glycaemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This novel approach has therapeutic potential in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
