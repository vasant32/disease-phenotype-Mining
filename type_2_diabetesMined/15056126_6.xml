<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>Age of onset</z:hpo> of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is becoming earlier and with it there is an increase in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examined the relationship between the strength of family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on (i) age of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and (ii) prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data on family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and age of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> were prospectively collected on 5193 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Family members were deemed to include grandparents, parents, siblings, aunts/uncles and children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To adjust for family size and to assess effects of pathway to diagnosis, we also contacted a subset of 180 patients selected on the basis of the strength of family histories of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A full assessment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> and renal and macrovascular status was performed for the total cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The more cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> found in a family, the younger the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon does not appear to be due to patients with strong family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> being more concerned about the possibility of having <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The effect of strong family history is also evident in many ethnic groups when examined individually, although they differ from each other in their characteristic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Once adjusted for duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, strength of family history does not appear to affect metabolic profiles or prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is a strong relationship between the number of affected family members with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and age of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The genetic and environmental factors underlying this phenomenon remain to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, it may be one of the reasons explaining why type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is affecting younger people worldwide </plain></SENT>
