<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When K ATP channels open, beta-cells hyperpolarize and insulin secretion is suppressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prediction that K ATP channel "overactivity" should cause a diabetic state due to undersecretion of insulin has been dramatically borne out by recent genetic studies implicating "activating" mutations in the Kir6.2 subunit of K ATP channel as causal in human <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This article summarizes the emerging picture of K ATP channel as a major cause of neonatal <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and of a polymorphism in K ATP channel (E23K) as a type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The degree of K ATP channel "overactivity" correlates with the severity of the diabetic phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At one end of the spectrum, polymorphisms that result in a modest increase in K ATP channel activity represent a risk factor for development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the other end, severe "activating" mutations underlie syndromic neonatal <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, with multiple organ involvement and complete failure of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent insulin secretion, reflecting K ATP channel "overactivity" in both pancreatic and extrapancreatic tissues </plain></SENT>
