<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This review examines whether positive patient outcomes are observed even after relatively small amounts of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, that is, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> being more easily attainable in practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical studies demonstrate that therapeutic benefit rises with increasing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, but that losses as low as 0.45-4 kg (1-9 lb) have positive effects on metabolic control, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> and mortality rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Even the intention to lose weight, without significant success, can improve outcomes in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, presumably because of the healthy behaviours associated with the attempt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The current data support a continued focus on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, including moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, as a key component of good care for overweight patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
