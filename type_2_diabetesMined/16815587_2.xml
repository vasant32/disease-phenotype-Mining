<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study population included 1078 consecutive patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (47% women, mean age 67.6+/-9.8 years) visited at eight diabetic care clinics between 1 and 30 of November 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Values of glycosilated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, blood pressure, and cholesterol subfractions, as well as clinical and medication data, were prospectively collected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases in a computerized database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Despite a high prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (66.6%), only 29.6% of patients met the treatment goal of a systolic blood pressure &lt;130 mmHg, while a diastolic blood pressure &lt;80 mmHg was reached by 38.6% of the study cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Optimal <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> values (&lt;100mg/dl) were present in just 25.5% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Values of glycosilated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> &lt;7% were present in 57.8% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that adherence to current guidelines for cardiovascular prevention and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factor</z:e> control represent an exception in diabetic patients attending community-based diabetic care clinics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Major efforts are required to improve the quality of health care currently delivered to diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
