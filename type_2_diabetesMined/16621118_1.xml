<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A group of 193 consecutive type 2 and type 1 diabetic subjects (95 men, 98 women) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 104 subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was measured using a <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> meter and blood was obtained for serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> measurement in the laboratory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 89 diabetic subjects random blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was measured using the same <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> meter and a whole blood sample was drawn for laboratory assessment of HbA1c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data on self-monitoring and other clinical and personal characteristics were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: More than 75% of either type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients never self-monitored blood or urine <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In type 2 diabetic subjects self-monitoring of blood or urine <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was not related to glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In type 1 diabetic subjects, however, self-monitoring of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was significantly associated with better glycaemic control, as assessed by HbA1c (P=0.02) and blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> at clinic visits (P&lt; or =0.0001), and similar associations were found for urine <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> self-monitoring (P=0.04 and 0.02) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neither glycaemic control nor <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> self-monitoring was associated with education level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Self-monitoring of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was not found to be associated to better glycaemic control in Sudanese subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, self-monitoring of both blood and urine <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was significantly associated with glycaemic control in subjects with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Self-monitoring of urine <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> could be useful where measurement of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> is not available or affordable </plain></SENT>
