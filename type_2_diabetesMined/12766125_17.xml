<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between serum <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> concentration and carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> as well as major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> in men with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Serum free and total <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> concentrations were measured in 253 consecutive men with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The relationships between serum <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> concentration and carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, determined by ultrasonographically evaluated intima-media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) and plaque score (PS) in a subgroup of 154 diabetic patients, as well as major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, including age, blood pressure, and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> concentrations, were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Inverse correlations were found between free <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> (F-<z:chebi fb="90" ids="30454">tes</z:chebi>) concentration and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> (r = -0.206, P = 0.0103) and between F-<z:chebi fb="90" ids="30454">tes</z:chebi> concentration and PS (r = -0.334, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> and PS were significantly greater in patients with lower concentrations of F-<z:chebi fb="90" ids="30454">tes </z:chebi>(&lt;10 pg/ml) than in patients with higher concentrations of F-<z:chebi fb="90" ids="30454">tes </z:chebi>(1.01 +/- 0.29 vs. 0.91 +/- 0.26 mm, P = 0.038; 4.5 +/- 3.8 vs. 2.4 +/- 3.2, P = 0.0003; respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An inverse correlation was found between serum F-<z:chebi fb="90" ids="30454">tes</z:chebi> concentration and age (r = -0.420, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A positive correlation was found between serum F-<z:chebi fb="90" ids="30454">tes</z:chebi> and total cholesterol concentrations (r = 0.145, P = 0.0238) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Serum F-<z:chebi fb="90" ids="30454">tes</z:chebi> concentration is inversely associated with carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> determined by ultrasonographically evaluated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> and PS in men with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
