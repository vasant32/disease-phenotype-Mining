<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Efficacy data from five double-blind, randomized, placebo- or active-controlled trials of &gt;or=24 weeks' duration were pooled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Effects of 24-week vildagliptin monotherapy (100 mg daily) were compared in younger (&lt;65 years, n = 1,231) and older (&gt;or=65 years, n = 238) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Safety data from eight controlled clinical trials of &gt;or=12-weeks' duration were pooled; adverse event profiles in younger (n = 1,890) and older (n = 374) patients were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean baseline A1C and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) were significantly lower in older (70 years: 8.3 +/- 0.1% and 9.6 +/- 0.1 mmol/l, respectively) than in younger (50 years: 8.7 +/- 0.0% and 10.5 +/- 0.1 mmol/l, respectively) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite this, the adjusted mean change from baseline (AMDelta) in A1C was -1.2 +/- 0.1% in older and -1.0 +/- 0.0% in younger vildagliptin-treated patients (P = 0.092), and the AMDelta in FPG was significantly larger in older (-1.5 +/- 0.2 mmol/l) than in younger (-1.1 +/- 0.1 mmol/l, P = 0.035) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Body weight was significantly lower at baseline in older (83.4 +/- 1.0 kg) than in younger (92.0 +/- 0.6 kg) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Weight decreased significantly in the older subgroup (AMDelta -0.9 +/- 0.3 kg, P = 0.007), whereas smaller, nonsignificant decreases occurred in younger patients (AMDelta -0.2 +/- 0.1 kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adverse event rates were slightly higher in older than in younger subgroups but were lower among older, vildagliptin-treated subjects (63.6%) than in the pooled active comparator group (68.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Vildagliptin treatment did not increase adverse events among older patients with mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal impairment</z:e> (62.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>Hypoglycemia</z:hpo> was rare (0.8%) in the elderly patients, and no severe events occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Vildagliptin monotherapy was effective and well tolerated in treatment-naive elderly patients </plain></SENT>
