<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Polymorphisms in HLA-DQB1, INS, PTPN22, and CTLA4 were genotyped in patients with LADA (n = 213), type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosed at &gt;35 years of age (T1D(&gt;35y); n = 257) or &lt;20 years of age (T1D(&lt;20y); n = 158), and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although patients with LADA had an increased frequency of HLA-DQB1 and PTPN22 risk genotypes and alleles compared with type 2 diabetic subjects, the frequency was significantly lower compared with T1D(&gt;35y) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genotype frequencies, measures of insulin secretion, and metabolic traits within LADA differed according to GAD antibody (GADA) quartiles, but even the highest quartile differed from type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Having two or more risk genotypes was associated with lower C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> concentrations in LADA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LADA patients differed genetically and phenotypically from both T1D(&gt;35y) and type 2 diabetic patients in a manner dependent on GADA levels </plain></SENT>
