<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> is characterised by increased plasma NEFA and IL-6 concentrations, and IL-6 increases lipolysis in healthy men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed the adipose tissue hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression, protein expression and HSL activity in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, and determined the effect of IL-6 administration on these measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seven patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (age 67+/-4 years, weight 87+/-7 kg) and six age- and weight-matched individuals visited the laboratory on two occasions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies and blood samples were obtained prior to and during 3 h of either saline or recombinant human IL-6 infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HSL <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was reduced (p&lt;0.05) by approximately 40% in type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> relative to control subjects, while HSL protein expression showed a tendency to be decreased (35%, p=0.09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HSL activity averaged 8.87+/-1.25 and 6.91+/-1.20 nmol min(-1) mg(-1) protein for control and type 2 diabetic subjects respectively (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IL-6 administration increased (p&lt;0.05) HSL <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> 2-fold at 60 min in both groups, whereas HSL protein and activity were unaffected by IL-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasma insulin was elevated (p&lt;0.05) in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> at rest and was blunted (p&lt;0.05) during IL-6 infusion in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Plasma glucagon and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> were elevated (p&lt;0.05) by IL-6 in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our data demonstrate that basal HSL is decreased in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, and this may be a consequence of elevated plasma insulin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We have also shown that IL-6 administration increases HSL gene expression, although it exerted no effect on HSL protein and activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This disparity between <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, protein and enzyme activity may be a function either of the marked alterations in the hormonal milieu induced by IL-6 administration and/or of post-transcriptional events </plain></SENT>
