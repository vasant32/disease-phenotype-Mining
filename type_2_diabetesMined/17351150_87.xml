<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Muscle biopsies obtained from 10 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> type 2 diabetic and 8 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> nondiabetic male subjects were used for assessment of 3-hydroxy-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17984">Acyl-CoA</z:chebi>-dehydrogenase (HAD) and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50744">citrate</z:chebi> synthase activity, uncoupling protein (UCP)3 content, <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> measured as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32585">4-hydroxy-2-nonenal</z:chebi> (HNE), fiber type distribution, and respiration in isolated mitochondria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Respiration was normalized to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50744">citrate</z:chebi> synthase activity (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> content) in isolated mitochondria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Maximal <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-stimulated respiration (state 3) with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> plus malate and respiration through the electron transport chain (ETC) were reduced in type 2 diabetic patients, and the proportion of type 2X fibers were higher in type 2 diabetic patients compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in respiration with palmitoyl-l-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi> plus malate, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50744">citrate</z:chebi> synthase activity, HAD activity, UCP3 content, or <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> measured as HNE between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the whole group, state 3 respiration with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> plus malate and respiration through ETC were negatively associated with A1C, and the proportion of type 2X fibers correlated with markers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we provide evidence for a functional impairment in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> respiration and increased amount of type 2X fibers in muscle of type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
