<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>11HSD1 inhibitors are being developed for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and may be most effective in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, where adipose 11HSD1 is increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the magnitude of regeneration of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> in different tissues in humans is unknown, hindering understanding of the pathophysiological and therapeutic importance of 11HSD1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In eight healthy men, we infused 9,11,12,12-(2)H4-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> and measured tracer enrichment in the hepatic vein as an indicator of total splanchnic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> generation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Oral <z:chebi fb="11" ids="16962">cortisone</z:chebi> (25 mg) was then given to measure first-pass hepatic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> generation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In steady state, splanchnic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> production was 45 +/- 11 nmol/min when arterialized plasma <z:chebi fb="11" ids="16962">cortisone</z:chebi> concentration was 92 +/- 7 nmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Extrapolation from hepatic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> generation after oral <z:chebi fb="11" ids="16962">cortisone</z:chebi> suggested that, at steady state, the liver contributes 15.2 nmol/min and extrahepatic splanchnic tissue contributes 29.8 nmol/min to the total splanchnic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that tissues draining into the portal vein, including visceral adipose tissue, contribute substantially to the regeneration of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, in addition to free fatty acids and adipokines, the portal vein delivers <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> to the liver, and inhibition of 11HSD1 in visceral adipose tissue may indeed be valuable in ameliorating <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
