<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>GLP-1 peptides, including Liraglutide, cross the blood-brain barrier and may additionally act to improve brain function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study tested the hypothesis that, in addition to its antihyperglycaemic actions, peripheral administration of Liraglutide exerts positive actions on cognitive function in mice with high fat dietary-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Young Swiss TO mice maintained on high fat diet for 20 weeks received twice-daily injections of Liraglutide (200 Âµg/kg bw; sc) or saline vehicle over 28 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An additional group of mice on standard diet received twice-daily saline injections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Energy intake, bodyweight, non-fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin concentrations were monitored at regular intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, open field assessment, object recognition testing and electrophysiological long-term potentiation (LTP) were performed at termination of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Liraglutide treatment resulted in significant time-dependent reduction in bodyweight and energy intake, whilst improving non-fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and normalizing <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although Liraglutide did not alter general behaviour, treated mice exhibited marked increase in recognition index (RI) during object recognition testing, indicative of enhanced learning and memory ability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, Liraglutide rescued the deleterious effects of high fat diet on hippocampal LTP of neurotransmission following both <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> and direct intracerebroventricular (icv) administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Liraglutide administered peripherally not only improves metabolic parameters but exerts additional beneficial effects on cognitive function and hippocampal synaptic plasticity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Whether therapy with GLP-1 mimetics has similar effects in humans with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> needs to be established </plain></SENT>
