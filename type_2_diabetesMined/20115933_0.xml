<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>HEART2D was a multinational, randomized, controlled trial designed to compare the effects of prandial insulin versus basal insulin on risk for subsequent cardiovascular (CV) outcomes in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2D) after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Trial design was based on the hypothesis that 2.5 mmol/L postprandial blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (BG) difference between groups would result in risk reduction of 19 to 23% over the planned follow up period (18-36 mo) in the group with lower postprandial BG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One thousand one hundred and fifteen (1115) patients were randomized [prandial strategy (N = 557), basal strategy (N = 558)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HEART2D was stopped after futility rule implementation at the fourth interim analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The risk of a first combined adjudicated CV events in the prandial group (N = 174, 31.2%) and basal (N = 181, 32.4%) groups was similar (HR = 0.98; 95% CI [0.8, 1.21]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results of HEART2D left the question of the role of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011998'>postprandial hyperglycemia</z:hpo> in diabetic CV disease unanswered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Here, we discuss possible reasons for this outcome, including characteristics of daily BG profiles in the two treatment groups, event rate, risk factors other than standard CV risk factors and glycemic variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The main reasons for this outcome of HEART2D study could be smaller than expected on-study differences between the study groups in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011998'>postprandial hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, and low event rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further trials with larger patient populations and improved designs, focusing also on diabetic patients with lower cardiovascular risk and lower baseline HbA(1c) levels are needed in order to shed more light on this important clinical problem </plain></SENT>
