<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Protein alteration resulting from a nonenzymatic reaction between ambient <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46882">primary amino groups</z:chebi> on proteins to form glycated residues called Amadori products is termed the Maillard reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By <z:hpo ids='HP_0001944'>dehydration</z:hpo> and fragmentation reactions, Amadori products are transformed to stable covalent adducts called advanced glycosylation end products (AGEs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, accelerated synthesis and tissue deposition of AGEs is proposed as a contributing mechanism in the pathogenesis of clinical complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0009644'>Uremia</z:mp> in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is associated with both a high serum level of AGEs and accelerated macro- and microvasculopathy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diabetic uremic patients accumulate advanced glycosylated end products in "toxic" amounts that are not decreased to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis but fall sharply to within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range within 8 h of restoration of half-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> glomerular filtration by renal transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It follows that the higher mortality of hemodialysis-treated diabetic patients compared with those given a renal transplant may relate, in part, to persistent AGE toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pharmacologic prevention of AGE formation is an attractive means of preempting diabetic microvascular complications because it bypasses the necessity of having to attain euglycemia, an often unattainable goal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pimagidine (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="40618">aminoguanidine</z:chebi>) interferes with nonenzymatic glycosylation and reduces measured AGE levels leading to its investigation as a potential treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mechanism by which pimagidine prevents renal, eye, nerve, and other microvascular complications in animal models of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is under investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Separate multicenter clinical trials of pimagidine in type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, where <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> is attributable to diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, are in progress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The effect of treatment on the amount of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo>, progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal insufficiency</z:hpo>, and the course of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> will be monitored </plain></SENT>
