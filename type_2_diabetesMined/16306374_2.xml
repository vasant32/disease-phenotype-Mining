<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We genotyped 13 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in IGFBP1 gene in 732 representative type 2 diabetic patients from the Salford <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Register </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the 13 SNPs, 8 were polymorphic and 7 of those had minor allele frequencies &gt;0.1, one of which was in the gene promoter and one of which was nonsynonymous in exon 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The minor alleles of these SNPs and two others were associated with a reduced prevalence of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Haplotype analysis revealed that 97% of the genetic variation for IGFBP1 in the population sample could be accounted for using two of the "reno-protective" SNPs, with other SNPs adding little extra information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One of these two SNPs was the nonsynonymous mutation in exon 4, lying close to the integrin-binding RGD motif, which is thought to affect tissue delivery of IGF-I by IGF-binding protein 1 (IGFBP-1), possibly suggesting a "reno-protective" effect via altered IGFBP-1 binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we have described the first genomic markers to be associated with diabetic microvascular complications within the human IGFBP1 gene </plain></SENT>
