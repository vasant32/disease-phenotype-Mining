<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Conjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17351">linoleic acid</z:chebi> (CLA) is a natural constituent of dairy products, specific isomers of which have recently been found to have insulin sensitizing and possible antiobesity actions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="74" ids="28073">Chromium</z:chebi> is a micronutrient which, as the picolinate (CrP), has been shown to increase insulin sensitivity in animal models, including the JCR:LA-cp rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that these agents may have beneficial synergistic effects on the micro- and macrovasculopathy associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020459" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperinsulinaemia</z:e> and early type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Insulin-resistant cp/cp rats of the JCR:LA-cp strain were treated with mixed isomers of CLA (1.5% w/w in the chow) and/or CrP at 80 microg/kg/day (expressed as Cr) from 4 weeks of age to 12 weeks of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma insulin, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> and adiponectin levels, aortic vascular function, renal function and <z:mp ids='MP_0005264'>glomerular sclerosis</z:mp> were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CLA administration reduced food intake, body weight and fasting insulin in JCR:LA-cp rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma adiponectin levels were significantly elevated in rats treated with both CLA and CrP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Aortic hypercontractility was reduced and the relaxant response to the nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi>-releasing agent <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="93" ids="22614">Ach</z:chebi>) was increased in CrP-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Striking reductions were also observed in the level of urinary albumin and the severity of <z:mp ids='MP_0005264'>glomerular sclerosis</z:mp> in rats treated specifically with CLA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CLA and CrP have beneficial effects ameliorating several of the pathophysiologic features of an insulin-resistant rat model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These supplements may be useful adjuncts in the management of patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> and warrant further study </plain></SENT>
