<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adequately powered studies with prospective, unbiased, standardised assessment of key behavioural factors for gene-lifestyle studies are lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This case-cohort study aims to investigate how genetic and potentially modifiable lifestyle and behavioural factors, particularly diet and physical activity, interact in their influence on the risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Incident cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> occurring in European Prospective Investigation into <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> and Nutrition (EPIC) cohorts between 1991 and 2007 from eight of the ten EPIC countries were ascertained and verified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prentice-weighted Cox regression and random-effects meta-analyses were used to investigate differences in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence by age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 12,403 verified incident cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> occurred during 3.99 million person-years of follow-up of 340,234 EPIC participants eligible for InterAct </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We defined a centre-stratified subcohort of 16,154 individuals for comparative analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Individuals with incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were randomly selected into the subcohort (n = 778) were included as cases in the analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> prevalent <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> cases were excluded from the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>InterAct cases were followed-up for an average of 6.9 years; 49.7% were men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean baseline age and age at diagnosis were 55.6 and 62.5 years, mean BMI and waist circumference values were 29.4 kg/m(2) and 102.7 cm in men, and 30.1 kg/m(2) and 92.8 cm in women, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> increased linearly with age, with an overall HR of 1.56 (95% CI 1.48-1.64) for a 10 year age difference, adjusted for sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A male excess in the risk of incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was consistently observed across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> countries, with a pooled HR of 1.51 (95% CI 1.39-1.64), adjusted for age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: InterAct is a large, well-powered, prospective study that will inform our understanding of the interplay between genes and lifestyle factors on the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> development </plain></SENT>
