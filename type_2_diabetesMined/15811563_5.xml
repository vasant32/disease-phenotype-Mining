<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have recently reported that ingestion of Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb 761) (a) significantly reduced collagen-induced platelet aggregation and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">thromboxane B2</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">TXB2</z:chebi>) production in both non-diabetic individuals as well as those with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM), (b) significantly reduced platelet malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>), an index of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation, in non-diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study we report that ingestion of EGb 761 (120 mg daily for 3 months), significantly decreased platelet <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="33202">thiobarbituric acid</z:chebi> reacting substances (TBARS) (41 +/- 9 pmol/10(7) platelets versus 30 +/- 11 pmol/10(7) platelets) (p &lt; 0.005) in T2DM subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cholesterol levels (total cholesterol, 164 +/- 22 mg/dl; age, 54 +/- 9 years; BMI, 35.0 +/- 8.8 kg/m2, n = 12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In T2DM subjects with high cholesterol (total cholesterol, 218 +/- 15 mg/dl; age, 52 +/- 5 years; BMI, 36.2 +/- 6.6 kg/m2, n = 7), EGb 761 ingestion reduced the platelet TBARS from 29 +/- 9 to 22 +/- 9 pmol/10(7) platelets (p &lt; 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because ingestion of EGb 761 did not alter platelet counts it is concluded that EGb 761, probably due to the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="47916">flavonoid</z:chebi> fraction, reduced the TBARS by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX)-1-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> oxygenation or by reducing the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> pool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This is likely to lead to a reduction of platelet <z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo>, a significant contributor to the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> in T2DM patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because of other reported beneficial properties of EGb 761, such as stimulation of pancreatic beta-cell function in T2DM subjects with pancreatic exhaustion, it appears that T2DM subjects might benefit from ingesting EGb 761 as a <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50733">dietary supplement</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
