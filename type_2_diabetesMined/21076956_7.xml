<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The methods used in these validation studies were diverse, however, and sometimes insufficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hence, we assessed the discrimination and calibration of the UKPDS risk engine to predict 4, 5, 6 and 8 year cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The cohort included 1,622 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During a mean follow-up of 8 years, patients were followed for incidence of CHD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Discrimination and calibration were assessed for 4, 5, 6 and 8 year risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Discrimination was examined using the c-statistic and calibration by visually inspecting calibration plots and calculating the Hosmer-Lemeshow Ï‡(2) statistic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The UKPDS risk engine showed moderate to poor discrimination for both CHD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> (c-statistic of 0.66 for both 5 year CHD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risks), and an overestimation of the risk (224% and 112%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The calibration of the UKPDS risk engine was slightly better for patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who had been diagnosed with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> more than 10 years ago compared with patients diagnosed more recently, particularly for 4 and 5 year predicted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> and CHD risks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Discrimination for these periods was still moderate to poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We observed that the UKPDS risk engine overestimates CHD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The discriminative ability of this model is moderate, irrespective of various subgroup analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>To enhance the prediction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, this model should be updated </plain></SENT>
