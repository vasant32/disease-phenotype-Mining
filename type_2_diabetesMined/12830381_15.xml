<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to investigate a possible contribution of SNPs in the UTS2 gene to the development of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We surveyed SNPs in the UTS2 gene in 152 Japanese subjects with Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and two control Japanese cohorts: one consisting of 122 elderly subjects who met stringent criteria for being non-diabetic, including being older than 60 years of age with no evidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (HbA(1c)&lt;5.6%), and another 268 subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified two SNPs with amino acid substitutions, designated T21M and S89N </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The allele frequency of 89N was higher in Type 2 diabetic patients than in both elderly <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects (p=0.0018) and subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (p=0.0011), whereas the allele frequency of T21M was essentially identical in these three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in the subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, 89N was associated with higher insulin concentrations on oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test, suggesting reduced insulin sensitivity in subjects with 89N </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: These results strongly suggest that the S89N polymorphism in the UTS2 gene is associated with the development of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, via insulin sensitivity, in Japanese subjects </plain></SENT>
