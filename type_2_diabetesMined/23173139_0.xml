<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted an electronic search until February 2012, including online registries of ongoing trials and abstract books </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> randomized controlled trials comparing ILPS with insulin glargine or detemir with a duration of ≥12 weeks were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found four trials lasting 24-36 weeks involving 1,336 persons: three studies compared ILPS with glargine, and one trial compared ILPS with detemir </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in change in HbA(1c) level between ILPS and comparators, in the proportion of patients achieving the HbA(1c) goals of ≤6.5 or &lt;7%, in weight change, or in daily insulin doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in overall <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>, but nocturnal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> occurred significantly more with ILPS than with comparator insulins (mean difference 0.099 events/patient/30 days [95% CI 0.03-0.17]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a prespecified sensitivity analysis comparing data obtained in patients who remained on their once-daily insulin regimen, not significantly different event rates for nocturnal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> were observed between ILPS and comparator insulins (0.063 [-0.007 to 0.13]), and ILPS was associated with lower insulin dose (0.07 units/kg/day [0.05-0.09]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is no difference between ILPS and insulin glargine or detemir for targeting <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, but nocturnal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> occurred more frequently with ILPS than with comparator insulins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nocturnal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> was not significantly different in people who injected insulin once daily </plain></SENT>
