<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After initial metabolic characterization, subjects were randomized to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> treatment groups; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi> (10 mg BID) as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment was continued for 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The extent of glycemic control after treatment was similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the increase in maximal insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal rate was greater following <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> therapy (+44%) compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> treatment (+20%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">Troglitazone</z:chebi> treatment increased serum adiponectin levels nearly threefold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no change in serum adiponectin with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A positive correlation was found between increases in whole-body <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal rates and serum adiponectin levels after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi>; no such relationship was seen with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The adiponectin protein content of subcutaneous abdominal adipocytes was increased following <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> treatment and unchanged after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Adiponectin release from adipocytes was also augmented with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Adiponectin was present in adipocytes and plasma in several multimeric forms; a trimer was the major form secreted from adipocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that increases in adiponectin content and secretion are associated with improved insulin action but are not directly related to glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Modulation of adipocyte function, including upregulation of adiponectin synthesis and secretion, may be an important mechanism by which <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> influence insulin action </plain></SENT>
