<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Management guidelines recommend <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> as the first-line therapy for most patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> uncontrolled by diet and exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Efficacy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> therapy is usually of limited duration, which necessitates the early introduction of one or two additional oral agents or the initiation of injections, glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> or insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although safe and effective, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy has been associated with gastrointestinal side effects (≈20% of treated patients in randomized studies) and is contraindicated in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal insufficiency</z:hpo> or severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients treated with a sulphonylurea are at increased risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> and moderate <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>, whereas those receiving a thiazolidinedione are subject to an increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> or fracture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>Weight gain</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> are associated with insulin use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, there is an unmet need for a safe and efficacious add-on agent after initial-therapy failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Evidence suggests that incretin-based agents, such as GLP-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, can successfully achieve glycaemic targets and potentially provide cardiovascular and β-cell-function benefits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This review will examine current approaches for treating type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and discuss the place of incretin therapies, mainly GLP-1 agonists, in the type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treatment spectrum </plain></SENT>
