<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a retrospective, observational cohort study of previously untreated elderly patients (aged &gt; or = 66 years) identified as new users of an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive drug</z:chebi> class between April 1995 and March 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using a Cox proportional hazards model, the primary analysis compared <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence in users of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitors</z:chebi>, beta-blockers, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38215">calcium channel blockers</z:chebi> (CCBs), with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50264">thiazide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretics</z:chebi> allowed as second-line therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the secondary analysis, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50264">thiazide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretics</z:chebi> were added as a fourth study group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the multivariable-adjusted primary analysis (n = 76,176), neither <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitor</z:chebi> use (hazard ratio 0.96 [95% CI 0.84-1.1]) nor beta-blocker use (0.86 [0.74-1.0]) was associated with a statistically significant difference in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence compared with the CCB control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the secondary analysis (n = 100,653), compared with CCB users, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence was not significantly different between users of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitors</z:chebi> (0.97 [0.83-1.1]), beta-blockers (0.84 [0.7-1.0]), or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50264">thiazide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretics</z:chebi> (1.0 [0.89-1.2]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence did not significantly differ among users of the major <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive drug</z:chebi> classes in this elderly, population-based administrative cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results do not support the theory that different <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive drug</z:chebi> classes are relatively more or less likely to cause <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
