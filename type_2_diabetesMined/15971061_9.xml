<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Of 32,826 women from the Nurses' Health Study who provided blood at baseline, we followed 921 who had a confirmed diagnosis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During 10 years of follow-up (6,835 person-years), we documented 122 incident cases of CHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for age, smoking, BMI, glycosylated HbA(1)c, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (TGs), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, the relative risk (RR) comparing extreme quintiles of Lp(a) was 1.95 (95% CI 1.07-3.56) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The association was not appreciably altered after further adjustment for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B(100) or several inflammatory biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increasing levels of Lp(a) were associated with lower levels of TGs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The probability of developing CHD over 10 years was higher among diabetic women with substantially higher levels of both Lp(a) (&gt;1.07 micromol/l) and TGs (&gt;2.26 mmol/l) than among diabetic women with lower levels (22 vs 10%, p log-rank test=0.049) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Diabetic women with a higher level of only Lp(a) or TGs had a similar (14%) risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate model, diabetic women with higher levels of Lp(a) and TGs had an RR of 2.46 (95% CI 1.21-5.01) for developing CHD, as compared with those with lower levels of both biomarkers (p for interaction=0.413) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The RRs for women with a higher level of either Lp(a) (RR=1.22, 95% CI 0.77-1.92) or TGs (RR=1.39, 95% CI 0.78-2.42) were comparable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Increased levels of Lp(a) were independently associated with risk of CHD among diabetic women </plain></SENT>
