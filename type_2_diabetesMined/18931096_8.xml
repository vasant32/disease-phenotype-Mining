<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Although suboptimal glycemic control is known to be common in diabetic adults, few studies have evaluated factors at the level of the physician-patient encounter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to identify novel visit-based factors associated with intensification of oral <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> medications in diabetic adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a nonconcurrent prospective cohort study of 121 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> (A1C &gt; or =8%) enrolled in an academically affiliated managed-care program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Over a 24-month interval (1999-2001), we identified 574 hyperglycemic visits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We measured treatment intensification and factors associated with intensification at each visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Provider-patient dyads intensified oral <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treatment in only 128 (22%) of 574 hyperglycemic visits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As expected, worse glycemia was an important predictor of intensification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment was more likely to be intensified for patients with visits that were "routine" (odds ratio [OR] 2.55 [95% CI 1.49-4.38]), for patients taking two or more oral <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> drugs (2.82 [1.74-4.56]), or for patients with longer intervals between visits (OR per 30 days 1.05 [1.00-1.10]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, patients with less recent A1C measurements (OR &gt;30 days before the visit 0.53 [0.34-0.85]), patients with a higher number of prior visits (OR per prior visit 0.94 [0.88-1.00]), and African American patients (0.59 [0.35-1.00]) were less likely to have treatment intensified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Failure to intensify oral <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treatment is common in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Quality improvement measures in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> should focus on overcoming inertia, improving continuity of care, and reducing racial disparities </plain></SENT>
