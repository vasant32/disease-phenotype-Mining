<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the individual impact of initial responses in urinary albumin excretion (UAE) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> receptor blocker (ARB) treatment on long-term renal outcome in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a post hoc analysis of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5959">Irbesartan</z:chebi> in Patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>Microalbuminuria</z:mp> (IRMA)-2 trial we first assessed the individual variability in UAE and SBP response (0-6 months) in 531 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, we analyzed the individual effect of both response parameters on renal outcome defined as change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) during 2 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median reductions in UAE and SBP in the population were -18% and -11 mmHg, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5959">irbesartan</z:chebi>-treated patients, 85 (24.4%) had a robust (&gt;median) reduction in UAE but not in SBP (discordant SBP response) and 67 (19.3%) had a robust (&gt;median) reduction in SBP but not in UAE (discordant UAE response) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The degree of reduction in UAE was independently associated with the rate of eGFR decline (P = 0.0037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SBP showed a similar trend (P = 0.087) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The relation between a larger UAE reduction and a slower rate of renal function decline was present in both cohorts with a SBP change above and below the median </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Within an individual, UAE response to ARB therapy may be discordant from SBP response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The initial change in UAE was independently associated with eGFR slope; the more UAE reduction the less eGFR decline, irrespective of the SBP change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that in microalbuminuric patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, UAE should be monitored after initiation of therapy and a separate target for renoprotective therapy </plain></SENT>
