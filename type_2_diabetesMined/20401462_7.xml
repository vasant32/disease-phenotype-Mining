<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a population-based twin cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Monozygotic (n = 4,076) and dizygotic (n = 9,109) non-diabetic twin pairs born before 1958 answered a questionnaire in 1975, from which BMI was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Information on incident cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was obtained by linkage to nationwide registers until 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Altogether, 1,332 twins (6.3% of men, 5.1% of women) developed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The HR for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> increased monotonically with a mean of 1.22 (95% CI 1.20-1.24) per BMI unit and of 1.97 (95% CI 1.87-2.08) per SD of BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The HRs for lean, overweight, <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and morbidly <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> participants were 0.59, 2.96, 6.80 and 13.64 as compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> weight participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Model heritability estimates for bivariate variance due to an additive genetic component and non-shared environmental component were 75% (men) and 71% (women) for BMI, and 73% and 64%, respectively for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The correlations between genetic variance components (r (g)) indicated that one fifth of the covariance of BMI and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was due to shared genetic influences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although the mean monozygotic concordance for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was approximately twice the dizygotic one, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> within twin pair members varied greatly, irrespective of zygosity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: A 28-year follow-up of adult Finnish twins showed that despite high trait heritability estimates, only a fraction of covariation in BMI and incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was of genetic origin </plain></SENT>
