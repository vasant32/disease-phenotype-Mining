<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study was designed as a cross-sectional investigation with 721 men and 1,421 women, who were aged between 30 and 72 years and were randomly sampled from Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon) in Vietnam </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 75 g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test to assess fasting and 2 h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations were determined for each individual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> diagnostic criteria were used to determine the prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>WHR and blood pressure were also measured in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 10.8% in men and 11.7% in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Higher WHR and blood pressure were independently associated with a greater risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with participants without central <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, the odds of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was increased by 6.4-fold (95% CI 3.2-13.0) in men and 4.1-fold (2.2-7.6) in women with central <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two nomograms were developed that help identify men and women at high risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The current prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the Vietnamese population is high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Simple field measurements such as waist-to-hip ratio and systolic blood pressure can identify individuals at high risk of undiagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
