<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although several experiments using pancreatic β-cell lines have shown that the ligands of nuclear hormone receptors modulate insulin secretion, it is not clear whether RXRs have any role in insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: To elucidate the function of RXRs in pancreatic β-cells, we generated a double-transgenic mouse in which a dominant-negative form of RXRβ was inducibly expressed in pancreatic β-cells using the Tet-On system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also established a pancreatic β-cell line from an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021670" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">insulinoma</z:e> caused by the β-cell-specific expression of simian virus 40 T antigen in the above transgenic mouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the transgenic mouse, expression of the dominant-negative RXR enhanced the insulin secretion with high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the pancreatic β-cell line, the suppression of RXRs also enhanced <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion at a high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration, while 9-cis-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi>, an RXR <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, repressed it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>High-density oligonucleotide microarray analysis showed that expression of the dominant-negative RXR affected the expression levels of a number of genes, some of which have been implicated in the function and/or differentiation of β-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that endogenous RXR negatively regulates the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Given these findings, we propose that the modulation of endogenous RXR in β-cells may be a new therapeutic approach for improving <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948379" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">impaired insulin secretion</z:e> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
