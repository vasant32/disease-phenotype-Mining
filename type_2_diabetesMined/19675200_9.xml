<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relation between total fish, type of fish (lean and fatty), and eicosapentaenoic acid (<z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36005">docosahexaenoic acid</z:chebi> (DHA) intake and risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a population-based cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The analysis included 4,472 Dutch participants aged &gt;or=55 years without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dietary intake was assessed with a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hazard ratios (relative risk [RR]) with 95% CIs were used to examine risk associations adjusted for age, sex, lifestyle, and nutritional factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 15 years of follow-up, 463 participants developed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median fish intake, mainly lean fish (81%), was 10 g/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Total fish intake was associated positively with risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; the RR was 1.32 (95% CI 1.02-1.70) in the highest total fish group (&gt;or=28 g/day) compared with that for non-fish eaters (P(trend) = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Correspondingly, lean fish intake tended to be associated positively with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (RR highest group [&gt;or=23 g/day] 1.30 [95% CI 1.01-1.68]; P(trend) = 0.06), but fatty fish was not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No association was observed between <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> and DHA intake and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (RR highest group [&gt;or=149.4 mg/day] 1.22 [0.97-1.53]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With additional adjustment for intake of <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi>, cholesterol, and <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi>, this RR decreased to 1.05 (0.80-1.38; P(trend) = 0.77) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The findings do not support a beneficial effect of total fish, type of fish, or <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> and DHA intake on the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, other dietary components, such as <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi>, and unmeasured contaminants present in fish might explain our results </plain></SENT>
