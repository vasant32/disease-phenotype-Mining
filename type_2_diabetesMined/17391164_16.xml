<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Drug-naive individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, body mass index (BMI) of &gt; or =27 and &lt;50 kg/m(2) and <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c) (HbA(1c)) of &lt;10.5% were enrolled into the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the individuals participated in a non-pharmacologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> program (Pathways to Change((R)); Johnson &amp; Johnson Healthcare Systems, Piscataway, NJ, USA) throughout the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After a 6-week placebo run-in, the subjects were randomized to placebo, topiramate 96 mg/day or topiramate 192 mg/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects were scheduled for 8-week titration and 52-week maintenance phases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study was ended early; efficacy data were reported for a predefined modified intent-to-treat (MITT) population (n = 229), with 40 weeks of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the subjects who provided any safety data were included in the safety population (n = 535) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Baseline mean weight was 103.7 kg, BMI 36 kg/m(2) and HbA(1c) 6.7% across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By the end of week 40, the placebo, the topiramate 96 mg/day and topiramate 192 mg/day groups lost 2.5, 6.6 and 9.1% of their baseline body weight respectively (p &lt; 0.001 vs. placebo, MITT population using last observation carried forward) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The decrease in HbA(1c) was 0.2, 0.6 and 0.7% respectively (p &lt; 0.001 vs. placebo, MITT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Topiramate significantly <z:mp ids='MP_0002843'>reduced blood pressure</z:mp> and urinary albumin excretion; a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight-loss</z:hpo>-independent HbA(1c) improving effect of topiramate was demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Adverse events were predominantly related to central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Topiramate as an add-on treatment to lifestyle improvements produced significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and improved <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, drug-naive subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These treatment advantages should be balanced against the occurrence of adverse events in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
