<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Different degrees of beta-cell failure and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> are present in type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been recently suggested that high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced beta-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> shares a final common pathway with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, involving interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) production by beta-cells, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> via Fas-FasL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to test whether human islet exposure to high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in vitro, or to the type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> environment in vivo, induces IL-1beta expression and consequent activation of NF-kappaB-dependent genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Human islets were isolated from five normoglycemic organ donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The islets were cultured for 48 h to 7 days at 5.6, 11, or 28 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For comparative purposes, islets were also exposed to IL-1beta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Gene <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression levels were assessed by real-time RT-PCR in a blinded fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Culture of the human islets at 11 and 28 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> induced a four- to fivefold increase in medium insulin as compared with 5.6 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, but neither IL-1beta nor IL-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> (IL-1ra) expression changed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IL-1beta and IL-1ra protein release to the medium was also unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Stimulated human monocytes, studied in parallel, released &gt;50-fold more IL-1beta than the islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was also no <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced islet Fas expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Expression of the NF-kappaB-dependent genes IkappaB-alpha and monocyte chemoattractant protein (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>)-1 was induced in human islets by IL-1beta but not by high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In a second set of experiments, human islets were isolated from seven type 2 diabetic patients and eight control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The findings on <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were essentially the same as in the in vitro experiments, namely the in vivo diabetic state did not induce IL-1beta, Fas, or <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 expression in human islets, and also did not modify IL-1ra expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The present findings suggest that high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in vitro, or the diabetic milieu in vivo, does not induce IL-1beta production or NF-kappaB activation in human islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This makes it unlikely that locally produced IL-1beta is an important mediator of glucotoxicity to human islets and argues against the IL-1beta-NF-kappaB-Fas pathway as a common mediator for beta-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
