<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Elevated plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> concentration is a component of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> syndrome and is commonly associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of our study was to perform a genome-wide linkage scan to identify genetic regions that influence variation in plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels in families that are enriched with individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used phenotypic and genotypic data from 1,026 individuals distributed across 294 Mexican-American families, who were ascertained for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, from the Veterans Administration Genetic Epidemiology Study (VAGES) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> values were transformed, and a variance-components technique was used to conduct multipoint linkage analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After adjusting for the significant effects of sex and BMI, heritability for plasma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> was estimated as 46 +/- 7% (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multipoint linkage analysis yielded the strongest evidence for linkage of plasma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> near marker D12S391 on chromosome 12p (logarithm of odds [LOD] = 2.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our linkage signal on chromosome 12p provides independent replication of a similar finding in another Mexican-American sample from the San Antonio Family <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study (SAFDS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Combined multipoint linkage analysis of the VAGES and SAFDS data yielded significant evidence for linkage of plasma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> to a genetic location between markers GATA49D12 and D12S391 on 12p (LOD = 3.8, empirical P value = 2.0 x 10(-5)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This region on 12p harbors the gene-encoding adiponectin receptor 2 (AdipoR2), where we previously have shown that multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms are associated with plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> concentrations in the SAFDS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we provided suggestive evidence in favor of association for rs929434 with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> concentrations in the VAGES </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these results provide strong evidence for a major locus on chromosome 12p that influences plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels in Mexican Americans </plain></SENT>
