<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The world is facing an epidemic of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, with populations in low- to middle-income countries, including many in the Asia Pacific (AP) region, being disproportionately affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Emerging data identify postprandial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> (PPHG) as an important predictor of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>, and several professional bodies, including the International <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Federation, have issued guidelines on the management of PPHG in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Guidance on how international recommendations could be implemented in Asian populations is currently lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a panel of experts from the AP region convened to consider the current status of PPHG and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> in the region, and to develop recommendations for clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The group concluded that improved awareness of the impact of PPHG on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk, among clinicians and the general public, and more widespread use of routine screening for PPHG, using oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance testing in those without recognised <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, are required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, frequent meal-based testing and effective PPHG management are essential to the management of IGT and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
