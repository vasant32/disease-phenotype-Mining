<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: The adipocyte-secreted hormone resistin has been implicated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but pharmacological and dietary factors that regulate resistin gene expression and the effects of resistin on cellular <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake in muscle have not been clearly defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Expression of resistin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was studied in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes by using real-time semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effects of resistin on insulin-stimulated and insulin-independent 2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15866">deoxyglucose</z:chebi> uptake were evaluated in L6 muscle cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Insulin 1 microm and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> 10 microm markedly reduced resistin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression (relative to the control gene TF2D) by 4.7-fold (p &lt; 0.05) and 5.3-fold (p &lt; 0.02), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similar reductions in resistin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were demonstrated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> 100 microm (6.2-fold reduction, p &lt; 0.02) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16196">oleic acid</z:chebi> 100 microm (3.9-fold reduction, p &lt; 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Resistin 1 microm significantly reduced maximum insulin-stimulated 2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15866">deoxyglucose</z:chebi> uptake in L6 cells from 634 to 383% (relative to 100% for control, p &lt; 0.001), and co-administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> had no effect on resistin-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the absence of insulin, however, resistin increased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake dose-dependently (e.g., 1.75-fold at 5 microm, p &lt; 0.001) via a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase-dependent pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that various <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering therapies and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16196">oleic acid</z:chebi> reduce resistin gene expression in isolated adipocytes, and that resistin impairs insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake in skeletal muscle-derived cells </plain></SENT>
