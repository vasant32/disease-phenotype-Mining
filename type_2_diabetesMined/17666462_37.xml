<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These patients were at high risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, so any therapeutic benefit could potentially be offset by risk of associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> cases to assess the effects of treatment on morbidity and mortality after reports of serious <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: PROactive was an outcome study in 5,238 patients randomized to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with New York Heart Association Class II-IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> at screening were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A serious adverse event of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> was defined as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> that required hospitalization or prolonged a hospitalization stay, was fatal or life threatening, or resulted in persistent significant disability or incapacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>Heart failure</z:hpo> risk was evaluated by multivariate regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: More <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (5.7%) than placebo patients (4.1%) had a serious <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> event during the study (P = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, mortality due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> was similar (25 of 2,605 [0.96%] for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> vs. 22 of 2,633 [0.84%] for placebo; P = 0.639) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among patients with a serious <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> event, subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality was proportionately lower with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (40 of 149 [26.8%] vs. 37 of 108 [34.3%] with placebo; P = 0.1338) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Proportionately fewer <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> patients with serious <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> went on to have an event in the primary (47.7% with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> vs. 57.4% with placebo; P = 0.0593) or main secondary end point (34.9% with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> vs. 47.2% with placebo; P = 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although the incidence of serious <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> was increased with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> versus placebo in the total PROactive population of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and macrovascular disease, subsequent mortality or morbidity was not increased in patients with serious <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
