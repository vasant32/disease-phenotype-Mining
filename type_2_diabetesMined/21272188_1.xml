<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to determine the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dose-response effects of insulin in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We included eight insulin-resistant (mean insulin dose: 186 IU/day; body mass index: 35) subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a single-blinded, randomized crossover study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each subject was studied on two occasions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On each occasion, subjects underwent two 3-h hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The subjects were randomized to two low-dose insulin infusions (0.5 and 1.5 mU/kg/min in random order) on one occasion and to two high-dose insulin infusions (3.0 and 5.0 mU/kg/min in random order) on another occasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> occasions, steady-state <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion rates (SSGIRs) were accomplished and we observed a clear dose-response relationship with GIR values of 0.4 ± 0.2 (s.e.), 2.6 ± 0.6, 3.7 ± 0.8 and 4.9 ± 0.9 mg/kg/min during the 0.5, 1.5, 3.0 and 5.0 mU/kg/min insulin infusions, respectively (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Likewise, there was a dose-dependent suppression of endogenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production (EGP) (p &lt; 0.009), plasma free fatty acids (FFAs) (p &lt; 0.001) and plasma glucagon (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the insulin dose response in terms of GIR and EGP is preserved for insulin doses corresponding to &gt;800 IU/day, suggesting effectiveness of very high insulin doses in severely insulin-resistant subjects </plain></SENT>
