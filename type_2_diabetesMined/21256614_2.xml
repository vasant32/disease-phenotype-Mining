<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to examine the association between eNOS intron 4 VNTR polymorphism and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in an Iranian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 220 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 96 healthy control subjects were recruited from the same area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genotyping was performed using PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significant difference was found in genotype frequencies of eNOS polymorphism between patients and controls (aa+ab vs. bb p=0.02, OR 2.0 95% CI; 1.05-3.96) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also allele a frequency was significantly increased in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with controls (p=0.007, OR 2.1 95% CI; 1.19-4.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found that in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011882" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic neuropathy</z:e> the frequency of 'a' allele was significantly increased compared to the controls p=0.03, OR=1.8 95% CI (1.00-3.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both genotype and allele frequencies were significantly different between patients who were complication free compared to the controls [aa+ab vs. bb p=0.007, OR=2.6 95% CI (1.2-5.8) and p=0.001, OR=2.8 95% CI (1.4-5.9)] respectively with the a allele conferring the risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The association between eNOS VNTR polymorphism and T2DM seems to be stronger in patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> indicating diverse effect of eNOS polymorphism on <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and diabetic microvascular complications </plain></SENT>
