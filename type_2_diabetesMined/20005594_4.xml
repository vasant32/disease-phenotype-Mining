<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of our study was to evaluate the prevalence of NDRD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A retrospective analysis was performed on diabetic patients who had undergone renal biopsy during a 6-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our study revealed a high prevalence of NDRD in the diabetic population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixty-nine patients were investigated, 52.2% were diagnosed as NDRD and 47.8% as DN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000097'>Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis</z:hpo> was the most common lesion found in patients with NDRD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found a relationship between DN and fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, LVMI, intima-media thickening (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>), and the presence of carotid plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with NDRD had a lower incidence of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (DR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The absence of DR to differentiate NDRD had a sensitivity of 72.7%, a specificity 91.7%, and an ROC=0.822 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level had a sensitivity and specificity of 93.9% and 75%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the use of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> had sensitivity and specificity of 90% and 75.8%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In this study, we determined that the absence of DR, a lower fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> is useful in differentiating NDRD from DN in diabetic patients with overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
