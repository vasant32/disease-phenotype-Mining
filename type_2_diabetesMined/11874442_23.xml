<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To address this, we designed a randomized, prospective clinical trial to study the efficacy and safety of 10 mg sibutramine twice daily (bid), and compare this treatment with 120 mg orlistat three times daily (tid) and 850 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (bid) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 150 female patients with body mass index (b.m.i.) &gt; 30 kg/m(2) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The subjects were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> out-patients at the Ba≈ükent University Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each individual was assigned randomly to receive 10 mg sibutramine bid (group 1; n = 50; mean age 42.27 +/- 1.40 years), 120 mg orlistat tid (group 2; n = 50; mean age 42.13 +/- 1.32 years) or 850 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> bid (group 3; n = 50; mean age 43.58 +/- 1.40 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients took the medications for 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients from the sibutramine group and two from the orlistat group were withdrawn from the study because of side-effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 6 months of treatment, the sibutramine, orlistat, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> groups <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> showed significantly reduced b.m.i </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>(13.57%, 9.06% and 9.90% respectively); waist circumference (10.43%, 6.64%, and 8.10% respectively); fasting and postprandial blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> as assessed by the homeostasis model for assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA) (38.63%, 32.73% and 39.28%, respectively); levels of total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDLC</z:chebi>) cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39027">very low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47773">VLDLC</z:chebi>) cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> (a), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B; <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> level; pulse rate; and systolic and diastolic blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>None of the groups showed any significant changes in levels of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDLC</z:chebi>) cholesterol, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> A1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was a significantly greater fall in b.m.i. in the sibutramine group than in either of the other groups (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study confirm that sibutramine, orlistat and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> effective and safe medications that reduce cardiovascular risk and can decrease the risk of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Overall, treatment with 10 mg sibutramine bid is more effective than orlistat or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> therapy in terms of weight reduction </plain></SENT>
