<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study is to examine the relationship of occupational, commuting and leisure-time physical activity with the incidence of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively followed 6898 Finnish men and 7392 women of 35 to 64 years of age without a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e>, or <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hazards ratios of incidence of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were estimated by levels of occupational, commuting, and leisure-time physical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 12 years, there were 373 incident cases of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In both men and women combined, the hazards ratios of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> associated with light, moderate and active work were 1.00, 0.70 and 0.74 (p=0.020 for trend) after adjustment for confounding factors (age, study year, sex, systolic blood pressure, smoking, education, the two other types of physical activity and BMI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The multivariate-adjusted hazards ratios of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with none, 1 to 29, and more than 30 min of walking or cycling to and from work were 1.00, 0.96, and 0.64 (p=0.048 for trend) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The multivariate-adjusted hazards ratios of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for low, moderate, high levels of leisure-time physical activity were 1.00, 0.67, and 0.61 (p=0.001 for trend); after additional adjustment for BMI, the hazards ratio was no longer significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Moderate and high occupational, commuting or leisure-time physical activity independently and significantly reduces risk of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among the middle-aged general population </plain></SENT>
