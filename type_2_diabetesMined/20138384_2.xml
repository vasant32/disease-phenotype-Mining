<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: 74 patients were randomized to the intervention (n=38) or control (n=36) group </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Physical activity levels at work or in leisure time were not modulated by the exercise prescription intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In accordance, no changes in body composition, glycemic control, medication use or risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Long-term behavioral intervention programs, providing individualized exercise prescription, are not sufficient to change sedentary behavior and/or improve glycemic control in insulin treated, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
