<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By measuring percent HbA1c in BDNF-treated and pair-fed animals, we show that the effects of BDNF on nonfasted blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels are not caused by decreased food intake but reflect a significant improvement in blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, once established, this effect can persist for weeks after cessation of BDNF treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests were performed to examine the effects of BDNF on blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control in the fasted state and after an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BDNF treatment normalized fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> from initially hyperglycemic levels and also showed evidence for beneficial, although less marked, effects on the ability to remove exogenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> from blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One means to lower fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> is to reduce the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> output of peripheral tissues that normally play a part in the maintenance of fasting <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because the liver is the major endogenous source of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in blood during fasting, and because hepatic weight and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> output are increased in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we evaluated the effects of BDNF on liver tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BDNF reduced the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002240'>hepatomegaly</z:hpo> present in db/db mice, in association with reduced liver <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> and reduced liver enzyme activity in serum, supporting the possible involvement of liver tissue in the mechanism of action for BDNF </plain></SENT>
