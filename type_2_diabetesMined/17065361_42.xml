<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently, case-control studies demonstrated that a TCF7L2 (transcription factor 7-like 2 gene) noncoding variant (rs7903146 T at-risk allele) was strongly associated with an increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the predictive value of this marker in a nonselected general population remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, our aim was to assess the contribution of this variant to the prevalence and incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> (type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>) and insulin regulation in a 9-year prospective study of 4,976 middle-aged participants in the French DESIR (Data from an Epidemiological Study on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin Resistance</z:hpo> Syndrome) cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our data support previous studies associating the T at-risk allele with a higher prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> at baseline (P = 0.049) and a higher incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> after 9 years of follow-up (P = 0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The population-attributable risk to develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> due to the T at-risk allele was estimated to be 10.4% at the end of the prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most likely <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> model was found to be additive (P = 0.002) rather than deviating from linearity (hazard ratio 1.21 [95% CI 1.05-1.39], P = 0.008) [corrected] An increase in the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> was confirmed by survival analyses among C/C, C/T, and T/T carriers during the 9 years of follow-up (P = 0.028 by log-rank test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, in control individuals, there was weak evidence of association of the T at-risk allele with reduced fasting insulin levels and insulin secretion index (homeostasis model assessment of beta-cell function) in control individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the TCF7L2 T at-risk allele variation (rs7903146) predicts <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> incidence in a general French population, possibly through a deleterious effect on insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
