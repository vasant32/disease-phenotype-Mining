<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We looked for potential associations between the diabetogenic VPS13C/C2CD4A/C2CD4B rs7172432 variant and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related intermediary traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We genotyped the rs7172432 variant in the population-based Inter99 cohort (n = 6,784) and analysed quantitative <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related traits in 5,722 non-diabetic participants who <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were examined by an OGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-associated A allele was associated with 0.60 cm higher waist circumference (p = 0.004), 0.037 mmol/l higher fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (p = 4 × 10(-5)) and 0.11 mmol/l higher plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> at 30 min during an OGTT (p = 4 × 10(-4)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In analyses adjusted for concomitant insulin sensitivity levels the diabetogenic allele was associated with a lower <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin response (GSIR) as estimated by 30 min serum insulin (β = -0.039, p = 2 × 10(-7)), insulinogenic index (β = -0.057, p = 1 × 10(-8)) and BIGTT-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin release (β = -0.041, p = 9 × 10(-9)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As rs7172432 is situated in a region previously associated with glycaemic traits, we tested linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the reported regional lead single-nucleotide polymorphisms for fasting (rs11071657) and 2 h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (rs17271305), and performed conditional analyses of rs7172432 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rs7172432 showed moderate LD with rs11071657 and rs17271305 (R (2) &lt; 0.34) and we found strong association by almost unchanged effect sizes of rs7172432 with plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and estimates of GSIR in analyses conditional on rs11071657 and rs17271305 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The diabetogenic VPS13C/C2CD4A/C2CD4B rs7172432 A allele associates with GSIR in non-diabetic individuals from the general population, suggesting an impaired beta cell function as an intermediary <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related trait </plain></SENT>
