<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to morphologically and functionally characterise primary MECs purified and cultured from human islets, and to establish a simian virus 40 (SV40)-immortalised cell line from these primary cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human islet MECs were extracted and purified using anti-CD105 coated immunomagnetic beads, and endothelial markers and surface molecules analysed by flow cytometric analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An immortalised cell line was then established by using a chimeric adeno5/SV40 virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Islet MECs expressed classic and specific endothelial markers, a high basal level of intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1, and low levels of E-selectin and TNF (previously known as TNF-alpha) inducible vascular cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IFNG (previously known as IFN-gamma) induced expression of HLA class II molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The immortalised islet MECs expanded rapidly, exhibited increased DNA synthesis, and were passaged approximately 30 times, without signs of senescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They retained the endothelial characteristics of the parental cells, and behaved as the primary cells in terms of TNF stimulation of expression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules and support of leucocyte <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> and transmigration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The immortalised islet MECs that we have established could effectively represent a substitute for primary counterparts for in vitro studies on the role of the microvasculature in pathophysiological processes involved in type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
