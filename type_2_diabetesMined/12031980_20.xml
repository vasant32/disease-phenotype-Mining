<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is well described that excessive <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism can cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in both animals and humans, and this has been implicated as a causative factor in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, we have shown that intravenous <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> emulsion (liposyn) infusion during a 120-min euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp led to significant reductions in insulin action and fatty acid translocase (FAT/CD36) skeletal muscle protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After reviewing the literature, it became evident that essentially <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> past studies, including our own, were conducted in male animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, to determine whether there were sex determinants of fat-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, we assessed the impact of free fatty acid (FFA) elevation on insulin action in female rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we report that a fourfold elevation in plasma FFA concentration induced a 40% reduction in the insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal rate, a 30% decline in insulin-stimulated skeletal muscle insulin substrate receptor-1 (IRS-1) phosphorylation, a 48% decrease in IRS-1-associated phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase activity, and a 50% reduction in muscle FAT/CD36 protein expression in male rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In striking contrast, we found no effect of FFA elevation to cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, changes in IRS-1/PI 3-kinase, or FAT/CD36 protein levels in female animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that female animals are protected from <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-induced reductions in insulin action </plain></SENT>
