<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine whether baseline pulse pressure (PP), a marker of arterial stiffness, is associated with subsequent development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 350 type 2 diabetic patients, who were free from AF at baseline, were followed for 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A standard electrocardiogram was performed annually and a diagnosis of incident AF was confirmed in affected participants by a single cardiologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the follow-up, 32 patients (9.1% of total) developed incident AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After adjustments for age, sex, BMI, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration, presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> treatment, kidney dysfunction, and pre-existing history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, and mild valvular disease, baseline PP was associated with an increased incidence of AF (adjusted odds ratio 1.76 for each SD increment [95% CI 1.1-2.8]; P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that increased PP independently predicts incident AF in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
