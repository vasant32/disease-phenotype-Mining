<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We systematically reviewed the literature by means of a meta-analysis and investigated sources of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in results of different studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The summary risk ratio, based on 3408 cases and 5419 control cases from 27 studies, was 1.25 (95% CI 1.05-1.48) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results, however, differed according to the type of study, method of verifying non-diabetic status of the control subjects, and age of the case subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Population-based studies reported lower odds ratios than hospital-based studies (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.74-1.30 vs OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.17-1.74) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also, the diagnostic test to exclude <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> amongst control subjects interacted with the association between the IRS-1 Gly972Arg variant and Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (p=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, the odds ratio reduced with increasing age ( p=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: Overall, carriers of the 972Arg variant of the IRS-1 gene are at a 25% increased risk of having Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with non-carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The odds ratios are generally higher in hospital-based studies, including relatively young, symptomatic, cases </plain></SENT>
