<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> leads to a more rapid decline in functional status among older Mexican Americans with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to examine the impact of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on change in self-reported functional status over a 2-year period among older Mexican Americans with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed a longitudinal analysis with repeated measurements of functional limitations in a cohort of Mexican Americans aged &gt; or =60 years in the Sacramento Area Latino Study on Aging (SALSA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> was diagnosed on the basis of self-report of physician diagnosis, medication use, and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Functional status was measured by assessment of activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) at baseline and 1 and 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 1,789 SALSA participants, 585 (33%) had <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Diabetic subjects reported 74% more limitations than nondiabetic subjects in ADL (summary score for number of limitations, 0.99 vs. 0.57; P = 0.002) and 50% more limitations in IADL (summary score for number of limitations, 7.83 vs. 5.25; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The annual rate of increase in limitations of ADL and IADL was 0.046 and 0.033 (log scale) on each scale among diabetic subjects compared with 0.013 and 0.003 (log scale) among nondiabetic subjects (P &lt; 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Complications of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were found to increase ADL and IADL limitations among diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Longer duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was also associated with an increase in ADL and IADL limitations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There was lower baseline functional status and a more rapid decline in functional status among older Mexican Americans with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> versus those without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
