<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To investigate the involvement of islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (IAPP) and amyloid deposits in the pathophysiology of this disease, we studied the relationship between IAPP-derived <z:mpath ids='MPATH_34'>amyloid deposition</z:mpath> and the clinical features in type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined pancreata obtained from 37 type 2 diabetic subjects and 12 non-diabetic ones by immunohistochemical techniques using two specific antibodies to IAPP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IAPP-derived deposits occurred in 1 of the 12 (8.3%) non-diabetic subjects and 28 of the 37 (75.7%) diabetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When diabetic patients were divided into categories according to the presence of the deposits, the duration of the disease was significantly longer in patients with amyloid than that in the patients without it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> of at least 14-years-duration to the deposition was significantly high, and a body weight of at least 120% maximal ideal body weight was relatively high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, IAPP-derived <z:mpath ids='MPATH_34'>amyloid deposition</z:mpath> increases along with the duration of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> may further enhance these deposits, hence hypersecretion of IAPP may be involved in the progression of this disease </plain></SENT>
