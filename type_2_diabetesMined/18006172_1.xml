<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Type 2 diabetic subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ABI were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The risk factors for PVD and ABI were examined before and after the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 107 type 2 diabetic subjects completed the assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on the change of ABI, the study subjects were divided into two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty subjects, in Group 1, had a decrease in ABI; 67 subjects, in Group 2, had no decrease in ABI after the 3-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The baseline total-to-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> ratio (4.5+/-1.2 vs. 3.9+/-1.0, P=0.018) and serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> (99.0+/-18.0micromol/L vs. 88.8+/-15.7micromol/L, P=0.004) were significantly higher, and the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> concentration was significantly lower (1.11+/-0.26mmol/L vs. 1.27+/-0.39mmol/L, P=0.011) in Group 1 than in Group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, total-to-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> ratio was the variable showed an inverse correlation and independent predictor for the change in ABI after the 3-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Total-to-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> ratio is a major risk factor for PVD and showed an inverse trend to change in ABI in Asian type 2 diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
