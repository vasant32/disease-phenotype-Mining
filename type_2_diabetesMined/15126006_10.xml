<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The C677T variant of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25297">methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase (MTHFR) gene, one of the key enzymes catalyzing remethylation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi>, may play a role in the development of not only <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> but also <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025945" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic microangiopathies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the distribution of the MTHFR genotypes in the Chinese population and the association between the C677T variant and diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 220 unrelated patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and 130 controls were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The MTHFR genotype was analyzed by PCR followed by HinfI digestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 130 healthy control subjects, the frequency of the mutant T allele was 30.0%, comparable to that of a Hong Kong (Chinese) population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The distribution of the three genotypes was as follows: TT genotype, 16.9%; CT genotype, 26.2%; and CC genotype, 56.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This genotype distribution did not differ between control subjects and type 2 diabetic patients in which 19.1% were TT, 34.5% were CT and 46.4% were CC (2=3.85, P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the mutant T allele was 42.3% in diabetic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> (n=124) versus 28.6% in those without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> (n=96) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The genotype frequencies were TT, 21.0%; CT, 42.7%; CC, 36.3% in diabetic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> versus TT, 16.7%; CT, 23.9%; CC, 59.4% in those without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The MTHFR genotype and allele frequencies were different between diabetic patients with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> (chi2=12.27, P&lt;0.005; chi2=8.77, P&lt;0.005, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Moreover, plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels were markedly higher in individuals with TT genotype than those with CC or CT genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The C677T mutation of MTHFR gene is common in the Chinese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>MTHFR C677T gene polymorphism associated with a predisposition to increased plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels may represent a genetic risk factor for diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in Chinese type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
