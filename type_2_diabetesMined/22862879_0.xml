<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data from 19,184 DPP-4 (mean age: 64 years; 56% males) and 31,110 SU users (69 years; 51%) with new prescriptions (index date), without additional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetics</z:chebi> except <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, in 1201 general practises in Germany were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therapy discontinuation (prescription gap &gt;90 days), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> [International Classification of Diseases (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-10)] and macrovascular outcomes (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-10) (2-year follow-up) were compared adjusting for age, sex, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e>, health insurance, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020473" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperlipidaemia</z:e>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensives</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering and antithrombotic drugs, microvascular complications and Charlson co-morbidity score using logistic or Cox regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two years after index date, DDP-4 (non-persistence: 39%) were associated with a lower risk of discontinuation compared to SU (49%) [adjusted hazard ratio (HR): 0.74; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.71-0.76] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hypoglycaemias</z:e> (â‰¥1) were documented in 0.18% patients with DPP-4 and in 1.00% with SU [odds ratio (OR): 0.21; 95%CI: 0.08-0.57] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hypoglycaemias</z:e> were significantly associated with incident macrovascular complications (HR: 1.6; 95% CI: 1.1-2.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Risk of macrovascular events was 26% lower in DPP-4 than in SU users </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Lack of persistence with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> therapy is frequently found in primary care patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DPP-4 was associated with lower therapy discontinuation and a fivefold reduced frequency of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> compared to SU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The low absolute numbers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemias</z:e> are most likely due to the fact that only severe events were documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DPP-4 treatment was associated with reduced incidence of macrovascular events relative to SU in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients in primary care practises </plain></SENT>
