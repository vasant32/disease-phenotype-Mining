<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The transition of an individual from normoglycemia to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> has generally been thought to involve either moderate or rapid changes in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> over time, although few studies have analyzed these changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine whether a general pattern of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> change exists in most individuals who become diabetic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We examined longitudinal data from Pima Indians who developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after several biennial examinations to characterize changes in 2-h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A distinct pattern of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> change was apparent in the time course of most individuals, an initial linear trend followed by a steeper rise in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A model consisting of additive linear and exponential functions was hypothesized to account for this pattern and was tested for goodness of fit on 55 individuals who became diabetic after at least 10 previous examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The combined linear and exponential model provided a significantly better fit than linear or exponential models alone in 40 of the 55 cases (P &lt; 10(-38)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using this model, the timeframe over which <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> values rose suddenly was estimated, having a median time to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of &lt;4.5 years from the time at which the exponential effect had contributed a modest increase of 10 mg/dl to the initial linear trend </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that there are two distinct processes affecting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels in most individuals who progress to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and that the rapid <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> rise identified in these people may be an important period for physiologic and preventive research </plain></SENT>
