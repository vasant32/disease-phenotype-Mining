<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a retrospective US cohort study with a 2-year follow-up period after diagnosis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using the General Electric Healthcare's Clinical Data Services electronic medical record database, eligible patients included those aged ≥30 years at initial diagnosis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> between January 2003 and December 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the 2-year period following diagnosis, the time to the first prescription of an oral antihyperglycaemic agent was compared between younger (30-64 years) and older (≥65 years) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Factors associated with time to treatment with an oral antihyperglycaemic agent were examined using Cox proportional hazards regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 10 743 patients with newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 43% were ≥65 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean age at diagnosis was 73 years for older patients and 52 years for younger patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared to younger patients, a greater proportion of older patients had a baseline <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA1c) value &lt;7% (38 vs. 32%; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the 2-year follow-up period, a significantly greater proportion of younger patients (59%) received oral antihyperglycaemic treatment compared to older patients (44%; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median time between diagnosis and initiating treatment with an oral antihyperglycaemic agent was 350 days for younger patients and &gt;2 years for older patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for covariates, older patients had a greater risk of not receiving treatment with oral antihyperglycaemic therapy than younger patients [adjusted hazard ratio = 0.82 (95% confidence interval: 0.75, 0.90)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the time to initiation of oral antihyperglycaemic therapy was significantly longer in older patients (≥65 years old) than younger patients (&lt;65 years) </plain></SENT>
