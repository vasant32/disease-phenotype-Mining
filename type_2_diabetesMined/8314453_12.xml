<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recombinant human insulin-like growth factor-I which mimics many effects of insulin, decreased insulin, total and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47776">VLDL-triglyceride</z:chebi>, and total and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> levels in healthy man as well as <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin levels in Type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We, therefore, investigated total and fractionated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> and cholesterol levels, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>(a), non-esterified fatty acid, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> levels in eight Type 2 diabetic patients during five control, five treatment, and three wash-out days </plain></SENT>
