<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE The increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> in pregnancy is mediated by deterioration of their β-cell function, which occurs as early as the first year postpartum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We thus sought to identify early determinants of their declining ��-cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Women with recent gestational <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> (166) underwent oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test at 3 and 12 months postpartum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were stratified into those in whom β-cell function (Insulin Secretion-Sensitivity Index-2 [ISSI-2]) declined over this time (decliners; n = 92) and those in whom it did not (nondecliners; n = 74) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS Between 3 and 12 months, hepatic insulin sensitivity (1/homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> [HOMA-IR]) decreased in decliners but not in nondecliners </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Over this time, the change in 1/HOMA-IR emerged as an independent predictor of the change in ISSI-2 (t = 5.5; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increased hepatic insulin sensitivity independently predicted a lower likelihood of declining β-cell function (odds ratio = 0.13 [95% CI 0.06-0.29]; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS Hepatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> is an early determinant of declining β-cell function after gestational dysglycemia </plain></SENT>
