<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Long-acting insulin analogs provide relatively peakless and more physiologic insulin replacement therapy than neutral protaminated Hagedorn insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently 2 new basal insulin analogs have been developed with superior pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics properties; insulin degludec and a pegylated insulin lispro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These agents are generally well tolerated and have been evaluated in both type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this article we review the results of clinical trials assessing the efficacy, safety and tolerability of these newer longer-acting insulin analogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In general rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> in these trials were low, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control was comparable to currently available basal insulin analogs, and rates of nocturnal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> were significantly and substantially lower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While further study will be required, advances in basal insulin replacement may offer important advantages over existing options for starting insulin strategies </plain></SENT>
