<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether treatment with insulin in recently diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is advantageous compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Beta-cell function, glycemic control, and quality of life were monitored over 2 years in 39 patients with islet cell antibody-negative type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosed 0-2 years before inclusion in a Swedish multicenter randomized clinical trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomized to either two daily injections of premixed 30% soluble and 70% <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> (3.5-10.5 mg daily) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-glucagon tests were performed yearly in duplicate after 2-3 days of temporary withdrawal of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 1 year the glucagon-stimulated C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> response was increased in the insulin-treated group by 0.14 +/- 0.08 nmol/l, whereas it was decreased by 0.12 +/- 0.08 nmol/l in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> group, P &lt; 0.02 for difference between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 2 years, fasting insulin levels were higher after treatment withdrawal in the insulin-treated versus the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi>-treated group (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HbA(1c) levels decreased significantly during the first year in both groups; however, at the end of the second year, HbA(1c) had deteriorated in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> group (P &lt; 0.01), but not in the insulin-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The difference in evolution of HbA(1c) during the second year was significant between groups, P &lt; 0.02 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A questionnaire indicated no difference in well-being related to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Early insulin versus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> treatment in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> temporarily prolongs endogenous insulin secretion and promotes better metabolic control </plain></SENT>
