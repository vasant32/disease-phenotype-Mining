<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diabetic patients were under 110% ideal body weight, had no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0259749" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autonomic neuropathy</z:e> and were well controlled (HbA1, 7.1 +/- 0.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After the diabetic patients were kept euglycaemic by an overnight insulin infusion, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> was induced in both groups by intravenous insulin at 30 mU.m-2.min-1 for 60 min and counterregulatory responses measured for 150 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between diabetic patients and control subjects in the rate of fall (3.3 +/- 0.3 vs 4.0 +/- 0.3 mmol.l-1.h-1), nadir (2.4 +/- 0.2 vs 2.3 +/- 0.1 mmol/l) and rate of recovery (0.027 +/- 0.002 vs 0.030 +/- 0.003 mmol.l-1.min-1) of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Increments of glucagon (60.5 +/- 5.7 vs 70 +/- 9.2 ng/l) and <z:chebi fb="47" ids="28918,33568">adrenaline</z:chebi> (1.22 +/- 0.31 vs 1.45 +/- 0.31 nmol/l) were similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When tested using this model, patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, without microvascular complications and taking oral hypoglycaemic agents show no impairment of the <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> response and blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> recovery following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
