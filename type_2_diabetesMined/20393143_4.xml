<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The skin blood flow response to local heating (44 degrees C for 20 min) was assessed in 28 diabetic patients and 29 control subjects using a new velocity-resolved quantitative laser Doppler flowmetry technique (qLDF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The qLDF estimates erythrocyte (RBC) perfusion (velocity x concentration), in a physiologically relevant unit (grams RBC per 100 g tissue x millimeters per second) in a fixed output volume, separated into three velocity regions: v &lt;1 mm/s, v 1-10 mm/s, and v &gt;10 mm/s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The increased blood flow occurs in vessels with a velocity &gt;1 mm/s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A significantly lower response in qLDF total perfusion was found in diabetic patients than in control subjects after heat provocation because of less high-velocity blood flow (v &gt;10 mm/s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The RBC concentration in diabetic patients increased sevenfold for v between 1 and 10 mm/s, and 15-fold for v &gt;10 mm/s, whereas no significant increase was found for v &lt;1 mm/s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean velocity increased from 0.94 to 7.3 mm/s in diabetic patients and from 0.83 to 9.7 mm/s in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The perfusion increase occurs in larger shunting vessels and not as an increase in capillary flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Baseline diabetic patient data indicated a redistribution of flow to higher velocity regions, associated with longer duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A lower perfusion was associated with a higher BMI and a lower toe-to-brachial systolic blood pressure ratio </plain></SENT>
