<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated weight change and resulting glycemic and blood pressure control in type 2 diabetic patients at an HMO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using electronic medical records, this retrospective cohort study identified 2,574 patients aged 21-75 years who received a new diagnosis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> between 1997 and 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We estimated 3-year weight trajectories using growth curve analyses, grouped similar trajectories into four categories using cluster analysis, compared category characteristics, and predicted year-4 above-goal A1C and blood pressure by group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The weight-trajectory groups were defined as higher stable weight (n = 418; 16.2%), lower stable weight (n = 1,542; 59.9%), <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> (n = 300; 11.7%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> (n = 314; 12.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The latter had a mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> of 10.7 kg (-9.8%; P &lt; 0.001) by 18 months, with near-complete regain by 36 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for age, sex, baseline control, and related medication use, those with higher stable weight, lower stable weight, or <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight-gain</z:mp> patterns were more likely than those who lost weight to have above-goal A1C (odds ratio [OR] 1.66 [95% CI 1.12-2.47], 1.52 [1.08-2.14], and 1.77 [1.15-2.72], respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Those with higher stable weight or <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight-gain</z:mp> patterns were more likely than those who lost weight to have above-goal blood pressure (1.83 [1.31-2.57] and 1.47 [1.03-2.10], respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight-loss</z:hpo> pattern after new diagnosis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> predicted improved glycemic and blood pressure control despite weight regain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The initial period postdiagnosis may be a critical time to apply <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight-loss</z:hpo> treatments to improve risk factor control </plain></SENT>
