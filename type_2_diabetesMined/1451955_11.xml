<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During 1237440 person years of follow-up, 2276 women who provided information on oral contraceptive use were clinically diagnosed with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Women who used oral contraceptives in the past had only a slight and marginally increased relative risk of 1.10 (95% confidence interval 1.01, 1.21) compared to those women who had never used oral contraceptives after controlling for known risk factors of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found no evidence of increased risk with longer duration of use or with shorter interval since last use </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no effect modification by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, or physical activity </plain></SENT>
