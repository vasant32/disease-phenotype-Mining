<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To clarify this situation, we conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis encompassing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> relevant studies that were published between 1994 and 2004 and investigated this potential genetic association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 14,727 subjects from 47 studies was included in this meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cases (n=8,663) were type 1 or 2 diabetic subjects with incipient (<z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp>) or advanced diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>chronic renal failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal disease</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Control subjects (n=6,064) were predominantly normoalbuminuric </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No obvious publication bias was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using a minimal-case definition based on incipient diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, subjects with the II genotype had a 22% lower risk of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> than carriers of the D allele (pooled odds ratio [OR]=0.78, 95% CI=0.69-0.88) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While there was a reduced risk of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> associated with the II genotype among Caucasians with either type 1 or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the association was most marked among type 2 diabetic Asians (Chinese, Japanese, Koreans) (OR=0.65, 95% CI=0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>51-0.83) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This OR is significantly different from the OR of 0.90 (95% CI= 0.78-1.04) that was obtained for type 2 diabetic Caucasians (p=0.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Using a stricter case definition based on advanced diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, a comparable risk reduction of 24-32% was observed among the three subgroups, although statistical significance was reached only among Asians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The results of our meta-analysis support a genetic association of the ACE Ins/Del polymorphism with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings may have implications for the management of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> using <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitors</z:chebi> especially among type 2 diabetic Asians </plain></SENT>
