<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated whether there is a relationship between pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100601'>eclampsia</z:hpo> and the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in mothers and their babies and how this is affected by infant birthweight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This was an intergenerational cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study population comprised 7,187 mothers who gave birth and 8,648 babies who were born in Dundee, Scotland between 1952 and 1958 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Their later diabetic status was defined from 1980 to 2003 by linkage to population-based datasets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 810 (11.3%) mothers with pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100601'>eclampsia</z:hpo> and 745 (10.4%) who subsequently developed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression showed an increased risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for mothers with pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100601'>eclampsia</z:hpo>, unadjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.37 (95% CI 1.10-1.71), p=0.005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This relationship persisted after adjustment for infant birthweight, OR 1.40 (95% CI 1.12-1.75), p=0.003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the babies born between 1952 and 1958, 221 (2.6%) had developed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 137 of them male (2.9% of male subjects in study population) and 84 female (2.2% of female subjects) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The relationship between pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100601'>eclampsia</z:hpo> in the mother and the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the offspring did not reach statistical significance, OR 1.38 (95% CI 0.90-2.10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Babies with birthweight in the lowest quintile (adjusted for sex, gestation and birth order) had an increased risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, OR for lowest quintile vs highest quintile 1.84 (95% CI 1.24-2.72), p=0.002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100601'>eclampsia</z:hpo> is associated with increased risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the mother, but birthweight is a more important determinant of future risk for the offspring </plain></SENT>
