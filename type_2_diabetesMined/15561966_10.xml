<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The gene encoding insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS1) represents a strong biological candidate for a contributory role in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Indeed, functional studies have implicated the G971R variant, and a recent meta-analysis of 27 association studies suggested that carriage of 971R was associated with a 25% increase in disease risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, this association has not been evaluated in large samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study genotyped the P512A and G971R IRS1 variants in 971 U.K. type 2 diabetic subjects ascertained for strong family history and/or early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, as well as 1,257 control subjects matched by ethnicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence for association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for either variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(For example, the odds ratio [OR] for carriage of 971R was 1.11 [95% CI 0.86-1.44, P = 0.44]) An updated meta-analysis (31 studies: 5,104 case and 7,418 control subjects) remained significant for the G971R association (P = 0.025), albeit with a diminished OR (1.15 [95% CI 1.02-1.31]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additional studies of IRS1 variation will be required to obtain a robust estimate of the overall contribution of IRS1 variation to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility, but the current study suggests that previous studies have overestimated the magnitude of this effect </plain></SENT>
