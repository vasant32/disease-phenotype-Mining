<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used data from a population-based cross-sectional survey and a multiple-disease-screening programme that tested for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e>, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and risk factors related to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data on habitual areca nut chewing were available for 14,816 men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression models were used to determine whether areca nut chewing was an independent risk factor for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with non-chewers, areca nut chewers had higher age-adjusted prevalence rates for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> (11.4% vs 8.7%) and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (10.3% vs 7.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Areca nut chewing independently increased the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.19, 95% CI 0.97-1.45) and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (adjusted OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.04-1.60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The independent effects of duration of chewing were dose-dependent for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (adjusted OR 1.32 for the duration of 10-19 years and 1.41 for the duration of &gt; or =20 years), as were the effects of increased rates of areca nut chewing (adjusted OR 1.14 for &lt;10 pieces/day, 1.30 for 10-19 pieces/day and 2.02 for &gt; or =20 pieces/day); similar findings were noted for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The habit of chewing areca nut independently contributes to the risk of both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Taiwanese men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This association is dose-dependent with respect to the duration of areca nut use and the quantity of areca nut chewed per day </plain></SENT>
