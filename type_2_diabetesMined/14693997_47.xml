<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the available evidence examining the effects of the major <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive drug</z:chebi> classes on the incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Medline, and Embase were searched for English-language case-control, cohort, and randomized controlled trials involving the major <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> classes and reporting type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> as an end point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reference lists of original studies and narrative reviews were also hand searched </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One reviewer (R.P.) performed the electronic searches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both reviewers independently extracted data and assessed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> potentially relevant studies for inclusion and methodological quality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Abstracts were not included, and unpublished studies were not sought </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One case-control study, 8 cohort studies, and 14 randomized controlled trials met inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No study examined <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence as a primary end point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Poor methodological quality limits the conclusions that can be drawn from most nonrandomized trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Evidence from randomized studies is also potentially limited by several sources of bias, including treatment contamination and bias inherent in post hoc analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Data from the highest-quality studies suggest that <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence is unchanged or increased by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50264">thiazide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretics</z:chebi> and beta-blockers and unchanged or decreased by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitors</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38215">calcium channel blockers</z:chebi>, and angiotensin receptor blockers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The major <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> classes may exert differential effects on <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence, although current data are far from conclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Ongoing placebo-controlled randomized trials involving potentially beneficial drug classes and examining <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence as a primary end point should provide more definitive evidence </plain></SENT>
