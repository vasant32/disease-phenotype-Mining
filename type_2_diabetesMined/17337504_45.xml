<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a randomized, controlled, clinical trial in which participants <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> received an 18-month, group-based behavioral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> treatment and were randomized to individual sessions of motivational interviewing or attention control (total of five sessions) as an adjunct to the weight control program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Overweight women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treated by oral medications who could walk for exercise were eligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Primary outcomes were weight and A1C, assessed at 0, 6, 12, and 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 217 overweight women (38% African American) were randomized (93% retention rate) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Women in motivational interviewing lost significantly more weight at 6 months (P = 0.01) and 18 months (P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001260'>Increased weight</z:mp> losses with motivational interviewing were mediated by enhanced adherence to the behavioral weight control program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>African-American women lost less weight than white women overall and appeared to have a diminished benefit from the addition of motivational interviewing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significantly greater A1C reductions were observed in those undergoing motivational interviewing at 6 months (P = 0.02) but not at 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Motivational interviewing can be a beneficial adjunct to behavioral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> treatment for women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, although the benefits may not be sustained among African-American women </plain></SENT>
