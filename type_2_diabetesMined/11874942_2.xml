<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 18 patients after heart transplantation for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0919984" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">end-stage heart disease</z:e> (age 47 +/- 3 years; transplant age 5.5 +/- 1.5 years; BMI 25.8 +/- 0.8 kg/m(2); <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> 4.2 +/- 0.6 mg/[kg.day]; <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> 0.87 +/- 0.31 mg/[kg.day]), 12 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (D-Tx), and 6 patients without type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (Tx) were studied by means of 1) an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) to assess the beta-cell secretory response, 2) a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic (1 mU/[kg.min]) clamp combined with indirect calorimetry and a primed continuous infusion of [6,6-2H2]<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and [1-13C]leucine to measure postabsorptive and insulin-stimulated carbohydrate and protein metabolism, and 3) 1H-NMR spectroscopy of the calf muscles to measure intramyocellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> (IMCL) content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were selected from 480 transplant patients in whom there was a 6% prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five healthy subjects matched for anthropometric parameters served as control subjects (CON) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Tx had postabsorptive and insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, leucine, and free fatty acid metabolism, as well as IMCL content, similar to that of CON </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>D-Tx were characterized by a reduced secretory response during the OGTT and peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> with respect to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism, which was paralleled by increased plasma free fatty acid concentrations and IMCL content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A defective insulin-dependent suppression of the endogenous leucine flux (index of proteolysis) was also evident during the clamp in D-Tx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Heart transplantation, notwithstanding the immunosuppressive therapy, was characterized by a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> postabsorptive and insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, leucine, and free fatty acid metabolism in Tx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> with respect to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, free fatty acids, and protein metabolism was present in D-Tx regardless of whether <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was preexisting or consequent to heart transplantation </plain></SENT>
