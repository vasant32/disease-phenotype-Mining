<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Over a 12-month period, routinely collected datasets were analyzed in a population of 367,051 people, including 8,655 people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, to measure the incidence of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> that required emergency assistance from Ninewells Hospital and Medical School (NHS) personnel including those in primary care, ambulance services, hospital accident and emergency departments, and inpatient care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Associated costs with these episodes were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 244 episodes of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> were recorded in 160 patients, comprising 69 (7.1%) people with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 66 (7.3%) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treated with insulin, and 23 (0.8%) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> tablets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Incidence rates were 11.5 and 11.8 events per 100 patient-years for type 1 and type 2 patients treated with insulin, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Age, duration, and socioeconomic status were identified as risk factors for severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One in three cases were treated solely by the ambulance service with no other contact from health care professionals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The total estimated cost of emergency treatment of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> was &lt;/= pound 92,078 in one year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>Hypoglycemia</z:hpo> requiring emergency assistance from health service personnel is as common in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treated with insulin as in people with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is associated with considerable NHS resource use that has a significant economic and personal cost </plain></SENT>
