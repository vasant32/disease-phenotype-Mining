<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this 20-week double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 163 patients were randomized to receive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> up to 100 mg three times a day or matching placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both the groups were newly initiated with insulin, which was adjusted according to blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Primary efficacy parameter was the change in HbA(1c) from baseline; changes in daily insulin doses were also assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean HbA(1c) was significantly reduced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> compared with placebo (2.31 vs. 1.81%, p = 0.033) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Insulin doses were comparable at the end of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels between the treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Postprandial serum insulin levels increased in both treatment arms owing to insulin administration but less so under <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the placebo group, an increase in body mass index was prevented for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi>-treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: As adjunct administration to newly initiated insulin therapy, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> enhances the optimization of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
