<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Suboptimal glycemic control is a common situation in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, regardless of the wide range of drugs available to reach glycemic targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Basic research in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is endeavoring to identify new actives working as insulin savers, use of which could delay the introduction of injectable insulin or reduce the insulin dose needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Commonly available as a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50733">nutraceutical</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16118">berberine</z:chebi> is a potential candidate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Because its low oral bioavailability can be overcome by P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> inhibitors like herbal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26195">polyphenols</z:chebi>, we have tested the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50733">nutraceutical</z:chebi> combination of Berberis aristata extract and Silybum marianum extract (Berberol(Â®)) in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in terms of its additive effect when combined with a conventional oral regimen for patients with suboptimal glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 90 days of treatment, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50733">nutraceutical</z:chebi> association had a positive effect on glycemic and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> parameters, significantly reducing glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, basal insulin, homeostatic model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, total and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A relevant effect was also observed in terms of liver function by measuring <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> transaminase and alanine transaminase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The product had a good safety profile, with distinctive gastrointestinal side effects likely due to its <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi>-like action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although further studies should be carried out to confirm our data, Berberol could be considered a good candidate as an adjunctive treatment option in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, especially in patients with suboptimal glycemic control </plain></SENT>
