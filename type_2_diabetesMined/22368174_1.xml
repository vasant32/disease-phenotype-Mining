<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent studies reveal a strong relationship between reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> content and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in human skeletal muscle, although the underlying factors responsible for this association remain unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To address this question, we analyzed muscle biopsy samples from young, lean, insulin resistant (IR) offspring of parents with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and control subjects by microarray analyses and found significant differences in expression of ~512 probe pairs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We then screened these genes for their potential involvement in the regulation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> biogenesis using <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> interference and found that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> lipase (LPL) in skeletal muscle was significantly decreased in the IR offspring and was associated with decreased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we show that LPL knockdown in muscle cells decreased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> content by effectively decreasing fatty acid delivery and subsequent activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-δ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these data suggest that decreased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> content in muscle of IR offspring may be due in part to reductions in LPL expression in skeletal muscle resulting in decreased PPAR-δ activation </plain></SENT>
