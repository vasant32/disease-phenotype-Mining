<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have noted that even in the absence of apparent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, persons with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have an impaired ability to carry out maximal exercise, and the impairment is correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that administration of a thiazolidinedione (TZD) agent would improve exercise capacity in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty participants with uncomplicated type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were randomly assigned in a double-blind study to receive either 4 mg/day of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> or matching placebo after baseline measurements to assess endothelial function (brachial artery diameter by brachial ultrasound), maximal oxygen consumption (VO(2max)), oxygen uptake (VO(2)) kinetics, and insulin sensitivity by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Measurements were reassessed after 4 months of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Participant groups did not differ at baseline in any measure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">Rosiglitazone</z:chebi>-treated participants (n = 10) had significantly improved VO(2max) (19.8 +/- 5.3 ml  </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>min(-1) after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>, P &lt; 0.01), insulin sensitivity, and endothelial function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A change in VO(2max) correlated with improved insulin sensitivity measured by clamp (r = 0.68, P &lt; 0.05) and with improved brachial artery diameter (r = 0.70, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Placebo-treated participants (n = 10) showed no changes in VO(2max) (19.4 +/- 5.2 ml  </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This is the first known report showing that a TZD improved exercise function in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Whether this is due to the observed improvements in insulin sensitivity and/or endothelial function or to another action of the TZD class requires further exploration </plain></SENT>
