<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analysed data from an observational cohort study, the Fremantle <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study (FDS), specifically, (1) a cross-sectional sample comprising 1,237 FDS participants with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, and (2) a longitudinal subgroup of 531 individuals who had attended six consecutive annual assessments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Neuropathy</z:e> was identified using the clinical portion of the Michigan <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Neuropathy</z:e> Screening Instrument </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At entry, the cross-sectional sample had a mean +/- SD age of 63.8+/-11.3 years, 48.7% were men, median (interquartile range) <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration was 4.0 (1.0-9.0) years, and 30.9% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fibrates and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> were used by 3.5 and 6.8%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that older age, longer <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration, central <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001254'>increased height</z:mp>, higher fasting serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> and aboriginality were significant independent positive predictors of prevalent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e>, while systolic blood pressure and fibrate use (odds ratio 0.30, 95% CI 0.10-0.86; p=0.025) were negatively associated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the longitudinal subgroup, fibrate and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> use increased to 10.4 and 36.5%, respectively, over 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In time-dependent Cox proportional hazards modelling, fibrate use [hazard ratio (HR) 0.52, 95% CI 0.27-0.98] and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> use (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.46-0.93) were significant determinants of incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> (p &lt;or= 0.042) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These preliminary observational data suggest that therapy with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> or a fibrate may protect against the development of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000763'>peripheral sensory neuropathy</z:hpo>, but there is a need for additional confirmatory evidence, preferably from randomised clinical trials </plain></SENT>
