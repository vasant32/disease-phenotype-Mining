<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because men and women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are at particularly high risk for CHD, the aim of this study was to assess the association of Lp-<z:chebi fb="79" ids="53407">PLA</z:chebi>(2) with future coronary events among diabetic men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We measured Lp-<z:chebi fb="79" ids="53407">PLA</z:chebi>(2) activity among 740 men and 777 women with confirmed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> enrolled in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS) and Nurses' Health Study (NHS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Participants were free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During 10 years of follow-up among men and 14 years among women, we documented 178 and 146 cases of CHD, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We defined CHD as coronary artery bypass graft, angioplasty, nonfatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, and fatal CHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for age, smoking, medical history, and biomarkers including C-reactive protein, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>, the relative risk of total CHD comparing extreme tertiles of Lp-<z:chebi fb="79" ids="53407">PLA</z:chebi>(2) was 1.39 (95% CI 1.01-1.90; P trend = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When we restricted analyses to only nonfatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and fatal CHD, the relative risk was 1.75 (95% CI 1.05-2.92; P for trend = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>, C-reactive protein, hormone replacement therapy use, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration did not modify these relationships </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Levels of Lp-<z:chebi fb="79" ids="53407">PLA</z:chebi>(2) activity were significantly associated with incident CHD among men and women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, independent of traditional and inflammatory risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This positive association was strongest for more severe clinical end points </plain></SENT>
