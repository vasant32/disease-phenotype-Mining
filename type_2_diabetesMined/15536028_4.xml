<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study was carried out in 77 centres (42 urban and 35 rural) to reflect the size and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of the Indian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>18,363 (9008 male and 9355 female) subjects were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>10,617 (5379 males and 5238 females) were from urban areas and 7746 (3629 males and 4117 females) from rural areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were taken after a fast of 10-12 and 2 h after 75 g of oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subjects were categorized as having impaired fasting glycemia (IFG) or DM using the 1997 ADA or having <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) or DM using the 1999 WHO criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The age- and gender-standardized prevalence rate for DM using the <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> criteria was 3.6% whilst that using the WHO criteria was 4.3% (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The respective standardized prevalence of DM, using the two criteria was, 4.7 and 5.6%, respectively (P &lt; 0.001) in the urban Indian population and 2.0 and 2.7% (P &lt; 0.02) in the rural Indian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using the WHO criteria, 581 subjects were newly diagnosed whilst the <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> criteria newly diagnosed 437 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The respective numbers for the urban population were 425 and 323, and for the rural population were 146 and 114, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> criteria could diagnose 75.2, 76.0 and 73.0% of the subjects who had DM as per the WHO criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of 739 Indian subjects who had IFG, 106 (14.3%) were diagnosed as having DM by the WHO criteria whilst 505 (68.3%) had values compatible with a diagnosis of IGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Of the 536 urban subjects with IFG, 74 (13.8%) had DM and 350 (65.3%) had IGT using the WHO criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Of the 302 rural subjects with IFG, 32 (15.8%) had DM and 155 (76.3%) had IGT using the WHO criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>505 (49.9%) of 1012 Indian subjects with IGT as per the WHO criteria had IFG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>350 (47.7%) of 733 urban subjects and 155 (55.5%) of 279 rural subjects with IGT had values compatible with IFG as per the <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> criteria </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The use of the <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> criteria would underestimate the prevalence of DM by not diagnosing subjects showing a poor response to a <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>This along with the discrepancies between subjects showing IGF or IGT could be a challenge to any prevention program </plain></SENT>
