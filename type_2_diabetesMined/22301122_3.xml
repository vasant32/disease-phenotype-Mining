<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We enrolled 42 patients (26 males and 16 females aged 56.64 ± 12.67 years) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011882" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic neuropathy</z:e> defined by symmetric distally predominant sensory symptoms, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000762'>abnormal nerve conduction</z:hpo> studies, and reduced intraepidermal nerve fiber density in the leg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Skin biopsies of the distal leg were immunostained with antiprotein gene product 9.5 for nerve fibers and counterstained with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34653">Congo red</z:chebi> for sweat glands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sweat gland innervation index (SGII) was quantified with a new computerized area-based morphometric system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Protein gene product 9.5(+) nerve terminals surrounded secretory coils of the sweat glands in the skin of control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sudomotor denervation was present in diabetic patients, manifesting as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of periglandular nerve fibers with lower SGII compared with 42 age- and sex-matched control subjects (2.54 ± 1.87 vs. 4.68 ± 1.51%, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The SGII was correlated with HbA(1c) (P = 0.011) and was lower in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000970'>anhidrosis</z:hpo> of the feet compared with those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000975'>sweating</z:hpo> of the feet (0.82 ± 0.69 vs. 3.00 ± 1.81%, P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sudomotor denervation was concordant with cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0002459'>autonomic dysfunction</z:hpo> as assessed with <z:mp ids='MP_0005333'>reduced heart rate</z:mp> variability (P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Sudomotor denervation is a significant presentation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011882" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic neuropathy</z:e>, and the SGII was associated with HbA(1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A skin biopsy offers a structural assessment of sudomotor innervation </plain></SENT>
