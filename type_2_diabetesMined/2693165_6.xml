<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After glucagon injection, the relative <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> potentiation of the insulin response was significantly higher than the relative <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> potentiation of the C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> response at each level of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This difference may be explained by a higher fractional hepatic removal of insulin at normoglycaemia, since the molar ratio between the incremental C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> and insulin responses after glucagon stimulation was higher at prestimulatory normoglycaemia (4.85 (3.65-12.05] than at the prestimulatory blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations approximately 12 mmol/l (2.41 (2.05-4.09] (p less than 0.01) and approximately 20 mmol/l (2.24 (1.37-3.62] (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the islet B-cell responses to glucagon and a standard mixed meal are potentiated to a high degree by acutely established prestimulatory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> in patients with well-controlled Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
