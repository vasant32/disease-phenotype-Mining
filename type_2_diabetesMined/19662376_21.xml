<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have found positive associations between meat consumption and the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but the results have been inconsistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies of meat consumption and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We searched several databases for cohort studies on meat consumption and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk, up to December 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Summary relative risks were estimated by use of a random-effects model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 12 cohort studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The estimated summary RR and 95% confidence interval of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> comparing high vs low intake was 1.17 (95% CI 0.92-1.48) for total meat, 1.21 (95% CI 1.07-1.38) for red meat and 1.41 (95% CI 1.25-1.60) for processed meat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> amongst the studies of total, red and processed meat which, to some degree, was explained by the study characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These results suggest that meat consumption increases the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the possibility that residual confounding could explain this association cannot be excluded </plain></SENT>
