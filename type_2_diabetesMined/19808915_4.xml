<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The brain MRI study and the carotid ultrasonography were performed in a total of 217 consecutive Japanese subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Various risk factors for SCI were examined using multiple logistic analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The SCI was found in 60.4% of the diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the diabetic subjects, age, systolic blood pressure (SBP), pulse wave velocity, and CCA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> were significantly higher in the subjects with SCI than in those without it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic analyses indicated that age, SBP, and CCA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> were significant and independent risk factors of SCI in the diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CCA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>, but not pulse wave velocity, was independently associated with SCI in Japanese subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
