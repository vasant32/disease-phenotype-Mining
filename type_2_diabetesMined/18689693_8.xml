<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Accumulating evidence suggests that energy-dense foods predispose to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and that such foods may also be associated with an increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but there is limited evidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to investigate whether there is an independent association between dietary energy density and incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The European Prospective Investigation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> (EPIC)-Norfolk Cohort Study was a population-based prospective study of individuals aged 40-79 years at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We calculated energy density for overall diet (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> solids and drinks) using food frequency questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During 12 years of follow-up, we documented 725 new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among 21,919 participants without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Baseline energy density (adjusted for age, sex, and baseline BMI) was higher in those who developed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (mean 3.08 kJ/g [95% CI 3.03-3.13]) than in those who remained nondiabetic (3.01 kJ/g [3.00-3.02]) (P = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Energy density was positively associated with incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (odds ratio 1.21 per unit increase [95% CI 1.06-1.38]) adjusted for known risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a 60% higher risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (1.60 [1.19-2.16]) in the highest quintile of energy density (range 3.55-7.97 kJ/g) compared with the lowest quintile (1.04-2.43 kJ/g) in adjusted analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This is the first large population-based prospective study to report that an energy-dense diet may be associated with increased risk of development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, independent of baseline <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The potential public health impact of a low-energy-dense diet on reducing the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> deserves further study </plain></SENT>
