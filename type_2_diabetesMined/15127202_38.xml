<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to compare the expression levels of the genes encoding the major proteins and enzymes of this pathway in skeletal muscle of healthy subjects and Type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The basal and insulin-regulated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> concentration of 16 genes was quantified using real-time PCR in skeletal muscle biopsies taken before and at the end of a 3-hour hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp in healthy lean subjects and in insulin-resistant <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with manifest Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15351">Acetyl CoA</z:chebi> carboxylase-2 mRNA expression was increased 2.5-fold in the muscle of the diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi> palmitoyl transferase-1, of the two adiponectin receptors and of genes involved in fatty acid transport and activation was not altered in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020459" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hyperinsulinaemia</z:e> for 3 hours increased the expression of several genes of fatty acid oxidation, including adiponectin receptor-1 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It also reduced <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase 4 mRNA levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The effects of insulin on gene expression were markedly altered in the muscle of Type 2 diabetic patients except for adiponectin receptor-1 and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase 4 mRNAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The expression of adiponectin receptors was not altered in the muscle of Type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The observed overexpression of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15351">acetyl CoA</z:chebi> carboxylase-2 is consistent with the hypothesis that increased skeletal muscle <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15531">malonyl CoA</z:chebi> concentrations in Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may contribute to the inhibition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15904">long-chain fatty acid</z:chebi> oxidation </plain></SENT>
