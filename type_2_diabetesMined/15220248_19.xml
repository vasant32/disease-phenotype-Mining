<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We carried out oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance testing followed by blood sampling 10 times for 2 h on 68 age- and BMI-matched participants of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging (BLSA) with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (34 subjects), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) (18 subjects with both impaired fasting and 2-h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels), and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (16 subjects with both diabetic fasting and 2-h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assayed plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, glucagon, and intact and total GIP levels and quantitated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and hormone responses to the oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also compared GIP and insulin release and sensitivity indexes between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> ingestion, subjects with IGT had both <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> and hyperemia, while subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had both beta- and GIP-cell deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the former group, there was also a significant positive correlation between the augmented plasma intact and total GIP levels and both fasting and post-oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> load plasma insulin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Elevated plasma GIP levels are correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> in the impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-tolerant state, whereas type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is associated with a failure to secrete adequate amounts of both GIP and insulin, indicating a common pathway of resistance to and eventually failure of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> responsiveness in beta- and GIP-cells </plain></SENT>
