<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The -866G/A polymorphism in the UCP2 gene, which enhances its transcriptional activity, was associated with enhanced risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We addressed the question of whether the -866G/A polymorphism contributes to variation in insulin sensitivity by genotyping 181 nondiabetic offspring of type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity, assessed by the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, was reduced in -866A/A carriers compared with -866A/G or -866G/G carriers (P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To directly investigate the correlation between UCP2 expression and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, UCP2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were measured by real-time RT-PCR in subcutaneous fat obtained from 100 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects who underwent laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>UCP2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was significantly correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> as assessed by the homeostasis model assessment index (r = 0.27, P = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We examined the association of the -866A/A genotype in a case-control study including 483 type 2 diabetic subjects and 565 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The -866A/A genotype was associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in women (odds ratio 1.84, 95% CI 1.03-3.28; P = 0.037), but not in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the -866A/A genotype of the UCP2 gene may contribute to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility by affecting insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
