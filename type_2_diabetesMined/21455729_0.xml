<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were eligible if they had type 1 or 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, were over 18 years of age and had participated in a 4 day group education programme offered at a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> clinic at a university hospital in Denmark </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, severe debilitating disease and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0679466" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive deficit</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Out of 469 patients who attended the group education programme, 349 patients were randomised to either a usual care control group or an intervention group, which received up to five individual counselling sessions in 1 year based on MI, in addition to usual care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A randomised parallel design was used and open-label allocation was done by random permuted blocks, with allocation concealment by sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA(1c)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis regarding measurements of glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA(1c)) and competence of self-management (using the Problem Areas in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Scale [PAID] and Perceived Competence for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Scale [PCDS]) was based on 298 participants followed for a 24 month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Data were collected at the Department of Endocrinology at Odense University Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our hypotheses were that MI could: (1) reduce HbA(1c) levels; (2) increase self-efficacy; and (3) increase <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-care, compared with usual care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Out of the 176 included in the control group and 173 in the intervention group, 153 and 145 were analysed in the groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When using the baseline value as covariate there were no significant differences in change score between the two study groups with regard to mean level of HbA(1c) (0.131, p = 0.221), PAID scores (-1.793, p = 0.191) or PCDS scores (0.017, p = 0.903) at the 24 month follow-up, using a mixed effects regression model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The patients in the intervention group showed significantly higher levels of perceived competence in dealing with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with the control group (mean change score = -0.387, p = 0.002) following 1 year of intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: We were unable to demonstrate any benefit, over or above usual care, of MI in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who have just completed a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> education programme, and who have well-regulated <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
