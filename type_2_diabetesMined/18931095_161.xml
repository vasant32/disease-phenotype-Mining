<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this 26-week, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo- and active-controlled, parallel-group trial, 1,091 subjects were randomly assigned (2:2:2:1:2) to once-daily liraglutide (either 0.6, 1.2, or 1.8 mg/day injected subcutaneously), to placebo, or to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> (4 mg once daily) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> treatments were in combination therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (1g twice daily) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Enrolled subjects (aged 25-79 years) had type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, A1C of 7-11% (previous OAD monotherapy for &gt; or =3 months) or 7-10% (previous OAD combination therapy for &gt; or =3 months), and BMI &lt; or =40 kg/m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A1C values were significantly reduced in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> liraglutide groups versus the placebo group (P &lt; 0.0001) with mean decreases of 1.0% for 1.8 mg liraglutide, 1.2 mg liraglutide, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> and 0.7% for 0.6 mg liraglutide and an increase of 0.1% for placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Body weight decreased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> liraglutide groups (1.8-2.8 kg) compared with an increase in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> group (1.0 kg; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> with liraglutide ( approximately 3%) was comparable to that with placebo but less than that with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> (17%; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>Nausea</z:hpo> was reported by 11-19% of the liraglutide-treated subjects versus 3-4% in the placebo and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> declined over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, once-daily liraglutide induced similar glycemic control, <z:mp ids='MP_0001262'>reduced body weight</z:mp>, and lowered the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi>, when both had background therapy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
