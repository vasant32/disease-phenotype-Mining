<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: It has been suggested that the high prevalence of subnormal free <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> concentrations, along with low or inappropriately <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gonadotropins in men with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, may be the result of an increase in plasma <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> concentrations secondary to an increase in aromatase activity in the adipose tissue that leads to the suppression of the hypothalamo-hypophyseal-gonadal axis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: To investigate this hypothesis, plasma <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi>, leutinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and <z:chebi fb="25" ids="50112">sex hormone</z:chebi>-binding globulin (SHBG) concentrations were measured in fasting blood samples of 240 men with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Free <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> concentrations were either calculated (n = 198) using total <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> and SHBG measured by immunoassay or directly measured by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and equilibrium dialysis (n = 102) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The calculated free <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> concentration in men with subnormal free <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> concentrations was lower than that in men with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> free <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> concentrations (median 0.047 vs. 0.063 ng/dL, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Directly measured (LC-MS/MS) free <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> concentrations were also lower in men with subnormal free <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> concentrations (median 0.025 vs. 0.045 ng/dL, P = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Free <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> concentrations were directly related to free <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> but not to BMI or age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data show that the suppression of the hypothalamo-hypophyseal-gonadal axis in patients with subnormal free <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> concentrations and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is not associated with increased <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of subnormal free <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> concentrations in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> needs to be investigated further </plain></SENT>
