<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) was related to an elevated risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in several recent studies among middle- or older-aged populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies on SSB consumption and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> among pregnant women, however, are lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore examined the association between regular SSB consumption before pregnancy and the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> mellitus (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a prospective study among 13,475 U.S. women who reported at least one singleton pregnancy between 1992 and 2001 in the Nurses' Health Study II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> was self-reported and validated by medical record review in a subsample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards models with multivariate adjustments were applied to examine the association of SSB consumption with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During 10 years of follow-up, 860 incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> case subjects were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for age, parity, race, physical activity, smoking, alcohol intake, prepregnancy BMI, and Western dietary pattern, intake of sugar-sweetened cola was positively associated with the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e>, whereas no significant association was found for other SSBs and diet beverages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with women who consumed &lt;1 serving/month, those who consumed &gt;or=5 servings/week of sugar-sweetened cola had a 22% greater <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> risk (relative risk 1.22 [95% CI 1.01-1.47]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study suggest that prepregnancy higher consumption of sugar-sweetened cola (&gt;or=5 servings/week) is associated with an elevated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> risk, whereas no significant association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> risk was observed for other SSBs and diet beverages </plain></SENT>
