<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>Coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD) accounts for a large fraction of the morbidity, mortality, and cost of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recognizing this, nearly 10 years ago the American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association published a consensus recommendation that clinicians consider a risk factor-guided screening approach to early diagnosis of CAD in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subsequent clinical trial results have not supported those recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since the prior consensus statement, newer imaging methods, such as coronary artery calcium scoring and noninvasive angiography with computed tomography (CT) techniques, have come into use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These technologies, which allow quantitation of atherosclerotic burden and can predict risk of cardiac events, might provide an approach to more widespread <z:hpo ids='HP_0004929'>coronary atherosclerosis</z:hpo> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, over this same time interval, there has been recognition of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) equivalent, clear demonstration that medical interventions should provide primary and secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk reduction in diabetic populations, and suggestive evidence that percutaneous coronary revascularization may not provide additive survival benefit to intensive medical management in patients with stable CAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This additional evidence raises the question of whether documenting asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is warranted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>More data addressing this issue will be forthcoming from the BARI 2-D (Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp>) trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Until then, for patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who are asymptomatic for CAD, we recommend that testing for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, perhaps with cardiac CT as the initial test, be reserved for those in whom medical treatment goals cannot be met and for selected individuals in whom there is strong clinical suspicion of very-high-risk CAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Better approaches to identify such individuals based on readily obtained clinical variables are sorely needed </plain></SENT>
