<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Because readily available glycemic indicators are needed to guide clinical decision-making for intensification of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> therapy, our goals were to define the relationship between casual postprandial plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (cPPG) levels and HbA(1c) in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and to determine the predictive characteristics of a convenient <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> cutoff </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We examined the relationship between cPPG levels (1-4 h post meal) and HbA(1c) levels in 1,827 unique patients who had both determinations during a single office visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The population studied was predominantly African American and middle-aged, with average cPPG of 201 mg/dl and HbA(1c) of 8.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of HbA(1c) &gt; or = 7.0% was 67% and HbA(1c) &gt;6.5% was 77% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall, cPPG and HbA(1c) were linearly correlated (r = 0.63, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The correlation between cPPG and HbA(1c) was strongest in patients treated with diet alone (n = 348, r = 0.75, P &lt; 0.001) and weaker but still highly significant for patients treated with oral agents (n = 610, r = 0.64, P &lt; 0.001) or insulin (n = 869, r = 0.56, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A cutoff cPPG &gt;150 mg/dl predicted an HbA(1c) level &gt; or = 7.0% in the whole group, with a sensitivity of 78%, a specificity of 62%, and an 80% positive predictive value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The same cPPG cutoff of 150 mg/dl predicted an HbA(1c) level &gt;6.5%, with a sensitivity of 74%, a specificity of 66%, and an 88% positive predictive value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: When rapid-turnaround HbA(1c) determinations are not available, a single cPPG level &gt;150 mg/dl may be used during a clinic visit to identify most inadequately controlled patients and allow timely intensification of therapy </plain></SENT>
