<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adipose tissue overexpression of 11β-HSD1 in rodents to levels observed in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> can lead to a near complete <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> phenotype, and inhibition of 11β-HSD1 has been proposed to be of potential therapeutic benefit to patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently published clinical results with the selective 11β-HSD1 inhibitor, INCB13739, have, for the first time, provided evidence substantiating this hypothesis, and suggest that 11β-HSD1 activity may be important in regulating glycaemia and cardiometabolic risk </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, these positive effects are observed primarily in subjects categorized as <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (body mass index, BMI &gt; 30 kg/m²) and not in subjects categorized as overweight (BMI ≤ 30 kg/m²), underscoring the likely importance of adipose tissue 11β-HSD1 activity to the cardiometabolic sequelae of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This review summarizes the therapeutic rationale for 11β-HSD1 inhibition, and describes in detail the metabolic and endocrinologic changes observed in patients with T2DM treated with INCB13739 </plain></SENT>
