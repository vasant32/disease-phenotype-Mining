<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: In type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, lung diffusing capacity for <z:chebi fb="168" ids="17245">carbon monoxide</z:chebi> (DL(CO)) may be impaired, and insulin has been shown to be beneficial in cases in which near-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> metabolic control is achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An influence of insulin, per se, on the alveolar-capillary membrane conductance is unexplored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed at testing this possibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 19 life-long nonsmoking, asymptomatic patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cardiac function, whose GHb averaged 6.2 +/- 0.3% with diet and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic drugs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DL(CO) and its subcomponents (alveolar capillary membrane conductance [D(M)] and pulmonary capillary blood volume available for gas exchange [Vc]), vital capacity (VC), forced expiratory volume 1 s (FEV(1)), cardiac output (CO), ejection fraction (EF), pulmonary wedge pressure (WPP), and pulmonary arteriolar resistance (PAR) were determined before and within 60 min after infusion of 50 ml saline + 10 IU of regular insulin or after saline alone on 2 consecutive days (random block design) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Glycemia was kept at baseline levels during experiments by <z:chebi fb="10" ids="4167">dextrose</z:chebi> infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Percent of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> predicted DL(CO) averaged 84.2 +/- 7.9% and in 14 patients was &lt;100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Insulin infusion, not saline alone, improved (P &lt; 0.01) DL(CO) (12%) and D(M) (14%) and raised DL(CO) to 98% of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> predicted value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no variations in VC, FEV(1,) CO, EF, WPP, or PAR, suggesting that the influences of the hormone on gas transfer were not mediated by changes in spirometry, volumes, and hemodynamics of the lung </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Several cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> present with increased impedance to gas transfer across the alveolar-capillary membrane, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic drugs</z:chebi> do not prevent this inconvenience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Insulin, independently of the metabolic effects, acutely improves gas exchange, possibly through a facilitation of the alveolar-capillary interface conductance </plain></SENT>
