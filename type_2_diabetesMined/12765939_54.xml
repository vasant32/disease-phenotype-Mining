<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To understand better the defects in the proximal steps of insulin signaling during type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we used differentiated human skeletal muscle cells in primary culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When compared with cells from control subjects, myotubes established from patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> presented the same defects as those previously evidenced in vivo in muscle biopsies, including defective stimulation of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase activity, decreased association of PI 3-kinase with insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 and reduced IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation during insulin stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast to IRS-1, the signaling through IRS-2 was not altered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Investigating the causes of the reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, we found a more than twofold increase in the basal phosphorylation of IRS-1 on serine 636 in myotubes from patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Concomitantly, there was a higher basal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity in these cells, and inhibition of the MAPKs with PD98059 strongly reduced the level of serine 636 phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that IRS-1 phosphorylation on serine 636 might be involved in the reduced phosphorylation of IRS-1 on tyrosine and in the subsequent alteration of insulin-induced PI 3-kinase activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, increased MAPK activity seems to play a role in the phosphorylation of IRS-1 on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32848">serine residue</z:chebi> in human muscle cells </plain></SENT>
