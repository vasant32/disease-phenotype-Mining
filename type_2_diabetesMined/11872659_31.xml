<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine whether increased glyceroneogenesis leads to increased fat mass and to explore the role of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, we overexpressed PEPCK, a regulatory enzyme of glyceroneogenesis in adipose tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transgenic mice showed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> increase in PEPCK activity, which led to increased glyceroneogenesis, re-esterification of free fatty acids (FFAs), increased adipocyte size and fat mass, and higher body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In spite of increased fat mass, transgenic mice showed decreased circulating FFAs and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> leptin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance and whole-body insulin sensitivity were preserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Skeletal muscle basal and insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> content were not affected, suggesting that skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity is <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in transgenic <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate the key role of PEPCK in the control of FFA re-esterification in adipose tissue and, thus, the contribution of glyceroneogenesis to fat accumulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, they suggest that higher fat mass without increased circulating FFAs does not lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in these mice </plain></SENT>
