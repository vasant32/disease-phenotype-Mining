<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Baseline anthropometric measurements, behavioural factors, and blood samples were collected from 1674 Indigenous adults during 1999-2000 in 19 rural communities in north Queensland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Follow-up of 487 participants occurred during 2004-2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Weight change was compared by age, sex, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and behavioural factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The association between weight change and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence stratified by baseline BMI was studied using Cox's Proportional Hazard Model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significantly more weight was gained among younger participants (absolute interval <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>: 12.5 kg among 15-24 year olds, 5.1 kg in 25-34 year olds, 3.4 kg in 35-44 year olds, and 1.0 kg in those over 45 years), and by those whose BMI was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Women were more likely than men to have substantial <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> (43.3 vs 25.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Weight change was not associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence but baseline <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> tripled the risk of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (HR: 3.1, 95% CI: 1.6-6.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Indigenous Australian adults studied here showed very high levels of <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> over a short period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interventions aimed at maintaining healthy weight, particularly among young Indigenous people are needed </plain></SENT>
