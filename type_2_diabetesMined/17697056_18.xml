<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The progressive nature of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> makes insulin initiation a necessary therapeutic step for many patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Premixed insulin formulations containing both basal and prandial insulin (so called biphasic insulin) are often prescribed because they are superior to long- or intermediate-acting insulin in obtaining good metabolic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, they are considered as an attractive alternative to classical basal-bolus therapy as fewer daily injections are required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Premixed insulin formulations include conventional (e.g. biphasic human insulin 70/30, or 30/70 in European countries, BHI 30) and newer premixed human analogues (e.g. biphasic insulin aspart 70/30, or 30/70 in Europe, BIAsp 30; insulin lispro mix 75/25-Mix 75/25, or Mix 25/75 in Europe) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Like conventional premixed human insulin, premixed insulin analogues contain a fixed proportion of soluble, rapid-acting insulin analogue, with protaminated analogue comprising the remainder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unlike conventional premixes, analogue premixes have more physiological pharmacokinetic and therapeutically more desirable pharmacodynamic profiles than premixed human insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Consequently, postprandial glycaemic control is better with premixed insulin analogues than with premixed human insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In nontreat-to-target registration trials, the lowering of <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c) with premixed insulin analogues was not inferior to that seen with premixed human insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Minor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> was similar for premixed analogue and premixed human insulins, while major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> appears to be rare with either formulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of adverse events, other than <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e>, was also similar between various premix insulins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The premixed insulin analogues, BIAsp 30 and Mix 75/25, like the fast-acting analogues from which they are derived, also allow flexible injection timing, relative to meal timing, thus improving adherence, compliance and quality of life compared with premixed human insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall, the evidence suggests that premixed insulin analogues are cost effective and have useful advantages over premixed human insulin for the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
