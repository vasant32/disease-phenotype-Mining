<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Glucokinase is present in pancreatic beta cells where it may have a key role in the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> sensing mechanism, and it is present in hepatocytes, where it may participate in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> flux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Glucokinase defects have recently been implicated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004904'>maturity-onset diabetes of the young</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To examine the hypothesis that glucokinase plays a key role in the predisposition to common familial Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, we typed 399 members of 18 Utah pedigrees with multiple Type 2 diabetic individuals for two markers in the 5' and 3' flanking regions of the glucokinase gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Linkage analysis was performed under both dominant and recessive models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also repeated these analyses with individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> who were considered affected if their stimulated (2-h) <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> exceeded age-specific <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels for 95% of the population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Under several dominant models, linkage was significantly excluded, and under recessive models log of the odds (LOD) score was less than -1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We were also unable to demonstrate statistical support for the hypothesis that a small subgroup of pedigrees had glucokinase defects, but the most suggestive pedigree (individual pedigree LOD 1.8-1.9) ranked among the youngest and leanest in our cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We can exclude a major role for glucokinase in familial Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but our data cannot exclude a role for this locus in a minority of pedigrees.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
