<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: PAD-SEARCH was the first international study to investigate the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral arterial disease</z:hpo> (PAD) in Asian type 2 diabetic patients and to demonstrate the relationships between putative risk factors and PAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In total 6625 type 2 diabetic patients aged 50 and older were enrolled and determined ankle-brachial index (ABI) and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) in Korea, China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean patient age was 63.7+/-8.2 years and mean duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 10.3+/-8.0 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One thousand one hundred and seventy-two (17.7%) subjects were diagnosed as PAD by ABI (&lt; or =0.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PAD subjects had a significantly longer duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, higher HbA1c, and a significantly lower mean BMI than non-PAD subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In terms of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profiles, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> was the only significant variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Notably, mean ABI and baPWV in females were significantly poorer than age matched males in subjects with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ABI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, mean ABI and baPWV in males were significantly poorer than in age matched females in subjects with PAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that PAD is a common complication in Asian type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, PAD screening and treatment should be emphasized for Asian diabetic patients with high risk factors </plain></SENT>
