<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently, we demonstrated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> due to reduced <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> storage in young relatives of Type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate whether this was associated with a defective insulin receptor kinase, we studied ten of these young (27 +/- 1 years old) non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerant first degree relatives of patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and eight matched control subjects with no family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity was assessed by a hyperinsulinaemic, euglycaemic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Insulin receptors were partially purified from muscle biopsies obtained in the basal and the insulin-stimulated state during the clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Insulin binding capacity was decreased by 28% in the relatives (p &lt; 0.05) in the basal biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Tyrosine kinase activity in the receptor preparation was decreased by 50% in both basal and insulin-stimulated biopsies from the relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After stimulation with insulin "in vitro", kinase activity was reduced in the relatives in basal (p &lt; 0.005) and insulin-stimulated (p &lt; 0.01) biopsies and also when expressed per insulin binding capacity (p approximately 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Insulin stimulation of non-oxidative <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism correlated with "in vitro" insulin-stimulated tyrosine kinase activity (r = 0.61, p &lt; 0.01) and also when expressed per binding capacity (r = 0.53, p &lt; 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the marked defect in tyrosine kinase activity in partially purified insulin receptors from skeletal muscle is an early event in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and contributes to the pathophysiology of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
