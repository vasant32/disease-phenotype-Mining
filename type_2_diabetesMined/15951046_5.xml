<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Using data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (United States, 1988-1994), we compared clinical phenotypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C virus (HCV)-seropositive and seronegative adults aged 20-89 years with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> (impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (IFG) or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, n=3566 including 86 with HCV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seroprevalence was higher among younger persons (3.4% for ages 20-59 versus 0.9% for ages 60-89, p=0.002), while traditional correlates of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e>) were more prevalent among older persons (both comparisons, p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To prevent confounding by age, younger and older persons were analyzed separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In both age groups, HCV was associated with signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948807" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hepatic impairment</z:e> and B-cell clonal expansion (higher alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and serum globulin, lower total cholesterol and platelet count) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only among younger persons, however, was HCV also associated with a marker for advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001395'>hepatic fibrosis</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0003281'>elevated serum ferritin</z:hpo>) and absence of the classical diabetic phenotype (overweight, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, among younger persons, HCV was currently associated with family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, positively in persons with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and inversely in those with IFG, suggesting that family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may serve as a cofactor for progression from HCV-associated IFG to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
