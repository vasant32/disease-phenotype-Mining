<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore assessed the predictive effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and insulin secretory dysfunction separately for the progression from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (NGT) to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) and from IGT to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal (M) (hyperinsulinemic clamp), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin secretory response (AIR) (25-g intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test), and body composition (hydrodensitometry or dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) were measured in 254 Pima Indians with NGT and in 145 Pima Indians with IGT, who were then followed for 0.5-13 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After follow-ups of 4.4 +/- 3.1 and 5.5 +/- 3.4 years, 79 (31%) of the subjects with initial NGT had developed IGT, and 64 (44%) of the subjects with initial IGT had developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In proportional-hazards analyses with adjustment for age, sex, and percent body fat, low M and low AIR were independent predictors of both the progression from NGT to IGT (relative hazards [95% CI] for 10th vs. 90th percentile: M 2.4 [1.2-4.7], P &lt; 0.02; AIR 2.1 [1.1-4.1], P &lt; 0.04) and from IGT to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (M 2.5 [1.3-5.0], P &lt; 0.01; AIR 1.8 [0.99-3.3], P = 0.055) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: During each stage of the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and insulin secretory dysfunction are independent predictors of worsening <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance and are, therefore, both targets for the primary prevention of the disease </plain></SENT>
