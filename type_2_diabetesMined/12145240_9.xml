<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence of beta-cell autoantigen-reactive peripheral T-cells in type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we developed an immunoglobulin-free enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay and assessed its usefulness for diagnosing this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Cellular immune responses to beta -cell autoantigens were studied both by immunoglobulin-free proliferation assays and ELISPOT assays in 33 patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 15 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, compared with 23 healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Autoantibodies against GAD65 and IA-2 were measured by radioimmunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant proliferative responses to GAD65 were observed in 10 of 31 (32.3%) type 1 diabetic patients (P &lt; 0.05), whereas GAD65-reactive gamma-interferon (IFN-gamma)-secreting cells were detected in 22 of 33 patients (66.7%) by ELISPOT assay (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of patients negative for both GAD65 and IA-2, five of six (83.3%) showed IFN-gamma positivity in ELISPOT and two of five (40.0%) showed significant proliferation against GAD65 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Using a newly developed ELISPOT assay, GAD-reactive T-helper 1 cells in PBMC of type 1 diabetic patients could be identified at a higher frequency than by the proliferation assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the immunoglobulin-free ELISPOT assay is an excellent tool for detecting T-cell reactivity to autoantigens with greater specificity and, in combination with beta-cell autoantibody determination, will improve the diagnosis of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
