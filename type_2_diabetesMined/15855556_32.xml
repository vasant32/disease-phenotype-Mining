<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe the course and predictors of glycemic control among patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> (SUs) are added to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (MF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients (n = 2,220) treated with MF monotherapy for &gt;90 days before initiating MF plus SU combination therapy between January 1998 and March 2004 were studied in a retrospective analysis of electronic medical records from U.K. primary care practices using the General Practice Research Database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Median glycoslyated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c) (A1C) before and after SU initiation was described, and patient characteristics were evaluated as predictors of time until A1C &gt; or =8.0% or <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering therapy was intensified (by starting insulin or adding a third oral agent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At 6 months post-SU initiation, median A1C resumed deteriorating at a somewhat comparable rate to that observed on MF monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Higher pre-SU A1C, younger age, female sex, shorter <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration, higher serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, and being an ex-smoker predicted time until A1C &gt; or =8.0% or <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering therapy was intensified in various analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median A1C was 9.5% when therapy was intensified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A1C &gt; or =8.0% was estimated to occur in 85% of patients 4 years after SU initiation and in 68% 4 years after initially achieving A1C &lt;7% on MF plus SU therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this population, glycemic control is improved following the addition of SUs to MF, but deterioration resumes as early as 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The high proportion of patients remaining on MF plus SU therapy despite having A1C &gt; or =8.0% suggests that there are significant barriers to starting insulin or adding a third agent when treatment goals are not achieved with this combination </plain></SENT>
