<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this pilot study was to assess whether oral supplements of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="26948,33283">thiamine</z:chebi> could reverse <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Type 2 diabetic patients (21 male, 19 female) with <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> were recruited at the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Clinic, Sheikh Zayed Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan, and randomised to placebo and treatment arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Randomisation was by central office in sequentially numbered opaque, sealed envelopes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Participants, caregivers and those assessing the outcomes were blinded to group assignment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were given 3 x 100 mg capsules of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="26948,33283">thiamine</z:chebi> or placebo per day for 3 months with a 2 month follow-up washout period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was change in urinary albumin excretion (UAE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Other markers of renal and vascular dysfunction and plasma concentrations of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="26948,33283">thiamine</z:chebi> were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: UAE was decreased in patients receiving <z:chebi fb="4" ids="26948,33283">thiamine</z:chebi> therapy for 3 months with respect to baseline (median -17.7 mg/24 h; p &lt; 0.001, n = 20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no significant decrease in UAE in patients receiving placebo after 3 months of therapy (n = 20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>UAE was significantly lower in patients who had received <z:chebi fb="4" ids="26948,33283">thiamine</z:chebi> therapy compared with those who had received placebo (30.1 vs 35.5 mg/24 h, p &lt; 0.01) but not at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>UAE continued to decrease in the 2 month washout period in both groups, but not significantly </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In this pilot study, high-dose <z:chebi fb="4" ids="26948,33283">thiamine</z:chebi> therapy produced a regression of UAE in type 2 diabetic patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
