<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35346">11beta-hydroxysteroid</z:chebi> dehydrogenase type 1 (11beta-HSD1) converts inactive 11-dehydrocorticosterone into active <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16827">corticosterone</z:chebi>, thus amplifying <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> receptor-mediated tissue <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> action, particularly in the liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To examine the role of tissue <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> action in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we analyzed expression of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> receptor and 11beta-HSD1 and their regulation by endogenous hormones in vivo and in vitro in hepatocytes from db/db mice (a model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We observed positive relations between expression of both <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> receptor and 11beta-HSD1 in liver and insulin sensitivity and expression of PEPCK <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in db/db mice and db/+ controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Increased expression of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> receptor and 11beta-HSD1 in the liver of db/db mice was correlated with elevated circulating levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16827">corticosterone</z:chebi>, insulin, and blood glu-cose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment of db/db mice with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> RU486 reversed the increases in the expression of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> receptor and 11beta-HSD1 within the liver and attenuated the phenotype of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16827">corticosterone</z:chebi> to db/db mouse primary hepatocytes activated expression of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> receptor, 11beta-HSD1, and PEPCK, and these effects were abolished by RU486 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Incubation of primary hepatocytes with increasing concentrations of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> caused dose-dependent increases in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> receptor and 11beta-HSD1 expression, whereas insulin did not affect the expression of 11beta-HSD1 and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> receptor in primary hepatocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that activation of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> receptor and 11beta-HSD1 expression within the liver may contribute to the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in db/db mice </plain></SENT>
