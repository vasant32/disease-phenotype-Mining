<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Out of the 130 patients, 58.5% satisfied the criteria of the MetS as defined by the IDF guideline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results of logistic regression analysis with adjustment for three variables (age, gender and duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) revealed that the presence of MetS as defined by the IDF guideline was not independently related to the presence of proliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e>, or macrovascular disease in the diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The waist circumference per se was not associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011882" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic neuropathy</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, or macrovascular diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that neither the presence of MetS, as defined by the IDF guideline, nor the waist circumference was associated with the presence of either microvascular or macrovascular complications in Japanese type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
