<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (2 g/day) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> (8 mg/day) monotherapy on HGU and its relation to subcutaneous fat, visceral fat (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>), and whole-body insulin-mediated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> uptake was measured before and after 26 weeks of treatment using <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography with [(18)F]2-fluoro-2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15866">deoxyglucose</z:chebi> during euglycemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo>; fat depots were quantified by magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were significantly decreased after either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> (-0.9 +/- 0.5 mmol/l) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> treatment (-1.1 +/- 0.5 mmol/l) in comparison with placebo; only <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.02 vs. placebo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When controlling for the latter, the placebo-subtracted change in whole-body <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake averaged -1 +/- 4 micromol x min(-1) x kg(-1) in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>-treated patients (NS) and +9 +/- 3 micromol x min(-1) x kg(-1) in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>-treated patients (P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> treatment were associated with an increase in HGU; versus placebo, the change reached statistical significance when controlling for sex (placebo-subtracted values = +0.008 +/- 0.004 micromol x min(-1) x kg(-1) x pmol/l(-1), P &lt; 0.03, for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>; and +0.007 +/- 0.004, P &lt; 0.07, for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After treatment with either drug, insulin-mediated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake (VFGU) was higher than with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the whole dataset, changes in HGU were negatively related to changes in HbA(1c) (r = 0.43, P = 0.01) and positively associated with changes in VFGU (r = 0.48, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> monotherapy increase HGU in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; direct drug actions, better glycemic control, and enhanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> insulin sensitivity are likely determinants of this phenomenon </plain></SENT>
