<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: It has been suggested that the polymorphic variation of GLUT1 <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transporter may contribute to genetic susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in some populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have evaluated the GLUT1-XbaI polymorphism in an association study of a Caucasian Mediterranean population and its role in the susceptibility to displaying either microangiopathic complications or any of the risk factors associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 193 type 2 diabetic patients (104 women and 89 men, 31-82 years of age, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration 13.2 +/- 6.2 years) and 90 healthy subjects (48 women and 42 men, 20-72 years of age) were recruited for the association study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For the evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, type 2 diabetic patients were matched with those not having microangiopathic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Genotypic or allelic frequencies did not differ significantly between controls and type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Regarding the distribution of clinical or metabolic parameters according to GLUT1 genotype, patients with X1X1 genotype tended to have higher diastolic blood pressure levels compared with the remaining genotypes (P = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in genotypic or allelic distribution among patients for either the presence or absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that GLUT1 loci did not contribute significantly to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in this cohort and is not a determinant for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> microangiopathic complications associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The weak association with diastolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> must be confirmed in other populations </plain></SENT>
