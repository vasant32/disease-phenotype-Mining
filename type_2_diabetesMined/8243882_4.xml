<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Many studies of Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> assume that the condition is homogeneous and clearly defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are, however, several problems with these assumptions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, definition of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is one of exclusion of other types (insulin-dependent, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004395'>malnutrition</z:hpo>-related, gestational and other rarer types) and inevitably contains a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> group of disorders the aetiology of which is largely unclear, and separation from the insulin-dependent type can be problematic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis is also imprecise in asymptomatic subjects due to the lack of accurate diagnostic tools and lack of clear distinction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An alternative to the oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test is urgently needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Epidemiological studies of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and its complications are also fraught with difficulties due to variability of the oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test, potential problems in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> measurement, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>, population selection and problems in international comparisons due to differing age structures and life expectancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Great care is needed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studies of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> to ensure that the groups under study are properly selected, well-defined and fully described </plain></SENT>
