<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This study was based on a cohort of 33,067 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> identified in the Cleveland Clinic electronic health record (EHR) who were initially prescribed a single oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agent</z:chebi> between 1998 and 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mortality was determined in the EHR and the Social Security <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> Index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A Cox proportional hazards regression model was created using medication class and 20 other predictor variables chosen for their association with mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A prediction tool was created using the Cox model coefficients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The tool was internally validated using repeated, random subsets of the cohort, which were not used to create the prediction model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Follow-up in the cohort ranged from 1 day to 8.2 years (median 28.6 months), and 3,661 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prediction tool had a concordance index (i.e., c statistic) of 0.752 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We successfully created a tool that accurately predicts mortality risk in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incorporation of medications into mortality predictions in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> should improve treatment decisions </plain></SENT>
