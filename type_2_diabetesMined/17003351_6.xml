<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, glucagon levels are elevated in relation to the prevailing insulin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relative hyperglucagonemia is linked to increased hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> output (HGO) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Antagonizing the effects of glucagon is therefore considered an attractive target for treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the current study, effects of eliminating glucagon signaling with a glucagon monoclonal antibody (mAb) were investigated in the diabetic ob/ob mouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> effects of inhibiting glucagon action were studied by an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) and by measurement of HGO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the effects of subchronic (5 and 14 days) glucagon mAb treatment on plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, and HbA1c (A1C) levels were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Glucagon mAb treatment reduced the area under the curve for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> after an OGTT, reduced HGO, and increased the rate of hepatic <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Glucagon mAb treatment for 5 days lowered plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels, whereas 14 days of glucagon mAb treatment reduced A1C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and subchronic neutralization of endogenous glucagon improves glycemic control, thus supporting the contention that glucagon antagonism may represent a beneficial treatment of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
