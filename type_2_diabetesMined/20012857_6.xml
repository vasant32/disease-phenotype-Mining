<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we report effects on patient-reported health status and well-being in the DARE Trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We randomised 218 inactive participants with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> in parallel to 22 weeks of aerobic exercise (n = 51), resistance exercise (n = 58), combined aerobic and resistance exercise (n = 57) or no exercise (control; n = 52) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intervention allocation was managed by a central office </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Outcomes included health status as assessed by the physical and mental component scores of the Medical Outcomes Trust Short-Form 36-item version (SF-36) and well-being as measured by the Well-Being Questionnaire 12-item version (WBQ-12); these were measured at the Ottawa Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Using a p value of 0.0125 for statistical significance due to multiple comparisons, mixed model analyses indicated that resistance exercise led to clinically but not statistically significant improvements in the SF-36 physical component score compared with aerobic exercise (Delta = 2.7 points; p = 0.048) and control (i.e. no exercise; Delta = 3.3 points; p = 0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For mental component scores, there were clinically important improvements favouring no (control) compared with resistance (Delta = 7.6 points; p &lt; 0.001) and combined (Delta = 7.2 points; p &lt; 0.001) exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No effects on WBQ-12 scores were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, 59/218 (27%) of participants included in this analysis sustained an adverse event during the course of the study, including 16 participants in the combined exercise group, 19 participants in the resistance exercise group, 16 participants in the aerobic exercise group, and eight participants in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants were included in the intent-to-treat analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The trial is now closed to follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Resistance exercise was better than aerobic or no exercise for improving physical health status in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No exercise was superior to resistance or combined exercise for improving mental health status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Well-being was unchanged by intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00195884 FUNDING: This study was funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (grant MCT-44155) and the Canadian <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association (The Lillian Hollefriend Grant) </plain></SENT>
