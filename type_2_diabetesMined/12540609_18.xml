<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A reduction in beta-cell mass is an important causative factor in type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) and the long-acting <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> exendin 4 (Ex-4) expand beta-cell mass by stimulating neogenesis and proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the partial pancreatectomy (Ppx) model, exogenous Ex-4 promotes islet regeneration, leading to sustained improvement in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigate the potential role of endogenous GLP-1 in islet growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We examined beta-cell mass regeneration after 70% Ppx in mice receiving the GLP-1 antagonist Ex9-39 and in GLP-1R(-/-) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In Ex9-39-treated sham-operated mice, persistent fasting <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> was observed, but beta-cell mass was not diminished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In pancreatectomized mice, persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> was noted, but this was not further exacerbated by Ex9-39 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, beta-cell mass recovery of Ppx mice was not impaired by Ex9-39 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, GLP-1R(-/-) CD1 mice showed worse <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> after Ppx compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> CD1 Ppx mice, and this correlated with a significant defect in beta-cell mass regeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The recovery of beta-cell mass differed markedly in the BALB/c and CD1 control mice, indicating a significant role of genetic background in the regulation of beta-cell mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These studies point to a role for endogenous GLP-1 in beta-cell regeneration after Ppx in mice </plain></SENT>
