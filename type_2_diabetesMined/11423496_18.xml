<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Subjects were participants in the Framingham Offspring Study, a long-term community-based prospective observational study of risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study sample consisted of 762 men and 922 women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In women, carriers of the Thr54 allele had significantly higher 2-h postchallenge insulin levels than noncarriers (104.4 +/- 73.0 vs. 93.4 +/- 61.5 microU/ml; P = 0.0139) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This relationship remained significant after adjustment for familial relationship, age, BMI, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, APOE genotype, smoking, alcohol intake, the use of beta-blockers, menopausal status, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No such significant association was observed in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In both men and women, there were no statistical associations between the FABP2 polymorphism and BMI, fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, fasting insulin, 2-h postchallenge <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, HbA(1c), and prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the FABP2 Thr54 allele may have a minor contribution to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> syndrome in a white general population </plain></SENT>
