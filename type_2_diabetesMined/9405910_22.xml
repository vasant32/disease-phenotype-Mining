<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the absorption of glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (GLP)-1(7-36) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29337,32988">amide</z:chebi> from the buccal mucosa of type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previously, the effects of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> have been studied following intravenous and subcutaneous injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Now, a mucoadhesive, biodegradable buccal GLP-1 tablet (9 mm) containing 119 nmol has been developed as a possible alternative to injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 10 type 2 diabetic patients received a single tablet under fasting conditions and before a standard meal in this randomized placebo-controlled study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean peak GLP-1 concentration was 125.1 pmol/l and occurred 30 min after application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean placebo-adjusted area under the curve was 5,334 min pmol/l, consistent with a relative bioavailability of 6% vs. intravenous injection and 42% vs. subcutaneous injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The half-life of total <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> activity after buccal administration was 17 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The placebo-adjusted <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations decreased by 1.4 mmol/l in fasting experiments and by 4.2 mmol/l after a standard mixed meal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the fasting state at 30 min, plasma <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020459" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">insulin increased</z:e> by 185% and glucagon decreased by 20%, consistent with the increase in plasma GLP-1 concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> exerted a significant insulinotropic effect during meals (calculated as an insulinogenic index, 0-120 min; 84.1 vs. 45.7 in placebo experiments) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Potentially therapeutic plasma levels of GLP-1 were achieved after administration of a single buccal tablet in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> had a marked <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering effect during the first 2 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This new GLP-1 tablet may become a feasible alternative treatment for type 2 diabetic patients, although a more prolonged pharmacokinetic profile is required </plain></SENT>
