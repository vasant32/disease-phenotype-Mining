<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The molecules mediating this effect are just beginning to be identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Uncoupling protein (UCP)-2 may be one such negative modulator of insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Accumulating evidence shows that beta-cell UCP2 expression is upregulated by glucolipotoxic conditions and that increased activity of UCP2 decreases insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>Mitochondrial</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> has been identified as a posttranslational regulator of UCP2 activity in islets; thus, UCP2 may provide protection to beta-cells at one level while simultaneously having detrimental effects on insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the latter appears to be the dominant outcome, because UCP2 knockout mice display an increased beta-cell mass and retained insulin secretion capacity in the face of glucolipotoxicity </plain></SENT>
