<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma heterozygous mice and Pro12Ala polymorphism in PPARG exhibited increased resistance to <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Smoking increases the production of reactive oxygen species, which accelerates <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> under <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To determine whether the Pro12Ala polymorphism, alone or in combination with smoking, contributes to the development of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, a case-control study was performed in 760 Chinese patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Among patients, 532 had diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> with <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> (n = 245) or overt <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> (n = 287), and 228 did not show either of these symptoms but had had <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for &gt; or =10 years and were not undergoing anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After adjustment for confounders, the Pro/Pro genotype was significantly associated with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> (odds ratio 2.30 [95% CI 1.18-4.45], P = 0.014); smoking was also an independent risk factor for diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> (1.99 [1.08-3.68], P = 0.029) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, we identified possible synergistic effects; i.e., the high-risk group (smokers with the Pro/Pro genotype) showed 4.52 times higher risk (1.78-11.48, P = 0.002) of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> than the low-risk group (nonsmokers with the Pro/Ala genotype) in a multiple logistic regression analysis controlled for the confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that the Pro/Pro genotype and smoking were significant independent risk factors for diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The possible synergistic effects of genotype and smoking may aggravate <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and contribute to the development of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
