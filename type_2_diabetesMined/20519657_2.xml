<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 173 diabetic pregnancies were studied prior to conception (V0), at each trimester (V1-V3), and after delivery and were compared with 137 healthy women at V3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During gestation, the increase in serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> concentrations was less pronounced in type 2 diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At V3, the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels of type 1 diabetic women with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance were similar but significantly higher then those of type 2 diabetic women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Elevated <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003233'>low HDL cholesterol</z:hpo> at V3 were significant predictors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001520'>large-for-gestational-age</z:hpo> (LGA) newborns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest smaller changes in serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> concentrations during pregnancy in type 2 diabetic mothers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we found a positive association between maternal <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> and LGA infants independently of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> glycemic control </plain></SENT>
