<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Participants were 882 older men and women without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> participating in the Rush Memory and Aging Project, a longitudinal clinical-pathological study of aging and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They underwent uniform evaluations, which included clinical classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and detailed cognitive function testing from which previously established summary measures of episodic memory, semantic memory, working memory, perceptual speed, visuospatial ability, and global cognition were derived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> was identified by history and direct medication inspection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> was present in 116 (13%) participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In separate linear regression models controlling for age, sex, and education, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was associated with lower levels of semantic memory (P &lt; 0.001) and perceptual speed (P = 0.005), but not with episodic memory, working memory, or visuospatial ability or with a measure of global cognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The associations of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with cognition were reduced when controlling for several vascular variables, and the associations were substantially stronger in current smokers than in individuals who never smoked or formerly smoked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, especially in semantic memory and perceptual speed and that these effects may be modified by smoking status </plain></SENT>
