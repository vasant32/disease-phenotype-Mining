<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred twenty one type 2 diabetic patients were randomized into three groups as whole wheat, wheat bran and rye bread groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each group ate 100 g of bread with water with in 10 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> measurements were made at every 30 min in 2 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Insulin was measured at fasting and at the second hour in the patients who do not use insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The same processes were repeated on the following day, with white wheat bread for each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No significant difference was found in either glycemic or insulinemic effects between four types of breads when compared to each other (p=0.093 for glycemic effect and p=0.297 for insulinemic effect) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Three different bread types consumed as an alternative to white bread in Turkey, increase blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels of diabetic patients similar to white bread </plain></SENT>
