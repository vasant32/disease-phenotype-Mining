<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the literature, there are different studies concerning the efficacy, safety and tolerability of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> as add-on therapy to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> inadequately controlled with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> are both antihyperglycaemic drugs, both lower blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> without causing overt <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> and both require the presence of insulin to generate their therapeutic effects, but act without stimulating insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Some authors reported that the improved glycaemic control obtained with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> is associated with an increase in body weight with an estimated 2-3 kg <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> for every 1% decrease in HbA(1c) which could negate some of the benefits of the improved metabolic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Some other authors, instead, reported that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> give a better improvement in the glycaemic control compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> alone without giving <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The emerging discrepancies from these studies could be because of the study design, the patient selection, the degree of glycaemic control and/or the methods to measure body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We have undertaken a thorough literature search on Medline and Embase to evaluate the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> combination in people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on the body weight </plain></SENT>
