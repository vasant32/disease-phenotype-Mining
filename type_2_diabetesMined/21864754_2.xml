<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>According to current textbook wisdom the liver is the exclusive site of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production in humans in the postabsorptive state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although animal and in vitro studies have documented that the kidney is capable of gluconeogenesis, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production by the human kidney has been regarded as negligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This knowledge is based on net balance measurements across the kidney </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recent studies combining isotopic and balance techniques have demonstrated that the human kidney is involved in the regulation of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis by making <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> via gluconeogenesis, taking up <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> from the circulation, and by reabsorbing <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> from the glomerular filtrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The human liver and kidneys release approximately equal amounts of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> via gluconeogenesis in the postabsorptive state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the postprandial state, although overall endogenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> release decreases substantially, renal gluconeogenesis actually increases by approximately 2-fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Following meal ingestion, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization by the kidney increases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake into the kidney may be implicated in diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Normally each day, âˆ¼ 180 g of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> is filtered by the kidneys; almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of this is reabsorbed by means of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), expressed in the proximal tubules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the capacity of SGLT2 to reabsorb <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> from the renal tubules is finite and when plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations exceed a threshold, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> begins to appear in the urine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Renal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> release is stimulated by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi> and is inhibited by insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Handling of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> by the kidney is altered in type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM): renal gluconeogenesis and renal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake are increased in both the postabsorptive and postprandial states, and renal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> reabsorption is also increased Since renal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> release is almost exclusively due to gluconeogenesis, it seems that the kidney is as important gluconeogenic organ as the liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The most important renal gluconeogenic precursors appear to be lactae glutamine and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
