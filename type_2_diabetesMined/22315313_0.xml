<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Abnormally elevated intracellular regeneration of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi> by the enzyme 11β-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35350">hydroxysteroid</z:chebi> dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) in fat or liver may underlie pathophysiological aspects of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Elevated 11β-HSD1 is also found in pancreatic islets of <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>/diabetic rodents and is hypothesized to suppress insulin secretion and promote <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To define the direct impact of elevated pancreatic β-cell 11β-HSD1 on insulin secretion, we generated β-cell-specific, 11β-HSD1-overexpressing (MIP-HSD1) mice on a strain background prone to β-cell failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, MIP-HSD1(tg/+) mice exhibited a reversal of high fat-induced β-cell failure through augmentation of the number and intrinsic function of small islets in association with induction of heat shock, protein kinase A, and extracellular signal-related kinase and p21 signaling pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>11β-HSD1(-/-) mice showed mild β-cell impairment that was offset by <z:mp ids='MP_0005292'>improved glucose tolerance</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The benefit of higher β-cell 11β-HSD1 exhibited a threshold because homozygous MIP-HSD1(tg/tg) mice and diabetic Lep(db/db) mice with markedly elevated β-cell 11β-HSD1 levels had impaired basal β-cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Optimal elevation of β-cell 11β-HSD1 represents a novel biological mechanism supporting compensatory insulin hypersecretion rather than exacerbating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings have immediate significance for current therapeutic strategies for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
