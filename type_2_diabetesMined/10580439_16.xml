<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Trios have played a major role in defining genes in a number of polygenic conditions, including type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed the prevalence, clinical characteristics, and suitability for defining type 2 susceptibility genes of European type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> trios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a Caucasian population in the U.K., only 2.5% of type 2 patients had both parents alive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using a nationwide strategy, we collected 182 trios defined by strict clinical criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunological and genetic testing resulted in the exclusion of 25 trios as a result of latent autoimmune <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 13), inconsistent family relationships (n = 7), and maternally inherited <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo> (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 157 remaining probands had similar treatment requirements to familial type 2 diabetic subjects but presented at a younger age, were more <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, and more frequently had affected parents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using this resource, we have not found any evidence for linkage disequilibrium between type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the glucokinase gene markers GCK1 and GCK2 and the chromosome 20 marker D20S197 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that European type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> trios are difficult to collect but provide an important additional approach to dissecting the genetics of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
