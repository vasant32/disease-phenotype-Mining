<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Cross-sectional data were analyzed from 495 Native Hawaiians, including acculturation modes, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> status, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, fasting insulin, BMI, age, and education level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Acculturation modes were assessed using an eight-item cultural affiliation questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Native Hawaiians in a traditional mode of acculturation were more likely to have type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (27.9%) than those in integrated (15.4%), assimilated (12.5%), or marginalized (10.5%) modes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The higher prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among Native Hawaiians in a traditional mode of acculturation could not be attributed to any of the sociodemographic or biological factors included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We discuss the role of psychosocial factors as possible mediators in the relationship between acculturation modes and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
