<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> is associated with an increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, many studies have investigated the association between polymorphisms near the MC4R gene and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk across different ethnic populations, with inconsistent results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we performed a meta-analysis to clarify the association of variants near MC4R with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Published literature from PubMed and Embase was retrieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> studies that evaluated the association of at least one of the two MC4R polymorphism(s) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pooled ORs with 95% CIs were calculated using the fixed-effects model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 19 studies (comprising 34,195 cases and 89,178 controls) of the rs17782313 polymorphism (or its proxy rs12970134) were included in the meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that the rs17782313 polymorphism was significantly associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk among the overall study population (OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.07, 1.13, p = 2.83 × 10(-12) [Z test], I(2) = 9.1%, p = 0.345 [<z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The association remained significant even after adjustment for body mass index (BMI) (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.03, 1.09, p = 2.14 × 10(-5) [Z test], I(2) = 4.9%, p = 0.397 [<z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further sensitivity analysis confirmed the statistically significant association of rs17782313 polymorphism with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and no publication bias was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The present meta-analysis confirmed the significant association of the rs17782313 polymorphism near the MC4R gene with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk, which was independent of BMI </plain></SENT>
