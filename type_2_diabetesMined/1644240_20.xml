<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> is high in Mauritius, a multiethnic island nation in the southwestern Indian Ocean </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of candidate genes in the different ethnic groups represents a means of assessing the genetic component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As glucokinase is known to be a key regulator of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis in liver and pancreatic Beta-cells, the human gene was isolated and a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotide</z:chebi> repeat (CA)n marker was identified at this locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A polymerase chain reaction assay was developed, and alleles differing in size were observed in individuals, according to the number of repeats in the amplified fragment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eighty-five Creoles and 63 Indians of known <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance status were typed by amplification of genomic DNA for this <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotide</z:chebi> (CA)n repeat marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four different alleles were observed including Z, the most common allele, and Z + 2, Z + 4, and Z + 10, which differed from Z by 2, 4, and 10 nucleotides respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In Mauritian Creoles, the frequency of the Z + 2 allele was greater in Type 2 diabetic subjects than in control subjects (23.8% vs 8.9%, p = 0.008), and the frequency of the Z allele was lower in Type 2 diabetic subjects (60% vs 75.6%, p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis with univariate logistic regression models indicated that the Z + 2 allele had the highest odds ratio, 3.08 (95% confidence interval 1.14-8.35, p = 0.0416), among the other risk factors (age, sex, body mass index, and waist/hip ratio) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The multivariate odds ratio for Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 2.88 (95% confidence interval 0.98-8.50, p = 0.0551).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
