<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is evidence that coding non-synonymous variants in the gene encoding paraoxonase 2 (PON2) are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in both type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined the relationship between variation at the C311S and A148G polymorphisms (together with PON2 intronic variant rs12704795) and indices of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo> (progression to micro- and macroalbuminuria, plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> increases) in 3,374 newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic subjects from the UK Prospective <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study followed prospectively (median 14.0 years), using proportional hazards models, adjusted for sex, ethnicity and other known or putative risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: rs12704795 genotypes were associated with differing rates of development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> (relative risk [RR] for CC vs AA homozygotes 0.68 [95% CI 0.54-0.87], p=0.002) but not other measures of worsening renal function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Heterozygotes for C311S were more likely to develop <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> (RR=1.31 [95% CI 1.11-1.54], p=0.001) but less likely to double <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> levels during follow-up (RR=0.49 [95% CI 0.27-0.89], p=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no corroboration of this latter association for related outcomes and no prior evidence supports heterosis effects at this locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We conclude that the PON2 variants typed in this study have, at best, a small effect on the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
