<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A polymorphism at amino acid 1367 Cys (TTG)/Arg (CTG) reportedly reduces the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> in Japanese </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the possible involvement of this polymorphism in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When polymorphism of the WRN gene was analyzed in 272 randomly recruited type 2 diabetic subjects (age 64.5+/-11.1), we found those with Cys/Arg to be older than those with Cys/Cys (p=0.021) and that the age at diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was greater in Cys/Arg than in Cys/Cys subjects (p=0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp>-free survival rate over the age, analyzed by Kaplan-Meier method, differed significantly between these two genotype groups (p=0.0125) and the survival curve was shifted to the right in the Cys/Arg group as compared to the Cys/Cys group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No difference in allele frequency was observed between our diabetic (n=272) and non-diabetic subjects (n=171, age 66.0+/-8.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the 1367 Arg allele of the WRN gene protects against the development of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> in Japanese </plain></SENT>
