<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis in humans, a hyperinsulinemic- euglycemic ( approximately 5.0 mmol/l [90 mg/dl] x 2 h) and then a hypoglycemic ( approximately 3.0 mmol/l [55 mg/dl] x 2 h) clamp was performed in 14 healthy young adults on two occasions, once with oral administration of the ATP-sensitive <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channel <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4495">diazoxide</z:chebi> to selectively suppress baseline insulin secretion and once with the administration of a placebo </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This reduction of the decrement in intraislet insulin during induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> caused an approximately 50% reduction (P = 0.0010) of the increase in plasma glucagon in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4495">diazoxide</z:chebi> clamps (from 29 +/- 3 to 35 +/- 2 pmol/l [102 +/- 9 to 123 +/- 8 pg/ml]) compared with the placebo clamps (from 28 +/- 2 to 43 +/- 5 pmol/l [98 +/- 7 to 151 +/- 16 pg/ml]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Baseline glucagon levels, the glucagon response to intravenous arginine, and the autonomic (adrenomedullary, sympathetic neural, and parasympathetic neural) responses to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> were not altered by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4495">diazoxide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that a decrease in intraislet insulin is a signal for the glucagon secretory response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> in healthy humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The absence of that signal plausibly explains the loss of the glucagon response to falling plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations, a key feature of the pathogenesis of iatrogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>, in insulin-deficient (type 1 and advanced type 2) <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
