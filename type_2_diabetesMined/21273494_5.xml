<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Urinary liver-type fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP) is a promising indicator of tubular but not glomerular damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical usefulness of urinary L-FABP as a prognostic biomarker in impaired diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This investigation involved a cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis of the relationship between urinary L-FABP levels and progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Urinary L-FABP was measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the cross-sectional analysis, the association of urinary L-FABP, with the severity of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, was investigated in 140 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and in 412 healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the patients in the former study, 104 have been followed for 4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The progression of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> was defined as progressive <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal disease</z:hpo>, or induction of hemodialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Urinary L-FABP levels were progressively increased in subjects with normo-, micro-, or macroalbuminuria and further increased in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the longitudinal analysis, high urinary L-FABP levels were associated with the increase in <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp>, progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal disease</z:hpo>, or induction of hemodialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This was particularly demonstrated in the subgroup of patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo> (n = 59), where high urinary L-FABP levels were associated with the progression of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Urinary L-FABP accurately reflected the severity of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and its level was high in the patients with normoalbuminuria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, higher urinary L-FABP was a risk factor for progression of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
