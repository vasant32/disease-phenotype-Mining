<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>m(-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>min(-1)) was studied in 30 subjects with biopsy-proven nonalcoholic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>fatty liver</z:hpo> disease (NAFLD), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, and a BMI &lt;30 kg/m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of those 30 subjects, 9 had pure <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>fatty liver</z:hpo> and 21 had evidence of steatohepatitis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, 10 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> under good metabolic control and 10 healthy subjects were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most NAFLD patients had central fat accumulation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002155'>increased triglycerides</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003233'>low HDL cholesterol</z:hpo>, irrespective of BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> disposal during the clamp was reduced by nearly 50% in NAFLD patients, as well as in patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> body weight, to an extent similar to that of the type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Basal free fatty acids were increased, whereas insulin-mediated suppression of lipolysis was less effective (-69% in NAFLD vs. -84% in control subjects; P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Postabsorptive hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production (HGP), measured by [6,6-(2)H(2)]<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In response to insulin infusion, HGP decreased by only 63% of basal in NAFLD vs. 84% in control subjects (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Compared with type 2 diabetic patients, NAFLD patients were characterized by lower basal HGP, but with similarly reduced insulin-mediated suppression of HGP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was laboratory evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> in many NAFLD patients, but clinical, histological, and biochemical data (including insulin sensitivity) were not correlated with iron status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Four subjects were heterozygous for mutation His63Asp of the HFE gene of familiar <z:mp ids='MP_0005638'>hemochromatosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We concluded that NAFLD, in the presence of normoglycemia and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or moderately <z:hpo ids='HP_0004324'>increased body weight</z:hpo>, is characterized by clinical and laboratory data similar to those found in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>NAFLD may be considered an additional feature of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e>, with specific hepatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
