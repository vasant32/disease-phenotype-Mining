<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0008255'>Transient neonatal diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (TNDM) is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0678236" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rare disorder</z:e> associated with overexpression of genes at a paternally expressed imprinted locus on chromosome 6q24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There are two overlapping genes in this region: the transcription factor zinc finger protein associated with cell cycle control and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> (ZAC also known as PLAGL1) and HYMA1, which encodes an untranslated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> linkage studies have reported linkage to chromosome 6q22-25 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that common genetic variation at this TNDM region influences type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition to the coding regions, we used comparative genomic analysis to identify conserved noncoding regions, which were resequenced for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) discovery in 47 individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six SNPs were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifteen tag SNPs (tSNPs) were successfully genotyped in a large case-control (n = 3,594) and family-based (n = 1,654) study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We did not find any evidence of association or overtransmission of any tSNP to affected offspring or of a parent-of-origin effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Using a study sufficiently powered to detect odds ratios of &lt;1.2, we conclude that common variation in the TNDM region does not play an important role in the genetic susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
