<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship between marital relationship domains (i.e., intimacy and adjustment) and glycemic control and psychosocial adaptation to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 78 insulin-treated adults with both type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were assessed on a single occasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They completed two marital quality measures (Spanier Dyadic Adjustment Scale and Personal Assessment of Intimacy in Relationships Scale) and four quality-of-life measures (<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Quality of Life Scale, Medical Outcomes Study Health Survey, Problem Areas in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Scale, and Positive and Negative Affect Scale) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Glycemic control was assessed by HbA(1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Demographic data (age, sex, type and duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, years married, other medical conditions, family history, disability, and years of education) were gathered from the chart and questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Concerning psychosocial adaptation, both of the marital quality measures were predictors of aspects of adaptation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Better marital satisfaction was related to higher levels of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related satisfaction and less impact, as well as less <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related distress and better general quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Higher levels of marital intimacy were related to better <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-specific and general quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Concerning glycemic control, there was a nonsignificant trend for marital adjustment scores to relate to HbA(1c) (P = 0.0568) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: For insulin-treated adults with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, quality of marriage is associated with adaptation to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and other aspects of health-related quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The suggestive finding that marital adjustment may relate to glycemic control warrants further study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Future work should also explore the impact of couples-focused interventions on adaptation, adherence, and glycemic control </plain></SENT>
