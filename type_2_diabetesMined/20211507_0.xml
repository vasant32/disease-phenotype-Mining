<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 575 overweight adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> completed a survey that assessed perceptions about weight management and discussions with HCP's about weight issues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among patients with BMI&gt;30, weight misperception was rare (&lt;10%) and perceived importance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> common (&gt;85%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among overweight patients with BMI&lt;30, weight misperception was more common (47%) and importance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> was endorsed less frequently (68%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most patients reported that HCP's had advised <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> (72%) and discussed weight issues at most visits (59%) </plain></SENT>
