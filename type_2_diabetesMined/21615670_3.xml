<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An 8-week, double-blind, randomized, crossover, single-centre study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eighty-six subjects (58% female, body mass index 35 ± 5 kg/m², <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c 8.3 ± 1.0%) received either exenatide 10 µg (subcutaneous) twice daily or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> 100 mg (oral) daily for 4 weeks and crossed to the other therapy for an additional 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Main outcome was time-averaged <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> during the 24-h inpatient visits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both treatments decreased average 24-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, but exenatide had a greater effect [between-group difference: -0.67 mmol/l, 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.9 to -0.4 mmol/l] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both treatments decreased 2-h postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi>), area under the curve of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> above 7.8 mmol/l (140 mg/dl) and 11 mmol/l (200 mg/dl) and increased the time spent with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> between 3.9 and 7.8 mmol/l (70 and 140 mg/dl) during 24 h, but exenatide had a significantly greater effect (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both treatments decreased postprandial serum glucagon, with exenatide having a greater effect (p &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both treatments decreased fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> to a similar degree (p = 0.766) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">Sitagliptin</z:chebi> increased, while exenatide decreased, postprandial intact glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both drugs improved homeostasis model assessment of β-cell function (HOMA-B), with exenatide having a significantly greater effect (p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both exenatide and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> decreased 24-h caloric intake, with exenatide having a greater effect (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no episode of major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Adverse events were mild to moderate and mostly gastrointestinal in nature with exenatide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No study withdrawals were due to an adverse event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Compared to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi>, exenatide showed significantly lower average 24-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, 2-h <z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi>, glucagon, caloric intake and improved HOMA-B </plain></SENT>
