<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to evaluate how risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birth weight</z:hpo> is affected by accumulation of body mass from childhood to adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Subjects from the 1958 British birth cohort (born 3-9 March 1958) have been followed regularly since birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the survey at 41 years of age, 88 participants reported type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 10683) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Participants in whom <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> developed weighed less at birth and had higher BMIs than the others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Birth weight (adjusted for gestational age and sex) was inversely related to risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (odds ratio for 1-SD change 0.76, 95% CI 0.56-0.99) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> diabetic participants in the lowest third of birth weight were in the highest third of <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> by 23 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was found for those in the lowest third of BMI at 7 years of age (2.84, 1.2-6.9), but diabetic participants in this group had excessive <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> to 23 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but one diabetic participant in the highest third of childhood BMI remained in the highest third until 23 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by BMI at 23 years of age was 22.9-fold (95% CI 12-42) for <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> participants and 3.8-fold (2.1-6.9) for overweight participants compared with those of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There was no increase in risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for small size at birth without excessive postnatal <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> was the most important risk factor for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> developing by early midlife </plain></SENT>
