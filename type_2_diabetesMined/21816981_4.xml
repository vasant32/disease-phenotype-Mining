<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is increasing alarmingly in both developed and developing countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) has been associated with the prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this cross-sectional study is to examine the association between type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and POP exposure in the Helsinki Birth Cohort Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The cohort consists of 8,760 people born in Helsinki during 1934-1944, before the global POP emission peak </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 2003, a clinical examination was performed, including blood sampling for laboratory analyses of serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and POPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Complete data from the examination were available for 1,988 participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of each POP were categorized into four groups on the basis of percentile intervals, and logistic regression was performed to examine <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevalence across the POP categories, adjusting for sex, age, waist circumference, and mean arterial pressure and using the lowest category as the reference group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the participants with the highest exposure to oxychlordane, trans-nonachlor, 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis-(p-chlorophenyl)-<z:chebi fb="46" ids="29362">ethylene</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16598">p,p'-DDE</z:chebi>, and polychlorinated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17097">biphenyl</z:chebi> 153, the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 1.64-2.24 times higher than that among individuals with the lowest exposure (P(lin) = 0.003-0.050, where P(lin) is the P value for linear trend across POP categories) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the stratified analysis, the associations between type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and oxychlordane and trans-nonachlor remained significant and were strongest among the overweight participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Exposure to 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl <z:chebi fb="91" ids="25698">ether</z:chebi> (BDE 47) and 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexabromodiphenyl <z:chebi fb="91" ids="25698">ether</z:chebi> (BDE 153) was not associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the association between type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and adult-only exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38656">organochlorine pesticides</z:chebi> in a general urban population </plain></SENT>
