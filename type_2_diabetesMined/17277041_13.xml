<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Birth weight has been associated with the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in several studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether prenatal influences on birth weight (gestational age, parity, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">preeclampsia</z:e>, prepregnancy BMI, smoking during pregnancy, and socioeconomic position [SEP]) were associated with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in midlife and the role of birth weight for gestational age (BGA) and adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> in mediating these associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data from 7,518 participants of the 1958 British Birth Cohort with information on A1C at age 45 years were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Associations between prenatal exposures and A1C &gt; or =6% were examined using a series of logistic regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The basic model consisted of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> prenatal factors (except parity) adjusted for sex and family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further adjustments included BGA only, concurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> only (BMI and waist circumference), and BGA plus <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the basic model, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">preeclampsia</z:e> (odds ratio 1.78 [95% CI 1.14-2.80]), prepregnancy BMI &gt; or =25 kg/m(2) (1.90 [1.45-2.47]), maternal smoking (1.33 [1.04-1.71]), and manual SEP (1.87 [1.36-2.58]) were independently associated with A1C at 45 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adjustment for BGA had little impact on the prenatal factors/A1C associations, whereas adjustment for adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> at 45 years substantially reduced associations for prepregnancy BMI, smoking during pregnancy, and SEP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal exposures were related to blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels in mid-adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Associations for several prenatal factors were largely mediated through adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> but surprisingly not through birth weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Prenatal exposures are likely to have the strongest effect on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism indirectly through their influence on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> </plain></SENT>
