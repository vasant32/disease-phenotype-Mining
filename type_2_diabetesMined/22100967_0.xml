<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective study among 66,118 disease-free French women with dietary information from a validated questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Between 1993 and 2007, we identified 1,369 cases of incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analyses were adjusted for age, education, region, smoking, BMI, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo>, physical activity, parental history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, menopause, hormone replacement therapy, alcohol, calories, n-3 fatty acids, carbohydrates, coffee, fiber, and fruits and vegetables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Comparing the highest category of processed meat intake, â‰¥5 servings/week (median, 48 g/day), to the lowest, &lt;1 serving/week (median, 5 g/day), processed meat was significantly associated with incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (hazard ratio 1.30 [95% CI 1.07-1.59], P trend = 0.0007; for 1 serving/day, 1.29 [1.14-1.45]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unprocessed red meat was not associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this large prospective cohort of French women, a direct association was observed only for processed red meat and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
