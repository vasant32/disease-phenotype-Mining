<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control has been recently recognized as an important target for reducing overall glycemic burden in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Some authors assert that reductions in postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels may lead to a decrease in cardiovascular risk, one of the major complications associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were analysed from a 26-week PIO monotherapy study of 88 patients who underwent a 3-h oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (75 g dose) at baseline and last measurement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Change from baseline in area under the curve (AUC) values and hourly <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations were calculated and analysed at both time points for four medication groups: placebo group and PIO 15, 30 and 45 mg groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Changes from baseline in fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) and A1C also were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> AUC was significantly (p &lt; 0.05) different from baseline at 15, 30 and 45 mg doses of PIO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, when compared to placebo, PIO (15, 30 and 45 mg) significantly decreased post-challenge blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> AUC (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean hourly blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels at last measurement for PIO 15, 30 and 45 mg <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were significantly lower (p &lt; 0.05) than placebo at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, PIO significantly (p &lt; 0.05) reduced FPG and A1C from baseline to last measurement in a dose-related fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PIO significantly reduced post-challenge <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels following an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> challenge, leading to improvements in overall glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> lowering is one of several metabolic effects of PIO in addition to decreasing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and improving some <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Whether these combined metabolic effects can lead to cardiovascular risk reductions may be confirmed by the pending results of cardiovascular outcomes studies with PIO </plain></SENT>
