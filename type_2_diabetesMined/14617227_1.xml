<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: The current study tested the hypothesis that the neointimal response to endovascular injury is enhanced in female <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> (OZ) rats, a model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Animals were randomized to receive either a standard diet (SD) or a diabetogenic diet (DD) for 6 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four weeks later, balloon injury of the right common carotid artery was induced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> rats were euthanized 2 weeks after injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lean <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> (LZ) rats served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At the time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was elevated in OZ rats fed a SD (208 +/- 13 mg/dl) and a DD (288 +/- 21 mg/dl) compared to corresponding LZ rats (SD: 153 +/- 8; DD: 132 +/- 7 mg/dl) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ratio of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (HDLc) to total cholesterol (Totc), an index of atherogenicity, was reduced in OZ rats on both diets (SD: 0.77 +/- 0.06; DD: 0.80 +/- 0.09) compared to LZ controls (SD: 1.11 +/- 0.02; DD: 1.20 +/- 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Histomorphometric analysis of injured arteries showed that the intima to media (I : M) ratio was significantly increased in OZ (1.37 +/- 0.07) compared to LZ (0.79 +/- 0.08) rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Elevations in plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (Tg) correlated positively and decreases in HDLc negatively with an increased I : M ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Administration of the DD did not further enhance the I : M ratio in LZ (0.87 +/- 0.06) or OZ (1.29 +/- 0.09) rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that neointima formation following endoluminal injury of the carotid artery is enhanced at an early stage in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
