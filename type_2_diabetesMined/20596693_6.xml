<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This population-based study included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> residents (n = 251,386) in the catchment area of the eye clinic of Linköping University Hospital, Sweden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 12,026), those with and without DR were identified through register data from both the Care Data Warehouse in Ostergötland, an administrative healthcare register, and the Swedish National <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Register </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Healthcare cost data were elicited by record linkage of these two registers to data for the year 2008 in the Cost Per Patient Database developed by Ostergötland County Council </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of any DR was 41.8% (95% CI 38.9-44.6) for patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 27.9% (27.1-28.7) for patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sight-threatening DR was present in 12.1% (10.2-14.0) and 5.0% (4.6-5.4) of the type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> populations respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The annual average healthcare cost of any DR was euro72 (euro53-91) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Stratified into background <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, proliferative DR, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0730362" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">maculopathy</z:e>, and the last two conditions combined, the costs were euro26 (euro10-42), euro257 (euro155-359), euro216 (euro113-318) and euro433 (euro232-635) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The annual cost for DR was euro106,000 per 100,000 inhabitants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study presents new information on the prevalence and costs of DR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Approximately one-third of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have some form of DR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Average healthcare costs increase considerably with the severity of DR, which suggests that preventing progression of DR may lower healthcare costs </plain></SENT>
