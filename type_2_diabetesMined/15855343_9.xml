<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigates the association between polymorphonuclear leukocytes and development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure and plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were determined in 15 diabetic and 6 nondiabetic monkeys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The plasma levels of total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> were determined just before the start of the animal's final decline and elective necropsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Retinas were incubated for ADPase (labels viable <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> blood vessels) and nonspecific esterase (labels neutrophils) activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Polymorphonuclear leukocytes were counted per millimeter squared of retina </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After the retina was flat-embedded in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34288">glycol methacrylate</z:chebi>, tissue sections were taken through areas of interest and observed microscopically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Elevated numbers of intravascular polymorphonuclear leukocytes were present adjacent to areas with <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> capillary nonperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were significantly more polymorphonuclear leukocytes per millimeter squared in diabetic retinas (6.91 +/- 5.01) compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> retinas (1.45 +/- 1.62, P = 0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was also significantly associated with greater numbers of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was a significant positive exponential correlation between the number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes per millimeter squared and the level of total cholesterol (R = 0.907), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (R = 0.875), the total cholesterol-to-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> ratio (R = 0.86), and total <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (R = 0.888) </plain></SENT>
