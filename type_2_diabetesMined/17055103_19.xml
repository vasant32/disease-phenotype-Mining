<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A meta-analysis was performed to assess the overall risk for developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> secondary to TZD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A systematic literature search was conducted using five electronic databases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> prospective, randomized, either placebo-controlled or comparative studies reporting the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> with TZD therapy were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios were generated by pooling estimates across the studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The analysis included 26 studies consisting of 15,332 patients with T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pooled odds ratio for TZD induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> was 2.26 (95% CI: 2.02-2.53) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results yielded a higher risk for developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> (3.75 [2.70-5.20]) compared to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (2.42 [1.90-3.08]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Concordant results persisted with calculations of the adjusted indirect estimate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This meta-analysis demonstrates at least a two-fold increase in the risk for developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> with a TZD agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The risk appears to be greater with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> than with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to explore this difference </plain></SENT>
