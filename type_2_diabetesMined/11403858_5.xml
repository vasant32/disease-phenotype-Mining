<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known about the association between prospective changes of <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> and the risk factors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, or gene polymorphism in non-diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a 6-year prospective study of risk factors for progression of <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> in non-diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The participants were 116 non-diabetic subjects who consecutively underwent medical examinations for Japanese-Americans living in Hawaii </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the baseline examination in 1992, normoalbuminuria was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 6 years, 101 subjects remained normoalbuminuria (non-progressors), 15 subjects changing from normoalbuminuria to <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> and were defined as progressors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In progressors, compared with non-progressors, the fasting insulin level and HOMA-R were significantly higher at 3 years follow-up, and the systolic and diastolic pressure and Sigma insulin level were significantly higher at 6 years follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo> appeared earlier than the appearance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In progressors, there was no significant correlation with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) genotype or angiotensinogen (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AGT</z:e>) genotype compared with non-progressors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the appearance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> should be regarded as a remarkable mediator of <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
