<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp, combined with skeletal muscle biopsies and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake measurements over rested and exercised muscle, was performed before and after 26 weeks of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (n = 9), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> (n = 10), or placebo (n = 11) treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Insulin-mediated whole-body and leg muscle <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake was enhanced 36 and 32%, respectively, after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.01) but not after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> or placebo treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020459" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Insulin increased</z:e> insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) tyrosine phosphorylation, IRS-1-associated phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase activity, and phosphorylation of Akt Ser473 and AS160, a newly described Akt substrate that plays a role in GLUT4 exocytosis, approximately 2.3 fold before treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These insulin signaling parameters were unaltered after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>, or placebo treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression of selected genes involved in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and fatty acid metabolism in skeletal muscle was unchanged between the treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Low-intensity <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> exercise increased insulin-mediated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake but was without effect on insulin signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the insulin-sensitizing effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> are independent of enhanced signaling of IRS-1/PI 3-kinase/Akt/AS160 in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
