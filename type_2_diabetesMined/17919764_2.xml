<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> demonstrate cardiac diastolic dysfunction, it is well known that cardiac diastolic dysfunction is produced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and aging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to elucidate the cardiac structure and function in normotensive patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in various age strata in order to assess the effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> itself on cardiac function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Echocardiographic examination was performed in 77 normotensive patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (age: 63+/-11 years) and 76 healthy control subjects (age: 60+/-11 years) who were in their forties, fifties, sixties, and seventies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The left ventricular (LV) wall thickness and dimension were measured by M-mode echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relative wall thickness, LV mass index, and LV ejection fraction (LVEF) were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LV diastolic function was assessed by the peak velocity of early rapid filling (E velocity) and the peak velocity of atrial filling (A velocity), and the ratio of E to A (E/A) using the transmitral flow velocity, which were obtained by Doppler echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No difference was observed in the relative wall thickness, LV mass index, or LVEF between the diabetic patients and control subjects in any of the age strata </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The E/A ratio in the patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was not different from that in the control subjects in their 40s (1.17+/-0.35 versus 1.20+/-0.36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, E/A was significantly lower in the diabetic patients than in the control subjects in their 50s (0.87+/-0.28 versus 1.14+/-0.24), 60s (0.78+/-0.22 versus 0.97+/-0.27), and 70s (0.66+/-0.19 versus 0.84+/-0.21) (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The duration of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was significantly longer in patients in their 50s (7.0+/-2.5 years), 60s (8.0+/-3.2 years), and 70s (10.4+/-3.2 years) than in patients in their 40s (3.3+/-1.9 years) (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The value of E/A in the diabetic patients correlated with the duration of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (r=-0.62, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that cardiac diastolic dysfunction without LV systolic dysfunction in patients with well-controlled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is related neither to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> nor LV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>, but rather to aging and the duration of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
