<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patient clinical characteristics and autoantibody status were determined at entry to the UK Prospective <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study (UKPDS) before randomisation to different <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control policies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed for 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Data available on 4,545 of the 5,102 UKPDS patients showed that 11.6% had antibodies to at least one of three antigens: islet cell cytoplasm, glutamic acid decarboxylase and islet autoantibody 2A (IA-2A) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Autoantibody-positive patients were younger, more often Caucasian and leaner, with lower beta cell function and higher insulin sensitivity than autoantibody-negative patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They also had higher HbA1c, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> levels, and lower blood pressure, total cholesterol and plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite relative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e>, autoantibody-positive patients were less likely to have the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> (as defined by the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Program III), reflecting a more beneficial overall risk factor profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of 3,867 patients with post-dietary run-in fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) values between 6.0 and 14.9 mmol/l and no hyperglycaemic symptoms, 9.4% were autoantibody-positive, compared with 25.1% of 678 patients with FPG values of 15.0 mmol/l or higher, or hyperglycaemic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In both groups, no differences were seen between those with and without autoantibodies in changes to HbA1c over time, but autoantibody-positive patients required insulin treatment earlier, irrespective of the allocated therapy (p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Autoantibody-positive patients can be treated initially with sulphonylurea, but are likely to require insulin earlier than autoantibody-negative patients </plain></SENT>
