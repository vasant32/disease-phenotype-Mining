<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Grip strength was assessed with a Jamar dynamometer and pinch power was measured with a pinch gauge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Body composition was measured using a Tanita body composition analyzer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mann-Whitney test, chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, T-test, Kruskal-Wallis variance analysis, Wilcoxon's signed rank test and Pearson's correlation coefficients were used to determine the differences and relations between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A p-value &lt;0.05 was taken as statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Hand grip strength test values were significantly lower in the diabetic group compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Key pinch power value for the right hand was significantly lower in the diabetic group than in the control group whereas the left hand value was similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Hand grip strength and key pinch power values were found to be lower in patients with T2DM than in age-matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hands, as well as feet, are also affected by <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and physicians should be aware of this </plain></SENT>
