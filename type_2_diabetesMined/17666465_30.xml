<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Experimental data indicate that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_591'>fatty infiltration</z:mpath> of pancreatic islets may also contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta-cell dysfunction</z:hpo>, but whether this occurs in humans in vivo is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy and oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests, we studied the association of pancreatic <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> accumulation in vivo and various aspects of beta-cell function in 12 insulin-naive type 2 diabetic and 24 age- and BMI-matched nondiabetic men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients versus control subjects had higher A1C, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and insulin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels and lower <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, but similar waist circumference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median (interquartile range) pancreatic fat content in patients and control subjects was 20.4% (13.4-43.6) and 9.7% (7.0-20.2), respectively (P = 0.032) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pancreatic fat correlated negatively with beta-cell function parameters, including the insulinogenic index adjusted for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, early <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion, beta-cell <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> sensitivity, and rate sensitivity (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05), but not potentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, these associations were significantly affected by the diabetic state, such that a significant association of pancreatic fat with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta-cell dysfunction</z:hpo> was only present in the nondiabetic group (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.01), suggesting that once <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> occurs, factors additional to pancreatic fat account for further beta-cell function decline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In control subjects, the association of pancreatic fat and beta-cell function remained significant after correction for BMI, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (P = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that pancreatic <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> content may contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta-cell dysfunction</z:hpo> and possibly to the subsequent development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in susceptible humans </plain></SENT>
