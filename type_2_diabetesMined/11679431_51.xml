<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Postprandial release of the incretin glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) has been suggested to act as an endogenous satiety factor in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In rats, however, the evidence for this is equivocal probably because of very high endogenous activity of the GLP-1 degrading enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we show that intravenously administered GLP-1 (100 and 500 microg/kg) decreases food intake for 60 min in hungry rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This effect is pharmacologically specific as it is inhibited by previous administration of 100 microg/kg exendin(9-39), and biologically inactive GLP-1(1-37) had no effect on food intake when administered alone (500 microg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> intravenous administration of GLP-1 also caused dose-dependent inhibition of water intake, and this effect was equally well abolished by previous administration of exendin(9-39) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A profound increase in <z:mp ids='MP_0001762'>diuresis</z:mp> was observed after intravenous administration of both 100 and 500 microg/kg GLP-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using a novel long-acting injectable GLP-1 derivative, NN2211, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and subchronic anorectic potentials of GLP-1 and derivatives were studied in both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rats and rats made <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> by neonatal monosodium <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> treatment (MSG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We showed previously that MSG-treated animals are insensitive to the anorectic effects of centrally administered GLP-1(7-37) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and MSG-lesioned rats were randomly assigned to groups to receive NN2211 or vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A single bolus injection of NN2211 caused profound dose-dependent inhibition of overnight food and water intake and increased <z:mp ids='MP_0001762'>diuresis</z:mp> in both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and MSG-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Subchronic multiple dosing of NN2211 (200 microg/kg) twice daily for 10 days to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and MSG-treated rats caused profound inhibition of food intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The marked decrease in food intake was accompanied by <z:mp ids='MP_0001262'>reduced body weight</z:mp> in both groups, which at its lowest stabilized at approximately 85% of initial body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Initial excursions in water intake and <z:mp ids='MP_0001762'>diuresis</z:mp> were transient as they were normalized within a few days of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Lowered plasma levels of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> and leptin were observed during NN2211 treatment in both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and MSG-treated <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In a subsequent study, a 7-day NN2211 treatment period of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rats ended with measurement of energy expenditure (EE) and body composition determined by indirect calorimetry and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Compared with vehicle-treated rats, NN2211 and pair-fed rats decreased their total EE corresponding to the observed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, such that EE per weight unit of lean body mass was unaffected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Despite its initial impact on body fluid balance, NN2211 had no debilitating effects on body water homeostasis as confirmed by analysis of body composition, plasma electrolytes, and hematocrit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>This is in contrast to pair-fed animals, which displayed hemoconcentration and tendency toward increased percentage of fat mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The present series of experiments show that GLP-1 is fully capable of inhibiting food intake in rats via a peripherally accessible site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The loss in body weight is accompanied by decreased levels of circulating leptin indicative of loss of body fat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The profound <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> caused by NN2211 treatment was without detrimental effects on body water homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Thus, long-acting GLP-1 derivatives may prove efficient as weight-reducing therapeutic agents for overweight patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
