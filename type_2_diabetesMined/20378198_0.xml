<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the influencing factors of QTc in type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study involved 207 patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and 141 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>QTc was estimated from resting lead II electrocardiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data analysis was done using unpaired Student's 't' and Pearson correlation tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Only female diabetics with somatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> had longer QTc compared to controls (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only in male diabetics negative correlation was found between QTc and heart rate response to deep breathing (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Male and female study subjects with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> had longer QTc compared to controls (p&lt;0.01, 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only male diabetics with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> had longer QTc compared to controls (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: QTc prolongation is associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011882" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic neuropathy</z:e> with sex difference in its manifestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is influenced by diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> in male and female diabetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is influenced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in male type 2 diabetics </plain></SENT>
