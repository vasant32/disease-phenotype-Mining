<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate whether diabetic patients carrying the Arg(972) insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) variant are at increased risk for secondary failure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 477 unrelated Caucasian type 2 diabetic patients were recruited according to the following criteria: <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after age 35 years, absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002919'>ketonuria</z:hpo> at diagnosis, and anti-GAD(-) antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was diagnosed according to the American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with secondary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> failure were defined as those requiring insulin due to uncontrolled <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> (fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &gt;300 mg/dl) despite <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> combined therapy, appropriate diet, and absence of any conditions causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the total patients, 53 (11.1%) were heterozygous for the Arg(972) IRS-1 variant, 1 (0.2%) was homozygous, and the remainder (88.7%) were homozygous for the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The genotype frequency of the Arg(972) IRS-1 variant was 8.7% among diabetic patients well controlled with oral therapy and 16.7% among patients with secondary failure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> (odds ratio 2.1 [95% CI 1.18-3.70], P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adjustment for age, sex, BMI, metabolic control, age at diagnosis, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and Pro12Ala polymorphism of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma2 gene in a logistic regression analysis with secondary failure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> as a dependent variable did not change this association (2.0 [1.38-3.86], P = 0.038) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that the Arg(972) IRS-1 variant is associated with increased risk for secondary failure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi>, thus representing a potential example of pharmacogenetics in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
