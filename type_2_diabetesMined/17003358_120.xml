<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We genotyped 13 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across TCF7L2 in 8,310 individuals in family-based and case-control designs from Scandinavia, Poland, and the U.S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We convincingly confirmed the previous association of TCF7L2 SNPs with the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (rs7903146T odds ratio 1.40 [95% CI 1.30-1.50], P = 6.74 x 10(-20)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In nondiabetic individuals, the risk genotypes were associated with a substantial reduction in the insulinogenic index derived from an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (risk allele homozygotes have half the insulin response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> of noncarriers, P = 0.003) but not with increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that TCF7L2 variants may act through insulin secretion to increase the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
