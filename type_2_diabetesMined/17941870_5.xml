<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A potentially important new drug for treating type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33954">tagatose</z:chebi>, is now in phase 3 clinical trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The history, development, additional health benefits, mechanisms of action and the potential for the drug are presented in context with a review of the rapidly growing epidemic of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and treatments for it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An epimer of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28757">fructose</z:chebi>, the natural <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18133">hexose</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33954">tagatose</z:chebi> was originally developed by Spherix Incorporated (formerly Biospherics Inc.) as a low-calorie sugar substitute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only 20% of orally ingested <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33954">tagatose</z:chebi> is fully metabolized, principally in the liver, following a metabolic pathway identical to that of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28757">fructose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following a decade of studies, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33954">tagatose</z:chebi> became generally recognized as safe for use in foods and beverages under US FDA regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The simple sugar is commercially produced by isomerization of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="28260">galactose</z:chebi>, which is prepared from <z:chebi fb="8" ids="17716">lactose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Early human studies suggested <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33954">tagatose</z:chebi> as a potential <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drug through its beneficial effects on postprandial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020459" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperinsulinaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A subsequent 14-month trial confirmed its potential for treating type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33954">tagatose</z:chebi> showed promise for inducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and raising <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi>, both important to the control of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and constituting benefits independent of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33954">tagatose</z:chebi> was shown to be an <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> and a prebiotic, both properties cited in the maintenance and promotion of health </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No current therapies for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> provide these multiple health benefits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The predominant side effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33954">tagatose</z:chebi> are gastrointestinal disturbances associated with excessive consumption, generally accommodated within 1- to 2-week period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The health and use potentials for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33954">tagatose</z:chebi> (branded Naturlose((R)) for this use) are given with respect to current type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> drugs and markets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Under an FDA-affirmed protocol, Spherix is currently conducting a phase 3 trial to evaluate a placebo-subtracted treatment effect based on a decrease in HbA(1c) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Side effects, contraindications and possibly beneficial new findings will be carefully monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It is hoped that early results of the trial may become available by mid-2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>If a subsequent NDA is successful, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33954">tagatose</z:chebi> may fill a major health need </plain></SENT>
