<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of the electrocardiograms (ECGs) recorded at baseline and after 2 years for the first 1,004 type 2 diabetic individuals to be randomized in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">Rosiglitazone</z:chebi> Evaluated for Cardiac Outcomes and Regulation of Glycemia in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> (RECORD) study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ECGs suitable for analysis were obtained from 669 participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of unrecognized Q-wave <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> at baseline was 1.9% (n = 13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of unrecognized Q-wave <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> at the end of 2 years of follow-up was 1.5/1,000-person-years (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One-third (13 of 39) of prevalent and one-quarter (2 of 8) of incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarctions</z:hpo> were unrecognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although the prevalence and incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> was low, unrecognized Q-wave <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarctions</z:hpo> made up a substantial proportion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> events </plain></SENT>
