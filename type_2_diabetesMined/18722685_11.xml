<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we investigate whether plasma FGF-21 level is different in patients with new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001953'>diabetic ketosis</z:hpo> (T2DK) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixty-eight patients with T2DM, 41 subjects with T2DK, and 52 sex- and age-matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls participated in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma FGF-21 levels were measured with a radioimmunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relationship between plasma FGF-21 levels and anthropometric and metabolic parameters was also analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma FGF-21 levels were higher in patients with T2DK and T2DM than in controls (4.05+/-0.18microg/L and 2.82+/-0.14microg/L vs. 2.28+/-0.16microg/L, P&lt;0.01 and P&lt;0.05, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fasting plasma FGF-21 was found to correlate positively and significantly with SBP, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi>, FBG, 2hPBG, HbA(1)c, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> and FFA, but negatively with fasting plasma insulin, 2hIns and HOMA(IS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multiple regression analysis showed that <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi>, WHR, 2hIns, 2hPBG and FFA were independent to the factors influencing plasma FGF-21 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increasing concentrations of FGF-21 were independently and significantly associated with T2DM and T2DK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The present work suggests that FGF-21 may play a role in the pathogenesis of T2DM and T2DK </plain></SENT>
