<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: MEDLINE, Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC), and Nursing and Allied Health databases were searched for English-language articles published between 1980 and 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Studies were original articles reporting the results of randomized controlled trials of the effectiveness of self-management training in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Relevant data on study design, population demographics, interventions, outcomes, methodological quality, and external validity were tabulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interventions were categorized based on educational focus (information, lifestyle behaviors, mechanical skills, and coping skills), and outcomes were classified as knowledge, attitudes, and self-care skills; lifestyle behaviors, psychological outcomes, and quality of life; glycemic control; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> risk factors; and economic measures and health service utilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 72 studies described in 84 articles were identified for this review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Positive effects of self-management training on knowledge, frequency and accuracy of self-monitoring of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, self-reported dietary habits, and glycemic control were demonstrated in studies with short follow-up (&lt;6 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Effects of interventions on <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, physical activity, weight, and blood pressure were variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With longer follow-up, interventions that used regular reinforcement throughout follow-up were sometimes effective in improving glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Educational interventions that involved patient collaboration may be more effective than didactic interventions in improving glycemic control, weight, and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No studies demonstrated the effectiveness of self-management training on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>-related events or mortality; no economic analyses included indirect costs; few studies examined health-care utilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Performance, selection, attrition, and detection bias were common in studies reviewed, and external generalizability was often limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Evidence supports the effectiveness of self-management training in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, particularly in the short term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further research is needed to assess the effectiveness of self-management interventions on sustained glycemic control, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> risk factors, and ultimately, microvascular and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> and quality of life </plain></SENT>
