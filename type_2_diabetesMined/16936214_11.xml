<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Linkage of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> to chromosome 1q21-q23 is well replicated across populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In an initial 50-kb marker map (580 markers) across the linked region, one of the two strongest associations observed in Utah Caucasians was at marker rs1503814 (P &lt; 0.00001 in pools, P &lt; 0.004 in individuals) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on this association, we typed additional markers and screened for sequence variation in the nearby DUSP12 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The strongest associations mapped to a highly conserved nongenic sequence just telomeric to rs1503814 and extended 10 kb telomeric through the DUSP12 gene and into the 5' end of the adjacent ATF6 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No coding variant could explain the association in the DUSP12 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An extended haplotype encompassing markers from -8,379 to +10,309 bp relative to the ATG start was more common in Caucasian case (0.381) than control subjects (0.285, P = 0.005) and was uniquely tagged by a 194-bp allele at either of two simple tandem repeat variants or by the T allele at marker +7,580 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Markers -8,379 and +7,580 were nominally associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in African-American subjects (P &lt; 0.05), but with different alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Marker rs1503814 was strongly associated with postchallenge insulin levels among family members (P = 0.000002), but sequence variation in this region was not associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in three other populations of European ancestry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that sequences in or upstream of DUSP12 may contribute to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility, but the lack of replication suggests a small effect size </plain></SENT>
