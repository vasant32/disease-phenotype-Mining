<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Totally 2370 and 1619 workers without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and IFG at baseline, respectively, who were +35 years old were followed up during 2001-2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence rates (95% CI) were 13.6 (8.4-22.3) and 6.4 (4.5-9.1) per 1000 PYs, respectively, for men and women, while those of the IFG were 37.8 (26.3-54.4) and 23.6 (19.3-29.0) per 1000 PYs, respectively, for both genders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Baseline FBS predicted future IFG risk even at the levels as low as 63-70 mg/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The OR (95% CI) of IFG for those with baseline FPG of 63-70, 71-80, and &gt;80 mg/dl-compared to those with baseline FPG &lt; or =62 mg/dl-were 2.51 (1.12-5.64), 5.39 (2.51-11.56), and 8.30 (3.67-18.75), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Future <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk was observed only in those with baseline FPG of 96 mg/dl or higher, with the OR (95% CI) of 6.0 (2.29-15.75) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, baseline FPG even at the level as low as 63-70 mg/dl predicts future IFG risk among a hospital employee group in Thailand, while increased <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk was found only in those at the FBS level of &gt; or =96 mg/dl </plain></SENT>
