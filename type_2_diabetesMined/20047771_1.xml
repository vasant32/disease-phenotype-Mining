<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the effect of leisure-time physical activity on the incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2DM) in patients with manifest <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial disease</z:e>, or poorly controlled risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined 3940 patients with manifest <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, aged 55.2+/-12.2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Leisure-time physical activity was measured by a questionnaire and metabolic equivalent (MET) hours per week (h/wk) were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Incident T2DM was evaluated by a specific <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Most patients (65%) were physically inactive (0METh/wk), 12% were insufficiently physically active (0-10.5METh/wk) and 23% were sufficiently physically active (&gt;or=10.5METh/wk) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During a mean follow-up of 4.7 years, 194 (5%) incident cases of T2DM occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sufficiently physically active patients had a lower incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (hazard ratio (HR) 0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.37-0.83) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients who were physically active and not-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (BMI&lt;30kg/m(2)) were at the lowest risk for developing T2DM (HR 0.18, 95% CI 0.12-0.28) compared with patients who were physically inactive and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Leisure-time physical activity is associated with a decreased risk of T2DM in patients with manifest <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial disease</z:e>, or poorly controlled risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The combination of physical activity and non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> is associated with an even lower risk of the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than the sum of their independent, protective effect </plain></SENT>
