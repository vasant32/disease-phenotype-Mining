<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to evaluate the predictive value of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> mellitus (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e>), <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-associated autoantibodies, and other factors for development of clinical <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> later in life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this case-control study the presence of autoantibodies was studied in 435 women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> and in healthy matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The need for exogenous insulin during <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> group, the mean follow-up period was 5.7 years and in the control group 6.1 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e>, 20 (4.6%) developed type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 23 (5.3%) developed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, whereas none of the control subjects became diabetic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two-thirds of those who developed type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> tested positive initially for islet cell antibodies (ICAs), whereas 56% of them had autoantibodies to GAD (GADAs) and 38% to the protein tyrosine phosphatase-related IA-2 molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only 2 of the 23 women who presented later with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> tested positive for autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>According to multivariate analysis, initial age &lt; or =30 years, the need for insulin treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e>, and antibody positivity for ICAs and GADAs were associated with increased risk for clinical type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Pregnancy seems to identify women who are at risk of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> later in life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>About 10% of Finnish women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> will develop <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> over the next 6 years; nearly half of them develop type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the other half type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Age &lt; or =30 years, the need for insulin treatment during pregnancy, and positivity for ICAs and GADAs confer a high risk of subsequent progression to type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in women affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> </plain></SENT>
