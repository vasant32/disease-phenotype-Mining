<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to examine risk factors for the electrophysiologic severity of diabetic peripheral sensorimotor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001271'>polyneuropathy</z:hpo> (DSP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 97 patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (25 patients) or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (72 patients) were included in this cross-sectional study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nerve conduction studies (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi>) were performed on median motor and sensory nerves, peroneal motor nerve, and both sural nerves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The severity of DSP was expressed as the sum of nerve conduction velocities (SNCV) and the score of distal amplitudes (SAMP) of the above-mentioned nerves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>General linear models were used to assess the relationship between overall severity of DSP as well as the severity of lower extremity, upper extremity, motor nerve, or sensory nerve involvement and various risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: GHb was significantly related to both SNCV and SAMP in univariate and multivariate regression analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This relationship was present in models where GHb was handled either as a continuous variable or as a categorical variable with highest significance level, with a GHb cutoff level of 9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The difference in NCV for individual nerves in patients with good-to-moderate glycemic control (GHb &lt; or =9%) and those with poor glycemic control (GHb &gt; or =9%) ranged from 1.8 to 3.6 m/s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SAMP was also significantly lower in patients with poor control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SNCV was also significantly related in multivariate analysis to duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and height, while SAMP was related to duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, age, and male sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The severity of DSP expressed by electrophysiologic criteria was significantly related to glycemic control in a study including patients with type 1 or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Based on the results of the present study, it might be predicted that better diabetic control would decrease the severity of DSP </plain></SENT>
