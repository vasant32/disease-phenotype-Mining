<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As these glycaemic and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> parameters are major cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, we assessed their separate contribution to the reduced incidence of CV outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients (n = 5238) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and macrovascular disease were randomized to 45 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Relationships among treatment, outcome (time to first event of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) and 10 laboratory measurements and vital signs were investigated using log-linear models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Continuous variable measurements (percent changes from baseline to average of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> postbaseline values prior to censoring) were made discrete by categorizing into tertiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Log-linear models were fitted to multiway tables of discrete data and analysis of deviance used to summarize sources of variation in the data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> treatment was associated with a decrease in HbA1c and an increase in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>), only the change from baseline <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> predicted the outcome (Ï‡(2) = 28.89, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No other variables, including HbA1c, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> and systolic blood pressure, showed significant direct associations with outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When the analysis was extended to include baseline <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> use, this was associated with an improved outcome independently of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This post hoc analysis suggests that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>, but probably not HbA1c, is a driver of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>'s favourable influence on CV outcome </plain></SENT>
