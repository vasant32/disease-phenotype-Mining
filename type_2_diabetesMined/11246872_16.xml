<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prohormone convertase enzymes PC3 (also known as PC1) and PC2 are localized to beta-cell secretory granules with proIAPP and proinsulin and are responsible for proinsulin processing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine whether PC2 might be essential for proIAPP processing, we performed Western blot analysis of freshly isolated islets from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mice and mice lacking active PC2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As expected, the primary species of IAPP immunoreactivity in islets from <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice was fully processed (4-kDa) IAPP, with only small amounts of the 8-kDa precursor (unprocessed proIAPP) present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Islets from heterozygous PC2 null mice were identical to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> animals, suggesting that half the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> complement of PC2 is sufficient for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> proIAPP processing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By contrast, in islets from homozygous PC2 null mice, the predominant IAPP-immunoreactive form was of intermediate size (approximately 6 kDa), with no detectable mature IAPP and slightly elevated amounts of the 8-kDa precursor form present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, in the absence of PC2, proIAPP processing appears to be blocked at the level of a proIAPP conversion intermediate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence of pancreas sections and immunoblotting using antisera raised to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29337,29340">NH2-</z:chebi> and COOH-terminal flanking regions of mouse proIAPP demonstrated that the 6-kDa intermediate form was an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29318,29339">NH2</z:chebi>-terminally extended proIAPP conversion intermediate (processed only at the COOH-terminus) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that PC2 is essential for processing of proIAPP at the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29318,29339">NH2</z:chebi>-terminal cleavage site in vivo and that PC3 is likely only capable of processing proIAPP at the COOH-terminal cleavage site </plain></SENT>
