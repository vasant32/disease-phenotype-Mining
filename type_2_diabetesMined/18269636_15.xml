<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a 6-month, prospective, multinational, multiethnic observational study involving 21 977 patients from 13 countries (India, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Qatar, Romania, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were transferred to BIAsp 30 with or without oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs (OADs) from prior treatment with OAD (n = 8583), insulin (n = 5942), OAD + insulin (n = 4673) or diet (i.e. treatment naive) (n = 1707) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One thousand and seventy-two patients had incomplete or no information on previous treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At 3 and 6 months, significant reductions from baseline were observed in the mean <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c) (HbA(1c)) (-1.33 and -1.81%), fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (-3.02 and -3.74 mmol/l) and postprandial plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (-4.76 and -5.82 mmol/l) (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significantly greater proportion of patients achieved target HbA(1c) of less than 7% at 3 months (15.3%) and 6 months (27.7%) compared with baseline (4.8%) (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, the mean HbA(1c) at 6 months was lowered in patients regardless of prior treatment: -2.15% (OAD), -1.45% (insulin), -1.47% (OAD + insulin) and -2.35% (treatment naive) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the overall cohort, the rate of total <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> was reduced from 5.4 events per patient-year at baseline to 2.2 events per patient-year at study end (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among prior treatment subgroups, the rates of total <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> were reduced from 2.5 to 2.1 events per patient-year in the OAD group, from 9.6 to 2.2 events per patient-year in the insulin group and from 7.6 to 2.5 events per patient-year in the OAD + insulin group but were increased from 1.0 to 1.8 events per patient-year in the treatment-naive group (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were 444 adverse drug reactions (ADRs), including 13 serious ADRs: <z:hpo ids='HP_0009125'>lipodystrophy</z:hpo> (three events), symptoms of generalized hypersensitivity (two events), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> painful <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> (one event), worsening of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (one event), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> (one event) and unspecified ADRs (five events) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The use of BIAsp 30 monotherapy or in combination with OADs in clinical practice was effective and safe in patients with poorly controlled type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
