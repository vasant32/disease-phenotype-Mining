<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Numerous new genes have recently been identified in genome-wide association studies for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most are highly expressed in beta cells and presumably play important roles in their function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, these genes account for only a small proportion of total risk and there are likely to be additional candidate genes not detected by current methodology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We therefore investigated islets from the polygenic New Zealand mouse (NZL) model of diet-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta cell dysfunction</z:hpo> to identify novel genes and pathways that may play a role in the pathogenesis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: NZL mice were fed a diabetogenic high-fat diet (HF) or a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-protective carbohydrate-free HF diet (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pancreatic islets were isolated by laser capture microdissection (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCM</z:e>) and subjected to genome-wide transcriptome analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetic state</z:e>, 2,109 islet transcripts were differentially regulated (&gt;1.5-fold) between HF and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> diets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the genes identified, 39 (e.g. Cacna1d, Chd2, Clip2, Igf2bp2, Dach1, Tspan8) correlated with data from the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Genetics Initiative and Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium genome-wide scans for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, thus validating our approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HF diet induced early changes in gene expression associated with increased cell-cycle progression, proliferation and differentiation of islet cells, and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> (e.g. Cdkn1b, Tmem27, Pax6, Cat, Prdx4 and Txnip) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, pathway analysis identified oxidative phosphorylation as the predominant gene-set that was significantly upregulated in response to the diabetogenic HF diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We demonstrated that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCM</z:e> of pancreatic islet cells in combination with transcriptional profiling can be successfully used to identify novel candidate genes for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our data strongly implicate <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in disease progression </plain></SENT>
