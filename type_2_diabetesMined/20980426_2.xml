<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Fifty-nine diabetic subjects were randomized to a control group receiving standard lifestyle recommendations or an intervention group assigned to three supervised walking sessions per week and counseling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Changes in metabolic features, weight, 6-min walk test, prescription of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> medications, and overall physical activity were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Functional capacity and overall physical activity were higher in the intervention group, whereas metabolic changes were not different between groups after 4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, in subjects who attended at least 50% of scheduled walking sessions, changes in A1C and fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> were greater than in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Discontinuation or reduction of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs occurred in 33% of these patients versus 5% of control subjects (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Supervised walking may be beneficial in diabetic subjects, but metabolic improvement requires adequate compliance </plain></SENT>
