<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Recent studies have proved that blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>) retards the progression of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, whereas hyporeninemia is known as a typical state in diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to determine whether expression levels of <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> differ between nondiabetic and diabetic renal tissues with accurate quantitative method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Subjects were 66 nondiabetic and 8 diabetic patients with biopsy-proven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The eight diabetic subjects suffered from type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Renal histology revealed typical diffuse or nodular lesions with linear IgG deposit on immunofluorescent staining and thickened basement membrane on electronic microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Total <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> from a small part of the renal cortical biopsy specimens was reverse-transcribed, and the resultant cDNA was amplified for new major components of <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> (i.e., renin, renin receptor, angiotensinogen, ACE, ACE2, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> type 1 receptor, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> type 2 receptor) and measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among these components, a significant upregulation was observed in the ACE gene in diabetic renal tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that renal tissue <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> might be activated in the respect that ACE gene expression is upregulated in spite of a tendency to low renin expression in type 2 diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
