<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In control subjects, a pair of arginine injections (75 mg/kg) at a 30-min interval resulted in 20% reduction of peak and integrated insulin responses to the second injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetic patients and in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects, the inhibitory effect of repeated arginine stimuli was abolished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Healthy subjects were made acutely hyperglycaemic (9.3 +/- 0.3 mmol/l) by the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> clamp technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This induced a three- to fivefold greater insulin response to arginine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared to the response of diabetic subjects with similar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e>, the control subjects secreted four to nine times more insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When the arginine stimulation was repeated 30 min later, no inhibition was observed, the second insulin response being instead augmented 1.5- to 1.8-fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that (1) the insulin response to arginine is markedly reduced in Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; (2) arginine-induced time-dependent inhibition of insulin release is abolished in patients with minimal to moderate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e>; (3) this is probably due to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> synergistic action of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and arginine on the B cell; (4) time-dependent inhibition of insulin release may be a protective mechanism against insulin oversecretion following repetitive stimulation of the pancreas; its abolition in hyperglycaemic states may be a compensatory mechanism, allowing substantial increases in insulin output </plain></SENT>
