<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>beta-Cell mass reduction has been reported but remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A preliminary study of a large series of patients has demonstrated that in most, the beta-cell defect is not related to a decreased beta-cell mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Amyloid deposits are observed in the islets of some type 2 diabetic patients but also in normoglycemic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because it has been claimed that these deposits interfere with beta-cell function, we evaluated in situ the effect of insular amyloid deposits on beta-cell transcription and translation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pancreases were obtained at autopsy from 28 normoglycemic patients and 41 type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Staining with hemaluneosin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34653">Congo red</z:chebi> was used to analyze the general features of the islets and the presence of amyloid deposits, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry for proinsulin was performed with an antibody recognizing the junction between B-chain and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, thus specifically labeling the Golgi area where proinsulin is produced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In seven patients, we evaluated insulin gene transcription by in situ hybridization of proinsulin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> combined with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34653">Congo red</z:chebi> staining, and we evaluated insulin storage by double immunostaining for insulin and amylin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In many type 2 diabetic patients, the islets appeared entirely <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Amyloid deposits were found in 57% of diabetic subjects and 33% of normoglycemic age-matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The percentage of amyloid-infiltrated islets varied from 0.4 to 74% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>beta-Cells from amyloid-containing islets still had specific Golgi proinsulin labeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> type 2 diabetic patients, the number of beta-cells with abnormal expression of proinsulin in the whole cytoplasm was significantly higher than in normoglycemic control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Proinsulin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was significantly reduced in islets with amyloid deposits when compared with amyloid-free islets, but the mean reduction did not exceed 16% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Insulin was still present in the beta-cells of amyloid-containing islets, and its amount, estimated by measurement of the insulin-labeling optical density, was not statistically different from that in amyloid-free islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, even in amyloid-containing islets, beta-cells maintain active insulin transcription and translation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> insulin storage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Taking into account that in most cases only a small proportion of islets are infiltrated by amyloid, the limited reduction in proinsulin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> is unlikely to play a major role in the pathogenesis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
