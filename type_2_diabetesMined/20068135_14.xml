<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Acylated ghrelin (AG) is a diabetogenic and orexigenic gastric <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These properties are not shared by the most abundant circulating form, which is unacylated (UAG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An altered UAG/AG profile together with an impairment of circulating endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) bioavailability were found in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on previous evidence for the beneficial cardiovascular effects of AG and UAG, we investigated their potential to revert <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-associated defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Healthy human subjects, individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and ob/ob mice were AG or UAG infused </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EPC mobilization in patients and mice was evaluated, and the underlying molecular mechanisms were investigated in bone marrow stromal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recovered EPCs were also evaluated for the activity of senescence regulatory pathways and for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase activation by knocking down p47(phox) and Rac1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, UAG modulation of human EPC vasculogenic potential was investigated in an in vivo mouse model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Neither AG nor UAG had any effect in healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, systemic administration of UAG, but not AG, prevented <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-induced EPC damage by modulating the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase regulatory protein Rac1 and improved the vasculogenic potential both in individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and in ob/ob mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, unlike AG, UAG facilitated the recovery of bone marrow EPC mobilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Crucial to EPC mobilization by UAG was the rescue of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) phosphorylation by Akt, as UAG treatment was ineffective in eNOS knockout mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Consistently, EPCs expressed specific UAG-binding sites, not recognized by AG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data provide the rationale for clinical applications of UAG in pathologic settings where AG fails </plain></SENT>
