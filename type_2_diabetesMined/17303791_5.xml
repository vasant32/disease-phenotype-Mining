<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, concern exists about the possible toxic effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50369">chromium picolinate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the effect of <z:chebi fb="74" ids="28073">chromium</z:chebi> treatment in the form of <z:chebi fb="74" ids="28073">chromium</z:chebi> yeast on glycemic control in a Western population of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were being treated with oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this 6-month, double-blind study, patients with moderate glycemic control, being treated with oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi>, were randomly assigned to receive either a placebo or treatment with 400 microg of <z:chebi fb="74" ids="28073">chromium</z:chebi> daily in the form of <z:chebi fb="74" ids="28073">chromium</z:chebi> yeast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary efficacy parameter was a change in A1C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Secondary end points were changes in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile, BMI, blood pressure, body fat, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No differences were found for the change in A1C between the intervention and placebo groups, nor were any differences found between the groups for the secondary end points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence that <z:chebi fb="74" ids="28073">chromium</z:chebi> in the form of <z:chebi fb="74" ids="28073">chromium</z:chebi> yeast is effective in improving glycemic control in Western patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who are taking oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
