<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Downregulation of its activity is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it is unknown whether hepatic Gck expression is influenced by age and is involved in ageing-mediated <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and whether the degree of methylation of the hepatic Gck promoter is correlated with the transcription of Gck </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To address the question, we evaluated hepatic Gck transcription and promoter methylation in young (14 weeks), adult (40 weeks) and aged (80 weeks) rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Hepatic <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi>, Gck expression and the kinase activity of GCK were measured in three age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The CpG methylation status was determined by both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulphite</z:chebi> direct sequencing and clone sequencing of the PCR amplificates of Gck promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The causal relationship between Gck methylation and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was confirmed by treating rat primary hepatocytes with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine</z:chebi> (5-Aza-CdR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We have shown an age-associated decline in hepatic <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi>, Gck expression levels and the kinase activity of hepatic GCK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The eleven CpG sites studied displayed age-related progressive methylation changes in hepatic Gck promoter, which were confirmed by two methods: direct and clone sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After 5-Aza-CdR treatment of rat primary hepatocytes, there was a fourfold increase in Gck expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our results demonstrate that an age-related increase in methylation is negatively associated with hepatic Gck expression, suggesting that DNA methylation could be involved in increasing age-dependent susceptibility to hepatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, the epigenetic modification of the hepatic Gck promoter may represent an important marker for diabetogenic potential during the ageing process </plain></SENT>
