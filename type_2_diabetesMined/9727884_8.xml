<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to develop a third version of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Attitude Scale (DAS-3) that is congruent with current scientific knowledge about <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, has improved subscale internal reliability scores, and is shorter than the earlier versions of this instrument </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The second DAS was revised and rewritten by a panel of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> experts, including patients, associated with the University of Michigan <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Research and Training Center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The revised version of the instrument was sent to physicians, nurses, dietitians, and patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Completed and usable questionnaires were obtained from 384 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 321 physicians, 540 nurses, and 569 dietitians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The total number of surveys used for these analyses was 1,814 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study resulted in a revised DAS with 33 items and five discrete subscales </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The subscales were attitudes toward the following: 1) need for special training to provide <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care, 2) seriousness of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 3) value of tight <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control, 4) pyschosocial impact of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and 5) attitude toward patient autonomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, the subscale reliabilities of the DAS-3 were superior to the earlier versions of the scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The DAS-3 is a valid and reliable general measure of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related attitudes and is most suitable for comparisons across different groups of health care professionals and/or patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The DAS-3 is also suitable for the evaluation of patient and/or professional education programs if those programs focus on the specific topic areas measured by the five DAS-3 subscales </plain></SENT>
