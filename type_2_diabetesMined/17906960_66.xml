<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since ER stress has been associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta cell dysfunction</z:hpo>, we studied several features of beta cell ER in human type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Pancreatic samples and/or isolated islets from non-diabetic controls (ND) and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients were evaluated for insulin secretion, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> (electron microscopy and ELISA), morphometric ER assessment (electron microscopy), and expression of ER stress markers in beta cell prepared by laser capture microdissection and in isolated islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Insulin release was lower and beta cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> higher in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than ND islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ER density volume was significantly increased in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> beta cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression of alpha-mannosidase (also known as mannosidase, alpha, class 1A, member 1) and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> glucosyl transferase like 2 (UGCGL2), assessed by microarray and/or real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), differed between ND and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> beta cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expression of immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein (BiP, also known as heat shock 70 kDa protein 5 [<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-regulated protein, 78 kDa] [HSPA5]), X-box binding protein 1 (XBP-1, also known as XBP1) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP, also known as damage-inducible transcript 3 [DDIT3]) was not higher in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> beta cell or isolated islets cultured at 5.5 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (microarray and real-time RT-PCR) than in ND samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When islets were cultured for 24 h at 11.1 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, there was induction of BiP and XBP-1 in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> islets but not in ND islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Beta cell in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> showed modest signs of ER stress when studied in pancreatic samples or isolated islets maintained at physiological <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, exposure to <z:mp ids='MP_0005559'>increased glucose levels</z:mp> induced ER stress markers in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> islet cells, which therefore may be more susceptible to ER stress induced by metabolic perturbations </plain></SENT>
