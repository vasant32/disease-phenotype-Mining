<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A characteristic and dominant feature of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is a reduction in beta-cell function that is associated with a decrease in beta-cell volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A decline in the first-phase insulin response following intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> administration can be demonstrated as the fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration increases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This response is completely absent before the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> threshold that defines <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> has been reached and at a time when beta-cells are clearly still present, implying that a functional beta-cell lesion has to exist independent of beta-cell loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surgical or chemical reductions of up to 65% of beta-cell volume demonstrate that functional adaptation of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> beta-cell prevents a rise in fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> or reduction in first-phase insulin response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the ability of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> to potentiate the beta-cell's response to non-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> secretagogues is reduced and is more closely associated with the reduction in beta-cell volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The future, in terms of prevention and treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, lies in the ability to prevent and revert both beta-cell loss and dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, until beta-cell volume can be quantified reliably and non-invasively, we will need to rely on the ability of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> to potentiate insulin release as the best surrogate estimate of the number of beta-cells </plain></SENT>
