<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this population-based cross-sectional study, information was linked from the Swedish National <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Register, Prescribed Drug Register and Patient Register </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>T2DM patients with non-pharmacological treatment and T2DM patients continuously using the 12 most common pharmacological treatment regimens were included in the study (n = 163121) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were statistically significant differences in clinical characteristics between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with insulin-based treatment regimens had the longest duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> than the T2DM-population in general </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The proportion of patients reaching HbA1c ≤ 7% varied between 70.1% (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>) and 25.0% [premixed insulin (PMI) + SU) in patients with pharmacological treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>84.8% of the patients with non-pharmacological treatment reached target </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared to patients on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, patients on other pharmacological treatments had a lower likelihood, with hazard ratios ranging from 0.58; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.54-0.63 to 0.97;0.94-0.99, of having HbA1c ≤ 7% (adjusted for covariates) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients on insulin-based treatments had the lowest likelihood, while non-pharmacological treatment was associated with an increased likelihood of having HbA1c ≤ 7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This nation-wide study shows insufficiently reached treatment goals for <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA1c) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients on insulin-based treatment regimens had the longest duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> and the highest proportions of patients not reaching HbA1c target </plain></SENT>
