<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to compare the impact of isolated type-2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and co-existence of both on LV longitudinal systolic performance, with particular focus on their potential interaction effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study population included 163 consecutive patients: 84 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, 36 with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and 43 who have both <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; 70 healthy controls were also recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Systolic mitral annulus velocity (S(m)) by Tissue Doppler and left atrioventricular plane displacement (AVPD) by M-mode were measured in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: AVPD was similarly reduced in hypertensives (13.2±2.2mm) and diabetics (13.5±2.3mm) when compared with the controls (15.1±2.4mm), and further depressed in diabetic hypertensives (11.5±3.0mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similar results were found for S(m) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>General linear model analysis revealed no significant interaction terms between <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Normotensive diabetics and nondiabetic hypertensives show comparable <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in LV longitudinal systolic indices when compared with age- and gender-matched healthy controls; the co-existence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> leads to further impairment in LV longitudinal systolic function in an additive manner </plain></SENT>
