<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Participants (n = 2,751) were genotyped for 73 SNPs previously associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>/insulin concentrations, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> or <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels, from which five genetic risk scores (one for each of the four traits and one combining <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> SNPs) were computed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients and non-diabetic controls (n = 1,327/1,424) were identified using medical records in addition to an independent oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Model 1, including only SNPs associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, had a discriminative power of 0.591 (p &lt; 1.00 x 10(-20) vs null model) as estimated by the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC AUC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Model 2, including only fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>/insulin SNPs, had a significantly higher discriminative power than the null model (ROC AUC 0.543; p = 9.38 x 10(-6) vs null model), but lower discriminative power than model 1 (p = 5.92 x 10(-5)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Model 3, with only <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-associated SNPs, had significantly higher discriminative power than the null model (ROC AUC 0.565; p = 1.44 x 10(-9)) and was not statistically different from model 1 (p = 0.083) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ROC AUC of model 4, which included only <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> SNPs, was 0.557 (p = 2.30 x 10(-7) vs null model) and smaller than model 1 (p = 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, the model including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> SNPs yielded a significant improvement in discriminative power compared with the null model (p &lt; 1.0 x 10(-20)) and model 1 (p = 1.32 x 10(-5)); its ROC AUC was 0.626 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Adding SNPs previously associated with fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> to a genetic risk score for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> significantly increases the power to discriminate between people with and without clinically manifest type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with a model including only conventional type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> loci </plain></SENT>
