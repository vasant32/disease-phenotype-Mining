<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: We had previously demonstrated that vascular and neural dysfunction in <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats is progressive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we sought to determine whether monotherapy of ZDF rats can reverse the vascular and nerve defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: ZDF rats at 16 weeks of age were treated for 12 weeks with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35457">angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor</z:chebi> enalapril, the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30314">alpha-lipoic acid</z:chebi>, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38545">rosuvastatin</z:chebi> or the PPARgamma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Vasodilation of epineurial arterioles was measured by videomicroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endoneurial blood flow (EBF) was measured by hydrogen clearance, and nerve conduction velocity was measured following electrical stimulation of motor or sensory nerves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV), sensory nerve conduction velocity (SNCV) (70 and 77% of control, respectively), EBF (64% of control), and vascular relaxation in response to <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> (50% of control) and calcitonin gene-related <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (CGRP; 73% of control) are impaired in ZDF rats at 28 weeks of age compared with lean littermate controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment with enalapril and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30314">alpha-lipoic acid</z:chebi> attenuated the decrease in MNCV and SNCV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Enalapril, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30314">alpha-lipoic acid</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> treatment of ZDF rats were partially effective in improving endothelium-dependent vascular dysfunction as measured by vascular relaxation in response to <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The same drugs also attenuated the decrease in EBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, impairment in vascular relaxation in response to CGRP was improved with only <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30314">alpha-lipoic acid</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38545">rosuvastatin</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The increase in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> and nitrotyrosine levels in vascular tissue was attenuated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of monotherapy treatment of ZDF rats using different classes of drugs for vascular and neural dysfunction once complications have developed did not achieve expected levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This could be because of the complex aetiology of vascular and neural disease in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
