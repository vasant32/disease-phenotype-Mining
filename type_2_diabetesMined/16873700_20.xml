<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>beta-Cell mass is approximately 50% deficient in IFG and approximately 65% deficient in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To establish the effect of a approximately 50% deficit in beta-cell mass on carbohydrate metabolism, we performed a approximately 50% partial pancreatectomy versus sham surgery in 14 dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Insulin secretion was quantified from insulin concentrations measured in the portal vein at 1-min sampling intervals under basal conditions, after a 30-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and during a hyperglycemic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity was measured by a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp combined with isotope dilution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Partial pancreatectomy resulted in IFG and IGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After partial pancreatectomy both basal and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion were decreased through the mechanism of a selective approximately 50 and approximately 80% deficit in insulin pulse mass, respectively (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These defects in insulin secretion were partially offset by decreased hepatic insulin clearance (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Partial pancreatectomy also caused a approximately 40% decrease in insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal (P &lt; 0.05), insulin sensitivity after partial pancreatectomy being related to insulin pulse amplitude (r = 0.9, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that a approximately 50% deficit in beta-cell mass can recapitulate the alterations in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-mediated insulin secretion and insulin action in humans with IFG and IGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data support a mechanistic role of a deficit in beta-cell mass in the evolution of IFG/IGT and subsequently type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
