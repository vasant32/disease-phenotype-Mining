<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Expression of adiponectin decreases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At present, the mechanisms responsible for negatively regulating adiponectin expression in adipocytes are poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this investigation, we analyzed the effects of 5' serial deletion constructs on the murine adiponectin promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we identified the repressor region located between -472 and -313 bp of the promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Removal of the putative nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFATs) binding site increased the promoter activity, and overexpression of NFATc4 reduced the promoter activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22986">calcium ionophore</z:chebi> A23187, an activator of NFAT, reduced <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> as well as promoter activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The binding of NFATc4 to the promoter was associated with increased recruitment of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylase 1 and reduced acetylation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H3 at the promoter site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, binding of activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) to the putative activator protein-1 site located adjacent to the NFAT binding site also repressed the promoter activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment with thapsigargin, an inducer of ATF3, reduced both <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and promoter activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Importantly, the binding activities of NFATc4 and ATF3, increased significantly in white adipose tissues of ob/ob and db/db mice compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Taken together, this study demonstrates for the first time that NFATc4 and ATF3 function as negative regulators of adiponectin gene expression, which may play critical roles in downregulating adiponectin expression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
