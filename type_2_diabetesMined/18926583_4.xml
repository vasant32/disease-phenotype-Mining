<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pattern of usage of anti-diabetic treatment and corresponding glycemic control was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OAD failure was defined as the need to add insulin to maintain glycemic target (glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, HbA(1c) level&lt;7%) with or without continuation of OAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 4109 [54.4%] women and 3440 [45.6%] men (age: median 57.0 years; range 13-92 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean HbA(1c) level was 7.7+/-1.8% with 39.7% attaining glycemic target </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Long disease duration was associated with more complex regimens and the respective rates of OAD failure requiring insulin use were 23.7%, 39.3%, 57.1% and 75.9% in those with disease duration &lt;5 years, 5-9.9 years, 10-19.9 years and &gt; or =20 years (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, in a clinic-based type 2 diabetic population, 39.7% attained glycemic target with HbA(1c)&lt;7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Long disease duration and complexity of treatment regimens were associated with suboptimal glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Early intensification of therapy and system improvement are needed to enhance the effectiveness of these drugs in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
