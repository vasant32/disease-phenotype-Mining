<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Longitudinal data from the Hispanic Established Population for the Epidemiologic Study of the Elderly (EPESE) survey were used to examine the main effects and interaction effects of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and depressive symptoms (measured with the Center for Epidemiologic Study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo>) or clinical diagnostic criteria (measured with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Module) on the development of macrovascular complications (including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e>), microvascular complications (including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputations</z:mpath>), functional disability, and mortality over 7 years in a sample of 2,830 Mexican Americans aged &gt;or=65 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The interaction of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> was found to be synergistic, predicting greater mortality, greater incidence of both macro- and microvascular complications, and greater incidence of disability in activities of daily living, even when controlling for sociodemographic characteristics such as sex, age, education, acculturation, and marital status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Importantly, this interaction was found to predict not only greater incidence but also earlier incidence of adverse events in older adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Whether a marker for underlying disease severity, an indicator of diminished self-care motivation, or the result of physiologic changes, the interaction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> has a synergistic effect on the health of older Mexican Americans, increasing the risk for poor outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This is of particular clinical importance because although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> is often underrecognized in older adults, effective treatment is available and can result in improved medical outcomes </plain></SENT>
