<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IL-6 null mice show low energy expenditure, but the effect of the variants of the IL-6 gene on energy expenditure has not been previously studied in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we investigated the effect of the C-174G promoter polymorphism of the IL-6 gene on energy expenditure, measured by indirect calorimetry in healthy Finnish subjects (n = 124) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also measured insulin sensitivity by the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects with the C-174C genotype of the IL-6 gene had significantly lower energy expenditure than subjects with the G-174C or G-174G genotypes both in fasting (CC 13.68 +/- 1.98, CG 14.73 +/- 1.57, GG 14.81 +/- 2.01 kcal x kg(-1) x min(-1); P = 0.012) and during the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp (CC 15.24 +/- 2.05, CG 16.62 +/- 2.06, GG 16.66 +/- 2.50 kcal x kg(-1) x min(-1); P = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, subjects homozygous for the C allele had lower rates of whole-body <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake than carriers of the G allele (CC 50.95 +/- 13.91, CG 59.40 +/- 14.17, GG 59.21 +/- 15.93 micro mol x kg(-1) x min(-1); P = 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rates of both oxidative (P = 0.013) and nonoxidative (P = 0.016) <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal were significantly affected by the IL-6 promoter polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the C-174C promoter polymorphism of the IL-6 gene influences energy expenditure and insulin sensitivity in healthy normoglycemic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Whether this polymorphism is a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> can be estimated only in prospective population-based studies </plain></SENT>
