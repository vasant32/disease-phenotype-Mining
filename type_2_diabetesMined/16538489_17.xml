<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clot lysis rates were determined by confocal microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasmin generation was measured using a plasmin-specific chromogenic substrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surface plasmon resonance was used to determine the binding interactions between fibrin, tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and Glu-plasminogen; cross-linkage of plasmin inhibitor to fibrin by factor XIII was determined using a microtitre plate assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Lysis of diabetic clots was significantly slower than that of controls (1.35 vs 2.92 microm/min, p&lt;0.0001) and plasmin generation was significantly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The equilibrium binding affinity between both t-PA and Glu-plasminogen and fibrin was reduced in diabetic subjects: t-PA, K (D)=0.91+/-0.3 micromol/l (control subjects), 1.21+/-0.5 micromol/l (diabetic subjects), p=0.001; Glu-plasminogen, K (D)=97+/-19 nmol/l (control subjects), 156+/-66 nmol/l (diabetic subjects), p=0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cross-linkage of plasmin inhibitor to fibrin by factor XIII was enhanced in diabetic subjects, with the extent of in vitro cross-linkage correlating with in vivo glycaemic control (HbA(1c)) (r=0.59, p=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These results indicate that impairment of the fibrinolytic process in diabetic patients is mediated via a number of different mechanisms; these may be a consequence of post-translational modifications to fibrinogen molecules, resulting from their exposure to the abnormal metabolic milieu associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
