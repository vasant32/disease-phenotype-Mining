<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatment with insulin sensitisers may provoke <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo>, suggesting microvascular effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms underlying the peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> observed during <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> are unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore we examined the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> on microvascular variables involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Subjects (40-80 years) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and on insulin were randomised to 9 weeks of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> therapy (30 mg/day; n=14) or placebo (n=15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The following assessments were performed at baseline and 9 weeks: microvascular filtration capacity; isovolumetric venous pressure; capillary pressure; capillary recruitment following venous or <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp>; postural vasoconstriction; and maximum blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A number of haematological variables were also measured including vascular endothelium growth factor (VEGF), IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">Pioglitazone</z:chebi> did not significantly influence any microcirculatory variable as compared with placebo (analysis of covariance [ANCOVA] for microvascular filtration capacity for the two groups, p=0.26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean VEGF increased with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (61.1 pg/ml), but not significantly more than placebo (9.76 pg/ml, p=0.94) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>HbA(1c) levels and the inflammatory markers IL-6 and CRP decreased with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> compared with placebo (ANCOVA: p=0.009, p=0.001 and p=0.004, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">Pioglitazone</z:chebi> improved glycaemic control and inflammatory markers over 9 weeks but had no effect on microcirculatory variables associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in type 2 diabetic patients treated with insulin </plain></SENT>
