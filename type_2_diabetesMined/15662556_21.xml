<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between habitual coffee consumption and the incidence of IFG, IGT and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used cross-sectional and prospective data from the population-based Hoorn Study, which included Dutch men and women aged 50-74 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An OGTT was performed at baseline and after a mean follow-up period of 6.4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Associations were adjusted for potential confounders including BMI, cigarette smoking, physical activity, alcohol consumption and dietary factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, a 5 cup per day higher coffee consumption was significantly associated with lower fasting insulin concentrations (-5.6%, 95% CI -9.3 to -1.6%) and 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations (-8.8%, 95% CI -11.8 to -5.6%), but was not associated with lower fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations (-0.8%, 95% CI -2.1 to 0.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the prospective analyses, the odds ratio (OR) for IGT was 0.59 (95% CI 0.36-0.97) for 3-4 cups per day, 0.46 (95% CI 0.26-0.81) for 5-6 cups per day, and 0.37 (95% CI 0.16-0.84) for 7 or more cups per day, as compared with the corresponding values for the consumption of 2 or fewer cups of coffee per day (p=0.001 for trend) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Higher coffee consumption also tended to be associated with a lower incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (OR 0.69, CI 0.31-1.51 for &gt;/=7 vs &lt;/=2 cups per day, p=0.09 for trend), but was not associated with the incidence of IFG (OR 1.35, CI 0.80-2.27 for &gt;/=7 vs &lt;/=2 cups per day, p=0.49 for trend) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our findings indicate that habitual coffee consumption can reduce the risk of IGT, and affects post-load rather than fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
