<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined whether elevated WBC count, a marker of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, was associated with worsening of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance among Chinese population aged 40 years and over </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on the 75g OGTT, 1016 subjects aged from 40 to 88 years were classified into four groups: NFG/NGT (n=299), isolated IFG (n=213), IGT (n=213) and Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n=291) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared the WBC count among the four groups and investigated relevant variables associated significantly with the WBC count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The IGT and Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> groups had a significantly higher WBC count than the NFG/NGT and isolated IFG groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By stepwise regression analyses, we found that waist circumference, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi>, total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> and 2-h PG showed an independent association with the WBC count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the analysis stratified by sex and smoking status, WBC count was independently associated with age and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> in males, whereas it was associated with BMI, SBP, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> and 2-h PG in females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BMI, SBP, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> and 2-h PG showed an independent association with WBC count in subjects who never smoked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We concluded that an increase in WBC count was associated with the deterioration of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>WBC count was associated with <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism in males and with various components of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> in females and subjects who never smoked </plain></SENT>
