<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the characteristics and care of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in countries with a sizable Muslim population and to study <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> features during Ramadan and the effect of fasting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a population-based, retrospective, transversal survey conducted in 13 countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 12,914 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were recruited using a stratified sampling method, and 12,243 were considered for the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Investigators recruited 1,070 (8.7%) patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 11,173 (91.3%) patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During Ramadan, 42.8% of patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 78.7% with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> fasted for at least 15 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Less than 50% of the whole population changed their treatment dose (approximately one-fourth of patients treated with oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs [OADs] and one-third of patients using insulin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001988'>hypoglycemic episodes</z:hpo> were significantly more frequent during Ramadan compared with other months (type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 0.14 vs. 0.03 episode/month, P = 0.0174; type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 0.03 vs. 0.004 episode/month, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> was more frequent in subjects who changed their dose of OADs or insulin or modified their level of physical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The large proportion of both type 1 and type 2 diabetic subjects who fast during Ramadan represent a challenge to their physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There is a need to provide more intensive education before fasting, to disseminate guidelines, and to propose further studies assessing the impact of fasting on morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
