<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a population-based retrospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cox regression, stratified by pre- (&lt;55 years) and postmenopausal (â‰¥55 years) status, was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>, during earlier (0-3 months) and later (3 months to 10 years) time windows after <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> index date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with women without T2D, HRs for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> were 0.95 (95% CI 0.48-1.86; P = 0.88) and 1.31 (0.92-1.86; P = 0.14) in pre- and postmenopausal women with T2D, respectively, in the early time window, and 0.92 (0.75-1.13; P = 0.45) and 1.00 (0.90-1.11; P = 0.93) in pre- and postmenopausal women with T2D, respectively, in the later time window </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We observed a trend toward an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> in postmenopausal women with T2D, but only in the time period immediately after <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> index date </plain></SENT>
