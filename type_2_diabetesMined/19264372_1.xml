<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Hemodynamic data and arterial compliance were measured with a tonometer (<z:chebi fb="5" ids="53578">HDI</z:chebi>/Pulse wave CR-2000) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> patients with (n=32) and without (n=24) type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> before and after a 6-week multidisciplinary cardiac rehabilitation program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A decrease in heart rate and an increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume without significant change in resting cardiac output were obtained in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Arterial compliance of both small and large arteries was significantly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 10 diabetic patients, this increase could be related to an increase in the anti-hypertensive treatment and to the decreased blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the 22 remainders, the small artery compliance was significantly increased independently of blood pressure change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Exercise training as well as optimization of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> treatment could explain the improvement of arterial compliance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>If these changes are long-lasting and if they improve prognosis remains to be evaluated </plain></SENT>
