<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate the risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we measured insulin sensitivity and several risk factors in 94 Japanese type 2 diabetic patients with different types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> was classified by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) angiography into the following subtypes: 1) patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> MRI and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography (NOR; n = 30), 2) patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> (LAC; n = 28), 3) patients with atherothrombotic infarction (ATI; n = 22), and 4) patients with large-artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (LAA; n = 14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity was assessed by the K index of the insulin tolerance test (KITT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with LAC, ATI, and LAA were significantly older and were more likely to be hypertensive than patients with NOR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significantly higher <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> was observed in patients with LAC, ATI, and LAA than in patients with NOR (KITT 2.21 +/- 0.17, 2.10 +/- 0.17, 2.19 +/- 0.25, and 3.25 +/- 0.21% per min, respectively, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adjustment for age, sex, BMI, and duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> did not influence this result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistical regression analysis showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> was an independent risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The same analysis showed that a high pulse pressure was a risk factor for LAC, postprandial C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo>) was a risk factor for ATI, and longstanding <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> was a risk factor for LAA </plain></SENT>
