<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The calpain-10 gene (CAPN10) has been associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but information on molecular and physiological mechanisms explaining this association is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we addressed this question by studying the role of CAPN10 for phenotypes associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and free fatty acid (FFA) metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among 395 type 2 diabetic patients and 298 nondiabetic control subjects from Finland, the SNP-43 allele 1 (P = 0.011), SNP-63 allele 2 (P = 0.010), and the haplotype combination SNP-44/43/19/63 1121/1121 (P = 0.028) were associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The SNP-43 genotypes 11 and 12 were associated with higher fasting insulin and homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> index among control subjects (P = 0.021 and P = 0.0076) and with elevated FFA among both control subjects (P = 0.0040) and type 2 diabetic patients (P = 0.0025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multiple regression analysis further indicated that SNP-43 is an independent predictor of FFA levels (P = 0.0037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among 80 genotype discordant sibling pairs, the SNP-43 allele 1 was associated with elevated fasting serum insulin and HOMA index (P = 0.013 and P = 0.0068) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of the four SNPs showed distorted transmission of alleles to patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a qualitative transmission disequilibrium test, including 108 trios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because FFA and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> are known to predict type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the finding that variation in the CAPN10 gene influences FFA levels and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> may provide an explanation for how the CAPN10 gene increases susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
