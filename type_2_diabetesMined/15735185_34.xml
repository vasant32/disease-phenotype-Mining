<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group, 2-year study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Approximately 600 patients from 98 centers participated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eligible patients had completed a previous 12-month study and consented to continue treatment for a further year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To avoid selection bias, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> centers were included in the primary analysis (a comparison of the time-to-failure distributions of the two groups by using a log-rank test) regardless of whether they continued treatment for a 2nd year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By using repeated-measures ANOVA, time course of least square means of HbA(1c) and homeostasis model of assessment (HOMA) indexes (HOMA-%S and HOMA-%B) were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A greater proportion of patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> maintained HbA(1c) &lt;8% over the 2-year period than those treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A difference between the Kaplan-Meier curves was apparent as early as week 32 and widened at each time point thereafter, becoming statistically significant from week 52 onward </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At week 104, 129 (47.8%) of 270 pioglitazone-treated patients and 110 (37.0%) of 297 gliclazide-treated patients maintained HbA(1c) &lt;8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi> treatment, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> treatment produced a larger decrease in HbA(1c), a larger increase in HOMA-%S, and a smaller increase in HOMA-%B during the 2nd year of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">Pioglitazone</z:chebi> is superior to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi> in sustaining glycemic control in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during the 2nd year of treatment </plain></SENT>
