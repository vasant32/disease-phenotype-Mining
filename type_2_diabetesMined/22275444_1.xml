<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> is the first-line oral medication recommended for glycemic control in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reviewed the literature to quantify the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> treatment on glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA(1c)) levels in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and examine the impact of differing doses on glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched from 1950 to June 2010 for trials of at least 12 weeks' duration in which diabetic patients were treated with either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy or as an add-on therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data on change in HbA(1c) were pooled in a meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data from dose-comparison trials were separately pooled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 35 trials were identified for the main analysis and 7 for the dose-comparison analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy lowered HbA(1c) by 1.12% (95% CI 0.92-1.32; I(2) = 80%) versus placebo, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> added to oral therapy lowered HbA(1c) by 0.95% (0.77-1.13; I(2) = 77%) versus placebo added to oral therapy, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> added to insulin therapy lowered HbA(1c) by 0.60% (0.30-0.91; I(2) = 79.8%) versus insulin only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a significantly greater reduction in HbA(1c) using higher doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> compared with lower doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> with no significant increase in side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Evidence supports the effectiveness of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> therapy in a clinically important lowering of HbA(1c) used as monotherapy and in combination with other therapeutic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There is potential for using higher doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> to maximize glycemic control in diabetic patients without increasing gastrointestinal effects </plain></SENT>
