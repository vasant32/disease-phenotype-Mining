<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs on the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study with a newly diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> cohort of 25,690 patients registered in the U.K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>General Practice Research Database, 1988-1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We categorized person-time drug exposures to monotherapies in insulin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> (SUs), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformins</z:chebi>, and other oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi> (i.e., <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi>, guar gum) and combination therapy including insulin, combination therapy without insulin, and triple combination therapy with or without insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A drug-free time interval served as a reference category </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cox interval-wise (piece-wise) regression analyses were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The main outcome was incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 43,390 drug exposure intervals for 25,690 patients who had a mean follow-up period of 2.5 years, 1,409 patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>Heart failure</z:hpo> occurred most frequently in SU monotherapy exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the timing and order of treatments received, and known risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, we found no differential effects among type-specific therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with any drug use within the first year after <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosis had a 4.75-fold higher risk (hazard ratio) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> than those with drug-free status but had no increased risk during subsequent years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the use of any pharmacological therapy for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> appears to be associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This risk does not persist beyond the first year after diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and does not appear to differ among the types of drug therapy examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This observation suggests that the severity of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or the preclinical duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the need for drug therapy, and not the therapy itself, is an explanation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
