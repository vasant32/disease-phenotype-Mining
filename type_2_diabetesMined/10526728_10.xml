<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Women with uncomplicated type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have both a decreased maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) and slowed oxygen uptake (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="30047">VO2</z:chebi>) kinetics at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of exercise compared with nondiabetic women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These abnormalities are seen not only at maximal workloads, but also at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of low-level exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the hypothesis that VO2max and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30047">VO2</z:chebi> kinetics would improve with exercise training in untrained people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we measured these parameters in premenopausal sedentary women before and after 3 months of supervised exercise training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 8 women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 9 overweight nondiabetic women, and 10 lean nondiabetic women were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At baseline and after 3 months of exercise training, subjects underwent bicycle ergometer testing to obtain VO2max and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30047">VO2</z:chebi> kinetics data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On entry, women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had the lowest VO2max and slowest <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30047">VO2</z:chebi> kinetics of the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After exercise training, the women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> improved their VO2max more than the lean and overweight control women: 28 vs. 5 and 8%, respectively (P &lt; 0.05 for the diabetic group vs. both control groups) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the group with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30047">VO2</z:chebi> kinetics improved by 39 and 22% at 20 and 30 W, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For the control subjects, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30047">VO2</z:chebi> kinetics did not improve at any workload in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite beginning with the lowest VO2max and slowest <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30047">VO2</z:chebi> kinetics, subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> benefited more from an exercise training program than did control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that in addition to its known metabolic effects, exercise training in individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may be an effective therapy to improve the cardiovascular response to exercise and to overcome low-level exercise impairment as reflected by improved VO2max and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30047">VO2</z:chebi> kinetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>If the ability to make circulatory adjustments at the beginning of exercise at low workloads is improved by an exercise training program, as suggested by the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30047">VO2</z:chebi> kinetics data, the clinical significance of exercise for people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is clear </plain></SENT>
