<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether self-monitoring of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (SMBG) is associated with better glycemic control in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used cross-sectional and longitudinal data from type 2 diabetic participants in the observational, community-based Fremantle <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study (FDS) who reported SMBG status at study entry (n = 1,286) and annual reviews over 5 years (n = 531) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At study entry, 70% of patients performed SMBG, with a median of four tests per week (interquartile range two to seven) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with shorter <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration; who were attending <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> education, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related clinics, or medical specialists; who were taking insulin with or without oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi> (OHAs); and who were self-reporting hypoglycemic events were more likely to use SMBG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both cross-sectional and longitudinal FDS data showed that HbA(1c) (A1C) was not significantly different between SMBG users and nonusers, either overall or within <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treatment groups (diet, OHAs, and insulin with or without OHAs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was also no independent cross-sectional relationship between A1C and SMBG frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average annual societal cost of using SMBG (in year 2000 Australian dollars [Adollars], excluding glucometers) was 162 Australian dollars per type 2 diabetic patient or 51 million Australian dollars when projected to the Australian diagnosed type 2 diabetic population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Neither SMBG testing nor its frequency was associated with glycemic benefit in type 2 diabetic patients regardless of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data did not include methods of SMBG delivery and application, factors that require further assessment in the evaluation of SMBG utility in non-insulin-treated type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SMBG may be still of value in the identification and prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> and in dose adjustment in insulin-treated patients </plain></SENT>
