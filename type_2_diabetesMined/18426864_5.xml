<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Many prevalent diseases of advanced societies, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-induced type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, are linked to indolent mononuclear cell-dependent <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously proposed that blockade of alpha4 integrin signaling can inhibit <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> while limiting mechanism-based toxicities of loss of alpha4 function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, we hypothesized that mice bearing an alpha4(Y991A) mutation, which blocks signaling, would be protected from development of high-fat diet-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Six- to eight-week-old <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and alpha4(Y991A) C57Bl/6 male mice were placed on either a high-fat diet that derived 60% calories from <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> or a chow diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Metabolic testing was performed after 16-22 weeks of diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Alpha4(Y991A) mice were protected from development of high-fat diet-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This protection was conferred on <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice by alpha4(Y991A) bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the reverse experiment, <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> bone marrow renders high-fat diet-fed alpha4(Y991A) acceptor animals insulin resistant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, fat-fed alpha4(Y991A) mice showed a dramatic reduction of monocyte/macrophages in adipose tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This reduction was due to reduced monocyte/macrophage migration rather than reduced monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Alpha4 integrins contribute to the development of HFD-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> by mediating the trafficking of monocytes into adipose tissue; hence, blockade of alpha4 integrin signaling can prevent the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
