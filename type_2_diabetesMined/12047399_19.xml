<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multicentre study, 806 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (mean duration, 3 years) who had failed diet and exercise were randomly assigned to 4 weeks of therapy with placebo, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi> 2.5 mg, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> 500 mg, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> 1.25/250 mg, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> 2.5/500 mg once daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Doses were then titrated over 8 weeks based on glycaemic response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome measure was change from baseline in mean HbA1c after 20 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Changes in fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and body weight were also assessed along with 2-h postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin values after a standardized meal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At week 20, patients taking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> 1.25/250 mg or 2.5/500 mg tablets had greater reductions in HbA1c levels (-1.48% and -1.53% respectively) compared with placebo (-0.21%; both p &lt; 0.001), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi> (-1.24%; p = 0.016 and p = 0.004 respectively) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (-1.03%; both p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations were reduced more in both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> groups compared with placebo and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (p &lt; 0.001); patients in both combination therapy groups also had significantly lower postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations compared with placebo, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Initial combination treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> tablets produces greater improvements in glycaemic control than either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The superiority of initial therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> tablets may arise from simultaneous treatment of both pathophysiological defects of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
