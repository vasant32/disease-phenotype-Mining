<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although aggressive glycaemic control reduces microvascular complications, the evidence for macrovascular complications is less certain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The theoretical benefits of the mode of action of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> are clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In clinical practice, PPAR-α <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> such as fibrates improve <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidaemia</z:e>, while PPAR-γ <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> improve <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, although these agents are traditionally classed according to their target, they have different and sometimes conflicting clinical benefit and adverse event profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is speculated that this is because of differing properties and specificities for the PPAR receptors (each of which targets specific genes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is most obvious in the impact on cardiovascular outcomes--in clinical trials <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> appeared to reduce cardiovascular events, whereas <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> potentially increased the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The development of a dual PPAR-α/γ <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> may prove beneficial in effectively managing glycaemic control and improving <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidaemia</z:e> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Yet, development of agents such as muraglitazar and tesaglitazar has been hindered by various serious adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Aleglitazar, a balanced dual PPAR-α/γ <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, is currently the most advanced in clinical development and has shown promising results in phase II clinical trials with beneficial effects on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A phase III study, ALECARDIO, is ongoing and will establish whether improvements in laboratory test profiles translate into an improvement in cardiovascular outcomes </plain></SENT>
