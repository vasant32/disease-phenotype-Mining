<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine whether individual subjects with Type 1 (insulin-dependent) <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, who are treated with insulin, could be reliably distinguished, C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> concentrations and urinary C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> excretion were measured in 10 Caucasoids and 10 Pima Indians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the subjects had developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> before 21 years of age and were receiving insulin treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fasting C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> concentrations were significantly higher in the Pima Indians (0.73 +/- 0.17 versus 0.02 +/- 0.01 nmol/l in Caucasoids; p less than 0.001), but there were slight overlaps in individual values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Urinary C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> excretion, an index of 24-h-insulin excretion, was also higher in the Pima Indian group (27.6 +/- 1.85 versus 0.72 +/- 0.18 pmol/min in Caucasoids; p less than 0.001) and there was no overlap in the individual values between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Pima Indians with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have been previously shown to have Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and the Caucasoids with an early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> are most likely to have Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that distinction between these two major types of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> can be made effectively by using C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> measurements provided that overt <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal disease</z:e> is absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This differentiation between insulin-treated patients will be useful for a variety of research applications and possibly in making clinical management decisions </plain></SENT>
