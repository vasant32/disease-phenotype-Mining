<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated hepatic and peripheral insulin action including intracellular <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in 40 19-year-old men (20 LBW, 20 matched control subjects), using the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp technique at two physiological insulin levels (10 and 40 mU/m(2) per min), indirect calorimetry, and [3-(3)H]<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Insulin secretion was examined during an oral and intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fasting p-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was higher in the LBW group (5.6 +/- 0.1 vs. 5.4 +/- 0.1; P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Basal plasma <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> concentrations were significantly lower in the LBW group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Insulin-stimulated glycolytic flux was significantly reduced, and suppression of endogenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production was enhanced in the LBW group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, basal and insulin-stimulated rates of whole-body peripheral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> oxidation, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> oxidation, exogenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> storage, and nonoxidative <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism were similar in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Insulin secretion was reduced by 30% in the LBW group, when expressed relative to insulin sensitivity (disposition index = insulin secretion x insulin action) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We propose that reduced insulin-stimulated glycolysis precedes overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in LBW men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A lower insulin secretion may contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> and ultimately lead to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
