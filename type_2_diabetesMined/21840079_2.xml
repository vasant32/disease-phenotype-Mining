<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: 34 cases with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> were followed after fulfilling the inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The interventional group (n=12) had the same conventional approach of the control group but had two mobile numbers (physician and diabetic educator) provided for the SMS support until their next visit in 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both groups of age, BMI and the pre-study A1c were comparable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both groups had a significant reduction in their A1c compared to their baseline visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the interventional group had significantly greater reduction in A1c (p=0.001), 1.16% lower than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The service was highly satisfactory to the group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results indicate effectiveness in lowering A1c and acceptance by the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further research and large-scale studies are needed </plain></SENT>
