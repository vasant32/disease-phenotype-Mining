<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this interim 82-week analysis, 150 (total cohort) of an eligible population of 183 patients opted to continue exenatide treatment in an uncontrolled open-label extension of a 30-week double-blind, placebo-controlled trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these, 92 patients (completer cohort) achieved 82 weeks of exenatide therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients continued <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> throughout the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At the end of the placebo-controlled trial, exenatide resulted in an <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA1c) reduction from baseline of -1.0 +/- 0.1% (mean +/- SE) (exenatide treatment arms), with durable HbA1c reductions after 82 weeks of -1.3 +/- 0.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The percent of patients who achieved HbA1c &lt; or = 7% at weeks 30 and 82 was 46 and 59% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 30 weeks, exenatide caused a reduction in weight from baseline of -3.0 +/- 0.6 kg, with a progressive reduction in weight of -5.3 +/- 0.8 kg after 82 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, exenatide treatment produced clinically significant improvements in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> after 82 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most frequent adverse event after 30 and 82 weeks of exenatide was <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, which was generally of mild-or-moderate intensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It decreased in incidence after initiation in the controlled trial and the uncontrolled open-label extension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hypoglycaemia</z:e> was rare, with no severe events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Exenatide was generally well tolerated, producing a durable reduction in HbA1c and a progressive reduction in weight over 82 weeks in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> failing to achieve glycaemic control with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
