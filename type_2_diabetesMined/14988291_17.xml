<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study comprised 3,128 healthy Swedish men and 4,821 women, aged 35-56 years, living in the Stockholm area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test identified 55 men and 52 women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The relative contribution of established and psychosocial factors to socioeconomic differences in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk was assessed by comparing analyses with adjustment for different sets of these factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The relative risks (RRs) for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in middle and low socioeconomic groups in men were 2.4 (95% CI 1.0-5.3) and 2.9 (1.5-5.7), respectively, and in women 3.2 (1.5-6.6) and 2.7 (1.3-5.9), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In men, the RRs decreased to 1.9 (0.8-4.4) and 2.1 (1.0-4.2) after adjustment for established risk factors; no further change was found when psychosocial factors were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In women, the RRs changed to 2.4 (1.1-5.2) and 1.6 (0.7-3.8) by including established risk factors and to 2.3 (1.0-5.1) and 1.9 (0.8-4.3) by inclusion of psychosocial factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for both established and psychosocial factors, the RRs were 1.4 (0.6-3.6) and 1.0 (0.4-2.5), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In men, the excess risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was partly explained by established risk factors (36-42%), whereas psychosocial factors had no effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In women, most of the socioeconomic differences in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were explained by simultaneous adjustment for established risk factors and psychosocial factors (81-100%) </plain></SENT>
