<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The use of C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> as the denominator in the ratio may allow for better prediction because C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> concentration is not affected by hepatic insulin clearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this paper was to compare fasting intact and split proinsulin-to-insulin ratios (PI/I, SPI/I) with intact and split proinsulin-to-C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> ratios (PI/C-pep, SPI/C-pep) in the prediction of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Prospective data on 818 multi-ethnic adults without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at baseline from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin Resistance</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Study (IRAS) were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity (S(I)) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin response (AIR) were determined from frequently sampled intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests, and fasting intact and split proinsulin were measured using specific two-site monoclonal antibody-based immunoradiometric assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Associations of proinsulin ratios with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were determined using logistic regression and differences in prediction were assessed by comparing areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AROCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In logistic regression analyses, PI/C-pep and SPI/C-pep were more strongly associated with incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 128) than PI/I and SPI/I, and were significantly better predictors of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in AROC analyses (PI/C-pep = 0.662 vs PI/I = 0.603, p = 0.02; SPI/C-pep = 0.690 vs SPI/I = 0.631, p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both PI/C-pep and SPI/C-pep were associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, waist circumference, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and S(I) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both PI/C-pep and SPI/C-pep were significantly associated with incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in models that included AIR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Proinsulin-to-C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> ratios were stronger predictors of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in comparison with proinsulin-to-insulin ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings support the use of C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> as the denominator for proinsulin ratios, to more accurately reflect the degree of disproportional hyperproinsulinaemia </plain></SENT>
