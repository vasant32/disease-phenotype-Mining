<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The feasibility study for the VA Cooperative Study on Glycemic Control and Complications in Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> (VA CSDM) prospectively studied 153 insulin-requiring type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients, randomized between an intensively treated arm and a standard treatment arm during a mean follow-up of 27 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The glycemic response to each of the progressive, sequential phases of insulin treatment was assessed, along with the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271710" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycemic reactions</z:e> and the relative efficacy of different doses of glipizide in combination with fixed doses of insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Five medical centers participated; half of the patients were assigned to the intensive treatment arm aiming for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> HbA1c levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Age of patients was 60 +/- 6 years, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> 8 +/- 3 years, and BMI 30.7 +/- 4 kg/m2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A four-step management technique was used, with patients moving to the next step if the operational goals were not met: Phase I, evening intermediate or long-acting insulin; phase II, added day-time glipizide; phase III, two injections of insulin alone; and phase IV, multiple daily insulin injections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Home <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring measurements were done twice daily and at 3:00 A.M. once a week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271710" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hypoglycemic reactions</z:e> and home <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring results were recorded and counted in each of the treatment phases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Baseline HbA1c was 9.3 +/- 1.8%, and fasting plus serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was 11.4 +/- 3.3 mmol/1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fasting serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> fell to near <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in phase I, and remained so in the other treatment phases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An HbA1c separation of 2.1% between the arms was maintained during the course of the study, while the intensive arm kept HbA1c levels below 7.3% (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Most of the decrease in HbA1c occurred with one injection of insulin alone (phase I, -1.4%) or adding day-time glipizide (phase II, -1.9% compared with baseline) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>HbA1c did not decrease further after substituting two injections of insulin alone, with twice the insulin dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Multiple daily injections resulted in an additional HbA1c fall (-2.4% compared with baseline) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, two-thirds of the patients were still on one or two injections a day at the end of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Changes in home <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring levels paralleled those of the HbA1c, as did the increments in number of reported <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271710" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycemic reactions</z:e>, virtually <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> either "mild" or "moderate" in character </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>For the combination of glipizide and insulin (phase II), the only significant effect was obtained with daily doses up to 10 mg a day; there were no significant additional benefits with up to fourfold higher daily doses, and HbA1c levels had an upward trend with doses &gt; 20 mg/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A simple regime of a single injection of insulin, alone or with glipizide, seemed sufficient to obtain clinically acceptable levels of HbA1c for most <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, insulin-requiring type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Further decrease of HbA1c demanded multiple daily injections at the expense of doubling the insulin dose and the rate of hypoglycemic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In combination therapy, doses of glipizide &gt; 20 mg/day offered no additional benefit </plain></SENT>
