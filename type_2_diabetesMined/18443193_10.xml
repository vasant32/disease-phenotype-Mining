<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the association between major dietary patterns and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance status as measured by A1C in Japanese adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The groups of subjects were comprised of 3,243 men and 4,667 women who participated in the baseline survey of an ongoing cohort study on lifestyle-related diseases in Fukuoka, Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dietary patterns were derived by using principal-component analysis of the consumption of 49 food items, ascertained by a food-frequency questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate sex-specific odds ratios (ORs) of elevated A1C (&gt;or=5.5%), with adjustment for potential confounding variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The Westernized breakfast pattern characterized by frequent intake of bread but infrequent intake of rice was inversely related to A1C concentrations (P(trend) = 0.02 in both men and women); the multivariate-adjusted ORs for the highest versus lowest quintiles were 0.60 (95% CI 0.43-0.84) and 0.64 (0.46-0.90) for men and women, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The seafood dietary pattern was positively associated with A1C concentrations in men only (P(trend) = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neither the healthy nor high-fat dietary pattern was related to A1C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A dietary pattern featuring frequent intake of white rice may deteriorate <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in Japanese men and women, and the salty seafood dietary pattern may have a similar effect in men </plain></SENT>
