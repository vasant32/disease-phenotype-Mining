<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We determined the effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi>) metabolism using <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> diabetic fatty rats (ZDF/Gmi fa/fa and ZDF/Gmi fa/?) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasma total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> was reduced in ZDF fa/fa rats by 24% in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pre-diabetic</z:e> insulin-resistant stage, while in the frank diabetic stage there was a 59% reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hepatic activities of several enzymes that play a role in the removal of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi>:<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17755">cystathionine</z:chebi> beta-synthase (CBS), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17755">cystathionine</z:chebi> gamma-lyase, and betaine:<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> methyltransferase (BHMT) were increased as was methionine adenosyltransferase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CBS and BHMT <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels and the hepatic level of S-adenosylmethionine were also increased in the ZDF fa/fa rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Studies with primary hepatocytes showed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> export and the transsulfuration flux in cells from ZDF fa/fa rats were particularly sensitive to betaine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, liver betaine concentration was found to be significantly lower in the ZDf fa/fa rats at both 5 and 11 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results emphasize the importance of betaine metabolism in determining plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> levels in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
