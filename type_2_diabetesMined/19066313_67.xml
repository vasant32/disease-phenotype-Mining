<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, although the mechanisms linking these pathologies remain undetermined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519106" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">rodent models</z:e> revealed endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in adipose and liver tissues and demonstrated that ER stress could cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we tested whether these stress pathways were also present in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> human subjects and/or regulated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Eleven <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> men and women (BMI 51.3 +/- 3.0 kg/m2) were studied before and 1 year after gastric bypass (GBP) surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We examined systemic insulin sensitivity using hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies before and after surgery and collected subcutaneous adipose and liver tissues to examine ER stress markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Subjects lost 39 +/- 9% body wt at 1 year after GBP surgery (P &lt; 0.001), which was associated with a marked improvement in hepatic, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Markers of ER stress in adipose tissue significantly decreased with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Specifically, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-regulated protein 78 (Grp78) and spliced X-box binding protein-1 (sXBP-1) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were reduced, as were phosphorylated elongation initiation factor 2alpha (eIF2alpha) and stress kinase c-Jun <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29318,29339">NH2</z:chebi>-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P values &lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Liver sections from a subset of subjects showed intense staining for Grp78 and phosphorylated eIF2alpha before surgery, which was reduced in post-GBP sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study presents important evidence that ER stress pathways are present in selected tissues of <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> humans and that these signals are regulated by marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and metabolic improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Hence, this suggests the possibility of a relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-related ER stress and metabolic dysfunction in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> humans </plain></SENT>
