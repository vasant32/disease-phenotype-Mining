<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was undertaken to examine the efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="601027">aliskiren</z:chebi>, a direct renin inhibitor, on cardiovascular injuries, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> and pancreatic injury in a mouse model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Groups of db/db mice, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="601027">aliskiren</z:chebi> (3, 6, 12 and 25 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) or hydralazine (80 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) for 6 weeks, and the protective effects were extensively compared among groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> sub-pressor and hypotensive doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="601027">aliskiren</z:chebi> significantly attenuated <z:mp ids='MP_0003141'>cardiac fibrosis</z:mp>, macrophage infiltration and coronary remodelling, and improved vascular endothelial function in db/db mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These protective effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="601027">aliskiren</z:chebi> were attributed to the attenuation of cardiac p22(phox)-related <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase-induced <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> and the restoration of vascular endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (eNOS) production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="601027">Aliskiren</z:chebi> at the highest dose (25 mg kg(-1) day(-1)), but not at lower doses, partially reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> in db/db mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the highest dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="601027">aliskiren</z:chebi> significantly attenuated the decreases in pancreatic islet insulin content and beta cell mass, and prevented pancreatic islet <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> in db/db mice, being associated with the reduction of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine-positive cells and Nox2 (also known as Cybb) expression in pancreatic islets by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="601027">aliskiren</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our work provides the first evidence that direct renin inhibition with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="601027">aliskiren</z:chebi> protects against cardiovascular complications and pancreatic injury, through the attenuation of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, we propose that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="601027">aliskiren</z:chebi> may be a promising therapeutic agent for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
