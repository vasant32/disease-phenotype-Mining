<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, CAD-related mortality in Japanese type 2 diabetics is lower than in Caucasians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> is related to CAD in Japanese type 2 diabetics, we measured insulin sensitivity and several coronary risk factors in Japanese patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with and without CAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three patients with definite CAD and 33 age- and sex-matched patients without CAD (control) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity was assessed by the K index of insulin tolerance test (KITT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical characteristics, classical risk factors, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> (a), and insulin sensitivity were compared between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with CAD had a significantly longer duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (9.0 +/- 1.4 vs. 5.5 +/- 0.9 years, P &lt; 0.05, respectively), were mostly hypertensive (69.7 vs. 39.4%, P &lt; 0.05), and more likely to be treated with insulin (45.5 vs. 18.2%, P &lt; 0.05) compared with the control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Concerning the metabolic parameters, patients with CAD had a significantly higher <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> than control (2.40 +/- 0.15 vs. 3.23 +/- 0.17%/min, P &lt; 0.01, respectively), higher <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> (1.39 +/- 0.10 vs. 1.05 +/- 0.05 mmol/l, P &lt; 0.05), lower <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (1.05 +/- 0.05 vs. 1.28 +/- 0.06 mmol/l, P &lt; 0.05), and higher <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> (a) (27.5 +/- 4.3 vs. 17.4 +/- 2.0 mg/dl, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, high <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> (a) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003233'>low HDL cholesterol</z:hpo> were independently related to CAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> per se is a significant risk factor for CAD in Japanese patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
