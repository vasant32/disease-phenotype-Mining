<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Incident cases of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were identified during 8 years of follow-up in a prospective cohort study of 91246 U.S. women aged 26 to 46 years and being free of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and other major <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> diseases at baseline in 1991 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 741 incident cases of confirmed Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during 716276 person-years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The relative risk adjusted for potential non-dietary confounders was 1.91 (95% CI: 1.42-2.57) in women consuming processed meat five times or more a week compared with those consuming processed meat less than once a week ( p&lt;0.001 for trend) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further adjustment for intakes of <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi>, cereal fibre, glycaemic index, and <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi> or for a Western dietary pattern did not appreciably change the results and associations remained strong after further adjustment for fatty acid and cholesterol intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Frequent consumption of bacon, hot dogs, and sausage was each associated with an increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While total red meat (beef or lamb as main dish, pork as main dish, hamburger, beef, pork or lamb as sandwich or mixed dish) intake was associated with an increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, this association was attenuated after adjustment for <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi>, cereal fiber, glycaemic index, and <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi> (relative risk: 1.44; 95% CI: 0.92-2.24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: Our data suggest that diets high in processed meats could increase the risk for developing Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
