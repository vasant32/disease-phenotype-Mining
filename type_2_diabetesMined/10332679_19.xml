<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied a biethnic cohort of 12,330 men and women, 45-64 years of age, of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Risk in Communities Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>New cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were diagnosed by a reported physician diagnosis, hypoglycemic medication use, or a casual or fasting serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level of &gt; or = 11.1 or &gt; or = 7 mmol/l, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over an average follow-up of 7 years, 1,335 new cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The odds ratios (4th versus 1st quartile) of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, adjusted by logistic regression for age, sex, race, study center, family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, physical activity, and smoking, were 1.2 (95% CI 1.0-1.5) for fibrinogen and 1.4 (1.1-1.6) for factor VII </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Associations for factor VIII, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor, and activated partial thromboplastin time were found to be 1.8 (1.3-2.3), 1.4 (1.1-1.8), and 0.63 (0.49-0.82), respectively, in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although further adjustment for BMI and waist-to-hip ratio diminished the relationships, a highly statistically significant association (P = 0.001) remained for factor VIII (1.6 [1.2-2.1]) in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Factor VIII and other hemostasis variables are associated with the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in middle-aged adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings support a role for <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and, particularly in women, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> in the pathogenesis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
