<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the efficacy and safety of miglitol vs. placebo in type 2 diabetic outpatients insufficiently controlled (HbA1c between 7.5 and 10.5%) with diet and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients treated with diet and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (1500-2250 mg/day) were randomized to receive additional treatment with either miglitol or placebo for 32 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The dosages were force-titrated: 4 weeks at 25 mg miglitol t.i.d., 12 weeks at 50 mg miglitol t.i.d., and 16 weeks at 100 mg miglitol t.i.d. or matching placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>If the highest dosage could not be tolerated, patients could be down-titrated to 50 mg t.i.d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary efficacy criterion was the change in glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Secondary efficacy parameters included fasting and 1 h postprandial blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, serum insulin, and fasting and 1 h postprandial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Safety and tolerability were evaluated by the incidence of adverse events and changes in vital signs or routine biochemical and haematological parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-two patients were valid for the intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a significant decrease in HbA1c on adding miglitol to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> compared to adding placebo (miglitol treatment effect, - 0.21%; placebo treatment effect, + 0.22%; p = 0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postprandial blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> declined in both the miglitol/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and placebo/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> groups with a statistically significant difference in favour of miglitol/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (end of treatment adjusted means 13.8 mmol/l for miglitol vs. 15.8 mmol/l for placebo, p = 0.0007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Adverse events (AEs) were reported by only 8% more patients in the miglitol/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> group than placebo/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Miglitol can safely and effectively be added to diet and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> in patients whose type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is insufficiently controlled, and improves glycaemic control by significantly reducing HbA1c and postprandial blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
