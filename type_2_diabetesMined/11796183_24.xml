<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Five hundred and twenty five study-eligible Ojibwa-Cree individuals age 18 and over in the community of Sandy Lake, Canada who had participated in a population-based survey were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> status, plasma concentrations of total cholesterol (TC), <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (TG), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>), calculated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low density lipoprotein-cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>), waist/hip ratio (WHR), BMI, systolic and diastolic BP, and history of smoking were compared to a standard national population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Extremely high rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (BMI and WHR) were identified in the study population and were associated with increasing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> for both males and females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rates of smoking exceeded 70 and 80% in females and males, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, despite <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> individuals who had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance had significantly lower rates of high risk TC, TG, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> levels compared to a national Canadian population survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, with worsening <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo>, TC, TG, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> dramatically deteriorated in comparison to nationally published levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These changes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, as a consequence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, appear to result in increased clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although this and similar populations have historically reported low rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>, the impact of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> risk factor is having devastating consequences on cardiovascular outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This trend is expected to continue unless the high rates of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> can be modified </plain></SENT>
