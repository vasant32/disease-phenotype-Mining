<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether this downregulation is a cause or effect of early aberrations in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, such as disturbances in fat metabolism, is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined whether <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> was associated with downregulation of expression of skeletal muscle genes involved in oxidative metabolism and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> biogenesis in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nine healthy lean male subjects underwent a 6-h hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp with simultaneous infusion of either a <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> emulsion or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> as a control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood was sampled at regular time points and muscle biopsies were taken before and after every test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intramuscular triacylglycerol (IMTG) content was determined by Oil Red O staining and gene expression was measured by quantitative PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">Lipid</z:chebi> infusion resulted in a approximately 2.7-fold increase in plasma NEFA levels and a 31+/-6% decrease in insulin sensitivity (p=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The infusion of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> resulted in a approximately 1.6-fold increase in IMTG (p=0.02), whereas during the clamp with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> infusion IMTG tended to decrease to approximately 53% of preinfusion levels (p=0.065) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">Lipid</z:chebi> infusion decreased PPARGC1A, PPARGC1B and PPARA expression to approximately 61, 77 and approximately 52% of basal values respectively, whereas expression of uncoupling protein 3 was upregulated 1.8-fold (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> elevation of plasma NEFA levels, leading to muscular fat accumulation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, downregulates PPARGC1A, PPARGC1B and PPARA expression, suggesting that the decrease in PPARGC1 expression observed in the (pre)diabetic state may be the result, rather than the cause of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
