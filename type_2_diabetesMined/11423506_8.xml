<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A single dose of nateglinide (60, 120, or 180 mg) or placebo was given to eight diet-treated overnight-fasted type 2 diabetic patients and to seven patients 5 min before a standard breakfast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, radioimmunoassay insulin, and nateglinide were measured at baseline and for a further 180 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The time-averaged 180-min postdose mean decrease in fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration was greater after nateglinide (1.8 mmol/l; 95% CI 1.5-2.0) than after placebo (0.7 mmol/l; 95% CI 0.3-1.2) (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>Hypoglycemia</z:hpo> did not develop in any of the subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Insulin concentrations increased 1.5-, 1.8-, and 1.9-fold with the 60-, 120-, and 180-mg doses, respectively (P &lt; 0.001), peaking approximately 30 min after the dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nateglinide concentrations peaked after approximately 30 min, decreasing to 21% of peak by 180 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the meal test, the mean increase (2.9 mmol/l, 2.3-3.6) in plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> over 180 min after placebo was reduced by 1.8 mmol/l (P &lt; 0.001) with the two higher doses of nateglinide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A single dose of nateglinide administered to diet-treated type 2 diabetic patients with fasting <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0003058'>increased insulin secretion</z:mp> and reduced fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Administered 5 min before a meal, nateglinide reduced the postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excursion by 64% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>With its rapid <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and short duration of action, nateglinide is a promising oral prandial therapy in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
