<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of them were being treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> and had poor glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were given 7.5 mg/day of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> and were followed for 12 weeks at monthly intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 30 patients, HbA1c was significantly decreased after 12 weeks of treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (8.2+/-0.7% vs. 7.4+/-0.8%, P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum HMW adiponectin increased markedly from 5.2 (2.4, 8.6) microg/ml at baseline to 9.8 (4.1, 12.6) microg/ml at the end of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> treatment (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When the changes were evaluated separately for each sex, diabetic men showed no increase of body weight or BMI after treatment, while HbA1c decreased significantly, and did Hct </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum HMW adiponectin increased significantly after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In diabetic women, neither body weight nor BMI increased after treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>, as was the case for the men </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Serum HMW adiponectin increased significantly after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> therapy could significantly improved glycemic control and markedly increased serum HMW adiponectin in both male and female Japanese patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
