<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although studies on UCP3 knock-out mice suggest that lack of UCP3 function does not cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> or Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, it is possible that up-regulation of UCP3 function improves these disorders or their clinical sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 10- to 20-fold increase of UCP3 gene expression is achievable through physiological or pharmacological stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined the phenotype of transgenic mice with approximately 18-fold overexpression of mouse UCP3 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We generated transgenic mice with approximately 18-fold overexpression of mouse UCP3 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in skeletal muscle under control of the skeletal muscle-specific muscle <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase gene promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The phenotype of these mice was analysed either on a standard diet or on a 4-week high-fat diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In mice on standard chow, there was no difference in body weight, oxygen consumption and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> protonmotive force between transgenic mice and non-transgenic littermates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, transgenic mice tended to have lower body weight, <z:mp ids='MP_0005289'>increased oxygen consumption</z:mp> and decreased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> protonmotive force than the control mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Transgenic mice on a 4-week high-fat diet consumed much more oxygen and had noticeably less <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> and less epididymal fat, as well as better <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance than non-transgenic littermates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our study shows that 18-fold overexpression of UCP3 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the skeletal muscle reduced diet-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An 18-fold increase of UCP3 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> can be attained by physiological or pharmacological stimuli, suggesting that UCP3 has therapeutic potential in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
