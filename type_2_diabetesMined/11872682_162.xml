<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the effect of three months of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> treatment (4 mg b.i.d.) on whole-body insulin sensitivity and in vivo peripheral adipocyte insulin sensitivity as assessed by <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> release in microdialysis from subcutaneous fat during a two-step (20 and 120 mU.m(-2).min(-1)) hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp in nine type 2 diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> on liver and muscle <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> content were assessed by (1)H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">Rosiglitazone</z:chebi> treatment resulted in a 68% (P &lt; 0.002) and a 20% (P &lt; 0.016) improvement in insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism during the low- and high- dosage-insulin clamps, respectively, which was associated with approximately 40% reductions in plasma fatty acid concentration (P &lt; 0.05) and hepatic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> content (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These changes were associated with a 39% increase in extramyocellular <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> content (P &lt; 0.05) and a 52% increase in the sensitivity of peripheral adipocytes to the inhibitory effects of insulin on lipolysis (P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, these results support the hypothesis that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> enhance insulin sensitivity in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by promoting <z:mp ids='MP_0002891'>increased insulin sensitivity</z:mp> in peripheral adipocytes, which results in lower plasma fatty acid concentrations and a redistribution of intracellular <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> from insulin responsive organs into peripheral adipocytes </plain></SENT>
