<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Selected candidate genes have been analyzed in the Pima Indians of Arizona based on evidence that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have significant genetic determinants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An amino acid substitution at codon 905 of the <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi>-targeting subunit of type 1 protein phosphatase that regulates skeletal muscle glycogenesis was recently reported to be associated with changes in insulin action in Danish subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition to the variant at 905, we report here a novel substitution at codon 883 and common variant of an "ATTTA" element in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of the corresponding gene (PPP1R3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 3'-UTR variant resembled the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>-destabilizing AT(AU)-rich elements (AREs) and resulted in a 10-fold difference in reporter <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> half-life, was correlated with PPP1R3 transcript and protein concentrations in vivo, and was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the Pimas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The variant is more common in Pimas (0.56) than in Caucasians (0.40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because of its apparent effect on expression of PPP1R3, it may, in part, contribute to the higher prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in this Native American population </plain></SENT>
