<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four-year results of main metabolic parameters are presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: VADT is a 7.5 years prospective randomized study of 1791 patients, 20 centres, of men and women of age 60.5 +/- 8.7 years, diagnosed for 11.5 +/- 7.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their body mass index (BMI) at baseline was 31 +/- 4 kg/m(2) and mean A1C 9.4 +/- 1.5% after maximum dose of oral agents or insulin treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Step treatment consists of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>, insulin and other agents; A1C goals are 8-9% in STD and &lt;6% in INT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lifestyle, blood pressure and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> are treated uniformly in both arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A1C improved in both arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>INT kept median A1C &lt;7% <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> years, A1C separation is 1.5-1.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>From year 1 to 4, mean blood pressure is &lt;129/74 mmHg, similar throughout </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> was &lt;97 mg/dl by year 1 and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> 150 or less by 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">Triglycerides</z:chebi> were lower in INT (12-16 mg/dl; p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>By 4 years, 88% are on <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering agents and 93% are on antiplatelet/<z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>BMI is higher in INT every year (0.9-1.6 kg/m(2); p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: VADT is maintaining the expected A1C in both STD and INT, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> and blood pressure are at target </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The trial is continuing to June 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>It will be the first long-term completed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> study of the role of glycaemia on CV disease with modern treatments </plain></SENT>
