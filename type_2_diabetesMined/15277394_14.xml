<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the platelet collagen receptor <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> VI (GPVI) was studied in 385 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Surface expression of the platelet Fc receptor that forms a functional complex with GPVI was significantly increased in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with those without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fc receptor expression correlated with GPVI expression and was found to be independently associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (r = 0.529, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Stimulation of GPVI through a specific anti-GPVI monoclonal antibody significantly enhanced surface expression of CD40L (P = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because CD40L is a potent platelet-derived cytokine that is involved in <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, we evaluated the effect of GPVI-mediated release of CD40L on activation of endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Coincubation of GPVI-stimulated platelets resulted in substantial enhanced endothelial surface expression of CD62P, alphavbeta3, and intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule 1 (P &lt; 0.05) and secretion of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 of cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the function of collagen receptor GPVI is altered in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and may play an important role in atherothrombotic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of GPVI may be a promising pharmacological target in the treatment of high-risk diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
