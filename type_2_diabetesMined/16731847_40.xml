<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Older adults with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have a two- to threefold increased risk of physical disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, muscle strength has never been investigated with regard to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a population-based study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated grip and knee extensor strength and muscle mass in 485 older adults with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 2,133 without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the Health, Aging, and Body Composition study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Older adults with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had greater arm and leg muscle mass than those without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> because they were bigger in body size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite this, muscle strength was lower in men with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and not higher in women with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than corresponding counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Muscle quality, defined as muscle strength per unit regional muscle mass, was significantly lower in men and women with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than those without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in both upper and lower extremities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, longer duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (&gt;or=6 years) and poor glycemic control (HbA(1c) &gt;8.0%) were associated with even poorer muscle quality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is associated with lower skeletal muscle strength and quality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These characteristics may contribute to the development of physical disability in older adults with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
