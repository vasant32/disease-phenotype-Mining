<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> is widely used in the management of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, its mechanism(s) of action is not fully known, and there have been remarkably few reports on short-term effects of the drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we examined early effects on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism, and on certain adipose tissue and inflammatory markers during treatment for 28 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-one patients were randomized to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (n = 16) or placebo (n = 5) and studied at baseline, 1, 2 and 4 weeks with blood sampling and oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests (OGTT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The active group received 500 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> daily in week 1, 500 mg twice daily in week 2 and 1000 mg twice daily in week 3 and 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 7 days of treatment, a reduced area under curve (AUC) for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> at OGTT with no change in AUC for insulin levels was observed compared with baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity, as derived from the OGTT by Gutt's index, was increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reductions in fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, total and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> appeared after 14 days, and reductions in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and leptin after 28 days of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no changes in body weight, adiponectin or C-reactive protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with placebo, the changes between day 0 and day 28 differed significantly with regard to AUC for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> at OGTT and Gutt's index, and showed strong trends for PAI-1 and leptin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The data demonstrate that in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> rapidly affects <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> handling without changing the concentrations of insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Reductions in PAI-1 and leptin levels indicate that the early effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> involve also the adipose tissue </plain></SENT>
