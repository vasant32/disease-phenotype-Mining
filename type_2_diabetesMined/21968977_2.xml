<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the processes driving this particular ATM phenotype are not understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genome-wide association studies associated the CDKN2A locus, encoding the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> suppressor p16(INK4A), with the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, p16(INK4A) levels in human ATMs and the role of p16(INK4A) in acquiring the ATM phenotype were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Gene expression of p16 ( INK4A ) in ATMs was analysed and compared with that in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) from <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients or with macrophages from human atherosclerotic plaques (AMs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, p16(INK4A) levels were studied during macrophage differentiation and polarisation of monocytes isolated from healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The role of p16(INK4A) in MDMs from healthy donors was investigated by small interfering (si)<z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-mediated silencing or adenovirus-mediated overproduction of p16(INK4A) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with MDMs and AMs, ATMs from <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients expressed lower levels of p16 ( INK4A ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In vitro, IL-4-induced M2 polarisation resulted in lower p16(INK4A) protein levels after differentiation of monocytes from healthy donors in macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Silencing of p16(INK4A) in MDMs mediated by siRNA increased the expression of M2 marker genes and enhanced the response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS), to give a phenotype resembling that of ATM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>By contrast, adenovirus-mediated overproduction of p16(INK4A) in MDMs diminished M2 marker gene expression and the response to LPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis revealed that p16(INK4A) overproduction inhibits LPS- and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi>-induced Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-nuclear factor of κ light <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> gene enhancer in B cells (NF-κB) signalling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These results show that p16(INK4A) inhibits the acquisition of the ATM phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The age-related increase in p16(INK4A) level may thus influence <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ATM function and contribute to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
