<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Finnish DPS (<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Prevention Study) demonstrated that lifestyle intervention, aimed at increasing physical activity, improving diet, and decreasing body weight, reduced the incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in individuals with overweight and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> by 58% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we studied which immunological markers at baseline predicted subsequent type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and whether there are immunologically defined subsets of subjects who are more or less responsive to the protective effects of lifestyle intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We randomly assigned 522 participants to a control group (n = 257) or a lifestyle intervention group (n = 265) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunological parameters at baseline included high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid A, interleukin-6, regulated on activation <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), and soluble intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the control group, CRP was the best immunological predictor for progression to overt type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the intervention group, progression to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was significantly higher in subjects with the highest RANTES concentrations and was lower in subjects with the highest MIF levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ratios of RANTES to MIF in the upper tertile were highly predictive of incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the intervention group (P = 0.006), whereas the association was less pronounced in the control group (P = 0.088) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, systemic concentrations of immune mediators appear to be associated with the progression to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the prevention of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by lifestyle changes </plain></SENT>
