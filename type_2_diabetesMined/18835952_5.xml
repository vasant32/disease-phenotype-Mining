<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (A-FABP) is a major cytoplasmic protein in adipocytes and macrophages and is closely associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e>, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigated whether A-FABP was associated with nonalcoholic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>fatty liver</z:hpo> disease (NAFLD) in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We enrolled 181 type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical and biochemical metabolic parameters were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The severity of NAFLD was measured by ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A-FABP, adiponectin, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50211">retinol</z:chebi>-binding protein-4 (RBP-4) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A-FABP levels, defined as more than a moderate degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>fatty liver</z:hpo> compared with men, those without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e>, and those without NAFLD, were higher in women, patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e>, and patients with overt NAFLD, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adiponectin was decreased according to the severity of NAFLD, but RBP-4 showed no difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Age- and sex-adjusted A-FABP showed positive correlations with BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, waist circumference, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, gamma-glutamyltransferase, fasting insulin, homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-IR), A1C, and C-reactive protein (CRP) but showed negative correlation with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio (OR) for the risk of overt NAFLD with increasing levels of sex-specific A-FABP was significantly increased (OR 2.90 [95% CI 1.15-7.29] vs. 7.87 [3.20-19.38]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The OR in the highest tertile of A-FABP remained significant after adjustments for BMI, waist circumference, A1C, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, HOMA-IR, CRP, and hepatic enzymes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that serum A-FABP is significantly associated with NAFLD in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, independent of BMI, waist circumference, HOMA-IR, A1C, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, and CRP </plain></SENT>
