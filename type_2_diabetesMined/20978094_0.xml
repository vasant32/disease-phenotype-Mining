<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We determined incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or macrovascular complications by sex among major Asian subgroups, South Asian and Chinese, and white patients with newly diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using population-based administrative data from British Columbia and Alberta, Canada (1997-1998 to 2006-2007), we identified patients with newly diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> aged â‰¥35 years and followed them for up to 10 years for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, or hospitalization for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ethnicity was determined using validated surname algorithms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 15,066 South Asian, 17,754 Chinese, and 244,017 white patients with newly diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Chinese women and men had the lowest incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> relative to that of white or South Asian patients, who had the highest incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mortality in those with newly diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was lower in South Asian (hazard ratio 0.69 [95% CI 0.62-0.76], P &lt; 0.001) and Chinese patients (0.69 [0.63-0.74], P &lt; 0.001) then in white patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> was similar or lower in the ethnic groups relative to that of white patients and varied by sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> varies significantly among ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mortality was substantially lower in South Asian and Chinese patients with newly diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than in white patients </plain></SENT>
