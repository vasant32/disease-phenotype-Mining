<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-three pregnancies in type-1 diabetics (PDM1, age 28.3+/-1.1 years) and 51 pregnancies in type-2 diabetics (PDM2, age 32.8+/-0.6 years) were followed and treated with intensified insulin therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several factors potentially influencing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001520'>macrosomia</z:hpo> were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Statistics: chi-square, Fisher's exact, Student's "t" and Mann-Whitney "U" tests, and ROC analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In PDM1 and PDM2, respectively, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001520'>large-for-gestational-age</z:hpo> (LGA) frequencies were 26.08% and 37.25% (NS), antepartum HbA1c values were 6.5+/-0.32 and 6.1+/-0.16 (NS), and pre-pregnancy body mass indexes (BMI) were 23.03+/-0.66 and 30.01+/-0.89 (p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In PDM1 the main predictor of LGA was an antepartum HbA1c&gt; or =6.8% (p=0.046), whereas in PDM2 pregestational BMI&gt; or =24 the variable associated (p=0.032) with LGA newborns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PDM1 and PDM2 differ in the underlying factors related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001520'>macrosomia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Whereas in PDM1 the antepartum HbA1c emerged as the most significant variable, suggesting that glycemic control largely determines <z:hpo ids='HP_0001520'>macrosomia</z:hpo>, in PDM2 with near-optimal glycemic control, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001520'>macrosomia</z:hpo> related to pregestational BMI </plain></SENT>
