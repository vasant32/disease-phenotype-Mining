<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies on bimodality have primarily been in populations with a high prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, including one study in a white Caucasian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> studies included participants with known <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess whether a bimodal structure is a general phenomenon in fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) and 2-h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> that is useful for deriving a common cut point for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in populations of different origin, both including and excluding known <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The Evaluation of Screening and Early Detection Strategies for Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>Impaired Glucose Tolerance</z:hpo> (DETECT-2) project is an international collaboration pooling surveys from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> continents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These studies include surveys in which plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was measured during an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test; in total, 43 studies (135,383 participants) from 27 countries were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A mixture of two <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> distributions was fitted to plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, and a cut point for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> glycemia was estimated as their intersection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In populations with a biologically meaningful cut point, bimodality was tested for significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Distributions of FPG and 2-h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> did not, in general, produce bimodal structures useful for deriving cut points for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When present, the cut points produced were inconsistent over geographical regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Deriving cut points for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> glycemia from distributions of FPG and 2-h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> does not appear to be suitable for defining diagnostic cut points for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
