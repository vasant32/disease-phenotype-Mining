<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the impact of comorbid conditions on preventable hospitalizations among Medicare beneficiaries aged &gt; or =65 years with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data were drawn from the 1999 Medicare Standard Analytic Files, a 5% nationally representative random sample of Medicare beneficiaries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The analysis sample included 193,556 Medicare beneficiaries aged &gt; or =65 years with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9-CM codes 250.xx) who were enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Preventable hospitalization was assessed by measuring ambulatory care-sensitive conditions, an accepted measure of hospitalizations that could have been prevented with appropriate outpatient care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariable analyses controlled for demographics; mortality; renal, ophthalmic, or neurological manifestations of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; type of physician providing the outpatient care; and per capita community-level indicators of income and hospital beds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ninety-six percent of beneficiaries in the sample had a comorbidity, and 46% had five or more comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among beneficiaries with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, cardiovascular-related comorbidities were common and accounted for increased odds of preventable hospitalization, controlling for other factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The likelihood of a preventable hospitalization increased in the presence of a claim for comorbid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004929'>coronary atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, or cardiac dysrythmias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Noncardiovascular comorbidities associated with a greater likelihood of preventable hospitalization included <z:hpo ids='HP_0006510'>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo> and lower <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035204" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">respiratory disorders</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, personality/<z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> disorders, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that nearly 7% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> hospitalizations could be avoided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the need for improved outpatient care strategies to reduce the impact of comorbidity on unnecessary hospitalization in patients aged &gt; or =65 years with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
