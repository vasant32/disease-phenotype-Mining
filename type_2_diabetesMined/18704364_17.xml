<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although altered gastrointestinal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25905">peptide hormone</z:chebi> secretion and its relationship with post-surgical improvements in insulin sensitivity has been studied, much less is known about long-term changes in pancreatic and adipose tissue-derived hormones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to conduct a comprehensive longitudinal investigation of the <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> changes following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RYGBP), focusing on pancreatic and adipocyte hormones and systemic markers of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nineteen severely <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> women (BMI 45.6 +/- 1.6 kg/m(2)) were studied prior to RYGBP, and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after RYGBP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Body composition was assessed before surgery and at 1 and 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pre-surgical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> was correlated with circulating adipocyte hormones (leptin, visfatin) and inflammatory molecules (IL-6, high sensitivity C-reactive protein [hsCRP], monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As expected, RYGBP reduced fat mass and fasting insulin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, reductions of fasting pancreatic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (PP) and glucagon concentrations were observed at 1 and 3 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the 12 months following RYGBP, concentrations of most adipocyte hormones (leptin, acylation-stimulating hormone and visfatin, but not <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50211">retinol</z:chebi>-binding hormone-4) and inflammatory molecules (IL-6, hsCRP and soluble intracellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1) were significantly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reductions of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (measured by homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>) were independently associated with changes of glucagon, visfatin and PP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pre-surgical HMW adiponectin concentrations independently predicted losses of body weight and fat mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These results suggest that pancreatic and adipocyte hormones may contribute to the long-term resolution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> after RYGBP </plain></SENT>
