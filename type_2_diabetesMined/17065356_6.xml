<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Prior microarray studies comparing global gene expression patterns in preadipocytes/stromal vascular cells isolated from nonobese nondiabetic versus <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> nondiabetic Pima Indians showed that matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) is upregulated in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The current study targeted analysis of nine additional MMP genes that cluster to a region on chromosome 11q22 that is linked to BMI and percent body fat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Differential-display PCR showed that MMP3 is downregulated in preadipocytes/stromal vascular cells from <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects, and real-time PCR showed that MMP3 expression levels are negatively correlated with percent body fat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To determine whether variants within MMP3 are responsible for its altered expression, MMP3 was sequenced, and seven representative variants were genotyped in 1,037 Pima subjects for association analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two variants were associated with both BMI and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and two additional variants were associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> alone; however, none of these variants were associated with MMP3 expression levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We propose that the MMP3 pathway is altered in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, but this alteration may be the result of a combination of genetic variation within the MMP3 locus itself, as well as variation in additional factors, either primary or secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, that regulate expression of the MMP3 gene </plain></SENT>
