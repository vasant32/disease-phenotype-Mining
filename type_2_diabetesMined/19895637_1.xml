<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Some patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> continue to have high postprandial blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels on twice-daily regimens of 'low-ratio' premix insulin formulations (up to 30% rapid-acting, with 70% protracted insulin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These patients require intensified insulin therapy, which can be provided by a twice- or thrice-daily regimen of mid-ratio (50% rapid-acting and 50% protaminated intermediate-acting insulin - human or analogue) or high-ratio (70% rapid-acting and 30% protaminated insulin - analogue only) premix insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, a third daily injection of low-ratio premix insulin can be added to the regimen, with the option of incorporating one or more injections of mid- or high-ratio premix as required, and as an alternative to basal-bolus therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>How these mid- and high-ratio formulations differ from the low-ratio premix insulins is reviewed here, with the aim of identifying the role of these formulations in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> clamp studies have shown that premix analogues give serum insulin levels proportional to their percentage of rapid-acting uncomplexed insulin: the higher the proportion, the greater the maximum level reached </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other pharmacokinetic parameters were not always significantly different between the mid- and high-ratio formulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In clinical trials, postprandial plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA(1c)) levels were significantly reduced with thrice-daily mid- /high-ratio premix analogue when compared with twice-daily low-ratio biphasic human insulin (BHI) 30/70 or once-daily insulin glargine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, glycaemic control with mid-/high-ratio premix analogue was found to be similar to that with a basal-bolus therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mid- and high-ratio premix regimens are generally well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The frequency of minor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> was reportedly higher with mid- /high-ratio premix analogues than with BHI 30, but nocturnal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> was less frequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although there is little evidence that clinical outcomes with mid-ratio premix analogues are different from those with high-ratio, they are useful additions to the low-ratio formulations for the management of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and addressing postprandial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> in particular </plain></SENT>
