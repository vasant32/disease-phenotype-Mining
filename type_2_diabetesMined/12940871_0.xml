<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study population consisted of 62 patients with type 2 DM, whose antihyperglycaemic treatment program had been stable for at least 3 months, divided into three groups: 26 patients in the SU group, 17 patients in the MET group and 19 patients in the SU + MET group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>None of the patients were taking <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fasting venous blood samples were taken to measure concentrations of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (TG), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>) and remnant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50404">lipoprotein-cholesterol</z:chebi> (RLP-C) as well as for determination of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> particle diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The three groups were similar in terms of age, gender, body mass index and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Total cholesterol concentrations were significantly lower (p &lt; 0.05 for trend) in those treated with SU + MET as compared with the other two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, there were no significant differences between the three groups in their plasma concentrations of TG, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> or RLP-C; furthermore, the proportion of individuals within each treatment group with small <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> particle diameter was also not different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> profile of patients with type 2 DM, matched for level of fasting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e>, was similar irrespective of treatment with SU alone, MET alone or SU + MET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, we could not identify any changes in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> metabolism that could account for differences in risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> as a function of treatment </plain></SENT>
