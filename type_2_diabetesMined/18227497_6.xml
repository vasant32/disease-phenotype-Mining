<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This is very important, since previously, several observational studies in large population-based cohorts have indicated some detrimental effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, even after intentional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, with increased morbidity and mortality rates </plain></SENT>
