<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two studies have identified a version (allele) of a variant in the HNF1B (also known as TCF2) gene that predisposes to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and one of them showed that the same allele protects men from <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other, separate, studies have identified different variants in the JAZF1 gene, one associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, another associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings are unlikely to completely explain the epidemiological association between the two diseases but they provide new insight into a possible direct causal link, rather than one that is confounded or biased in some way </plain></SENT>
