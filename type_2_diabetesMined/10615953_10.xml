<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>Low birth weight</z:hpo> has been reported to be associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948379" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">impaired insulin secretion</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been proposed that this association results from fetal programming in response to the intrauterine environment (the thrifty phenotype hypothesis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the relationship between birth weight and genetically determined defects in insulin secretion, we measured the birth weights of neonates derived from crosses of male pancreatic beta-cell type glucokinase knockout (Gck+/-) mice and female <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) or Gck+/- mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 135 offspring, birth weights were lower in the presence of a fetal heterozygous mutation and higher in the presence of a maternal heterozygous mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, Gck-/- neonates had significantly smaller birth weights than WT or Gck+/- neonates (means +/- SE 1.49+/-0.03 [n = 30] vs. 1.63+/-0.03 [n = 30] or 1.63+/-0.02 [n = 50] g, respectively; P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, Gck mutations in beta-cells may impair insulin response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and alter intrauterine growth as well as <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism after birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study has confirmed the results of a previous report that human subjects carrying mutations in Gck had <z:mp ids='MP_0009674'>reduced birth weights</z:mp> and has provided direct evidence for a link between insulin and fetal growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, birth weights were reduced in insulin receptor substrate-1 knockout mice despite <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> insulin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results suggest that a genetically programmed insulin effect during embryogenesis determines fetal growth and provides a possible molecular link between birth weight and susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
