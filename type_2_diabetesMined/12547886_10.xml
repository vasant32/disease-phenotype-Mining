<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The OGTT is of limited use for population screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most of the increase in cardiovascular risk in relation to increasing blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> occurs before the threshold at which the diagnosis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of HbA(1c) and FPG as predictors of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and cardiovascular risk and, accordingly, to develop a rational approach to screening for abnormalities of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: OGTT and measurement of HbA(1c) and FPG levels were performed in 505 subjects screened for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Anthropomorphic measurements were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factor</z:e> questionnaire was completed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The subjects were aged 19-88 years (mean 53.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 10.4% based on the OGTT and 4% based on an FPG level &gt; or =7.0 mmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), HbA(1c) of &lt;4.7 and &gt; or =6.2% predicted with certainty the absence or presence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> as defined by the OGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The corresponding cutoffs were &lt;5.0 and &gt; or =6.8% for HbA(1c) (DCA2000 HPLC device; Bayer Diagnostics, Mulgrave, Australia) and &lt;4.7 and &gt; or =6.4 mmol/l for FPG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, 75-85% of subjects in each case had intermediate values, which were therefore nondiagnostic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular risk increased at least 2.2 times at an HbA(1c) level &gt; or =6.2% (by HPLC), 1.8-2.2 times at an HbA(1c) level of 5.6-6.1% (by HPLC), 2 times at an FPG level &gt; or =6.4 mmol/l, and 1.7-1.9 times at an FPG level of 5.6-6.3 mmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Measurement of FPG and HbA(1c) levels will diagnose or exclude type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with certainty in a minority (15%) of people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There is a continuous relationship between FPG and HbA(1c) and cardiovascular risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, we propose that there is a rational basis for using either FPG and HbA(1c) for purposes of screening and assigning risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Individuals with an HbA(1c) level of 5.6-6.1% and an FPG level of 5.6-6.3 mmol/l are at greatest risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> and should be targeted for further evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>An algorithm outlining a cost-effective approach is presented </plain></SENT>
