<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The genes for the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> receptor (SUR1; encoded by ABCC8) and its associated islet ATP-sensitive <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channel (Kir6.2; encoded by KCNJ11) are adjacent to one another on human chromosome 11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Multiple studies have reported association of the E23K variant of Kir6.2 with risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whether and how E23K itself-or other variant(s) in either of these two closely linked genes-influences type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> remains to be fully determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To better understand genotype-phenotype correlation at this important candidate gene locus, we 1) characterized haplotype structures across the gene region by typing 77 working, high-frequency markers spanning 207 kb and both genes; 2) performed association studies of E23K and nearby markers in &gt;3,400 patients (type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and control) not previously reported in the literature; and 3) analyzed the resulting data for measures of insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data independently replicate the association of E23K with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with an odds ratio (OR) in the new data of 1.17 (P = 0.003) as compared with an OR of 1.14 provided by meta-analysis of previously published, nonoverlapping data (P = 0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We find that the E23K variant in Kir6.2 demonstrates very strong allelic association with a coding variant (A1369S) in the neighboring SUR1 gene (r(2) &gt; 0.9) across a range of population samples, making it difficult to distinguish which gene and polymorphism in this region are most likely responsible for the reported association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We show that E23K is also associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0003059'>decreased insulin secretion</z:mp> in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-tolerant control subjects, supporting a mechanism whereby <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta-cell dysfunction</z:hpo> contributes to the common form of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Like peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, the SUR1/Kir6.2 gene region both contributes to the inherited risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and encodes proteins that are targets for hypoglycemic medications, providing an intriguing link between the underlying mechanism of disease and validated targets for pharmacological treatment </plain></SENT>
