<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The serum concentration of 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG), a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26191">polyol</z:chebi> which originates mainly in the diet, is used in Japan as a new marker for glycemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the potential interference of 1, 5-AG measurements by traditional Chinese medicines (Kampo), we examined the 1,5-AG content in 32 types of concentrated dosage forms of Kampo using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 32 types of Kampo were the most frequently used in Japan, two of which, Ninjin-yoei-to (7030 microg/g dry weight) and Kami-kihi-to (6700 microg/g dry weight), contained large amounts of 1,5-AG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six others contained small amounts of 1,5-AG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both Ninjin-yoei-to and Kami-kihi-to contain the same ingredient, Polygalae radix, which is a crude form of polygalitol (1,5-AG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To confirm the effects of these Kampo medicines on the serum levels of 1,5-AG, we administered Ninjin-yoei-to (7.5 g/day) for 8 weeks to 18 patients with Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (Type 2 DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The serum level of 1,5-AG increased from 9.8+/-8.9 to 28.1+/-17.5 microg/ml by week 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">Hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA1c) had not changed by week 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, an abnormal serum 1,5-AG level may be present in patients taking Kampo which contains Polygalae radix </plain></SENT>
