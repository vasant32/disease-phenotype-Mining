<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted genetic and molecular studies to better understand the role of PROX1 in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed the impact of the whole common genetic variability of PROX1 (80 SNPs) on type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related biochemical traits in the HELENA (Healthy Lifestyle in Europe by Nutrition in Adolescence) study (n = 1,155) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three SNPs (rs340838, rs340837, and rs340836) were significantly associated with fasting plasma insulin levels (P ≤ 0.00295) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the impact of nine PROX1 SNPs (the three insulin-associated SNPs plus six SNPs in strong linkage disequilibrium) on luciferase reporter gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The insulin-lowering alleles of rs340874, rs340873, and rs340835 were associated with lower luciferase activity in MIN6 and HepG2 cells (except for rs340874 in HepG2 cells only) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that specific nuclear protein bindings occur at the three SNPs in HepG2 cells, with allele-binding differences for rs340874 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also showed that the knockdown of Prox1 expression by small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> in INS-1E cells resulted in a 1.7-fold reduction in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> together, we propose that reduced expression of PROX1 by cis-regulatory variants results in altered β-cell insulin secretion and thereby confers susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
