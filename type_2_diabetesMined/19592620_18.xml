<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: A number of studies have found that <z:mp ids='MP_0009674'>reduced birth weight</z:mp> is associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> later in life; however, the underlying mechanism for this correlation remains unresolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, association has been demonstrated between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birth weight</z:hpo> and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the CDKAL1 and HHEX-IDE loci, regions that were previously implicated in the pathogenesis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to investigate whether type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk-conferring alleles associate with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birth weight</z:hpo> in our Caucasian childhood cohort, we examined the effects of 20 such loci on this trait </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using data from an ongoing genome-wide association study in our cohort of 5,465 Caucasian children with recorded birth weights, we investigated the association of the previously reported type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-associated variation at 20 loci including TCF7L2, HHEX-IDE, PPARG, KCNJ11, SLC30A8, IGF2BP2, CDKAL1, CDKN2A/2B, and JAZF1 with birth weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our data show that the minor allele of rs7756992 (P = 8 x 10(-5)) at the CDKAL1 locus is strongly associated with lower birth weight, whereas a perfect surrogate for variation previously implicated for the trait at the same locus only yielded nominally significant association (P = 0.01; r(2) rs7756992 = 0.677) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, association was not detected with any of the other type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> loci studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We observe association between lower birth weight and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk-conferring alleles at the CDKAL1 locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data show that the same genetic locus that has been identified as a marker for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in previous studies also influences birth weight </plain></SENT>
