<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Multivariate cardiovascular risk scores have been used in many countries to identify individuals who are at high risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These risk scores include those originally developed in individuals with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and those developed in a general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This article reviews the published evidence for the performance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk scores in diabetic patients by: (1) examining the overall rationale for using risk scores; (2) systematically reviewing the literature on available scores; and (3) exploring methodological issues surrounding the development, validation and comparison of risk scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The predictive performance of cardiovascular risk scores varies substantially between different populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There is little evidence to suggest that risk scores developed in individuals with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> estimate cardiovascular risk more accurately than those developed in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The inconsistency in the methods used in evaluation studies makes it difficult to compare and summarise the predictive ability of risk scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk scores rank individuals reasonably accurately and are therefore useful in the management of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with regard to targeting therapy to patients at highest risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, due to the uncertainty in estimation of true risk, care is needed when using scores to communicate absolute <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk to individuals </plain></SENT>
