<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore assessed the effect of fruit with special emphasis on low GI fruit intake in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This secondary analysis involved 152 type 2 diabetic participants treated with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering agents who completed either 6 months of high fibre or low GI dietary advice, including fruit advice, in a parallel design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Change in low GI fruit intake ranged from -3.1 to 2.7 servings/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The increase in low GI fruit intake significantly predicted reductions in HbA(1c) (r = -0.206, p =0.011), systolic blood pressure (r = -0.183, p = 0.024) and CHD risk (r = -0.213, p = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Change in total fruit intake ranged from -3.7 to 3.2 servings/day and was not related to study outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a regression analysis including the eight major carbohydrate foods or classes of foods emphasised in the low GI diet, only low GI fruit and bread contributed independently and significantly to predicting change in HbA(1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, comparing the highest with the lowest quartile of low GI fruit intake, the percentage change in HbA(1c) was reduced by -0.5% HbA(1c) units (95% CI 0.2-0.8 HbA(1c) units, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Low GI fruit consumption as part of a low GI diet was associated with lower HbA(1c), blood pressure and CHD risk and supports a role for low GI fruit consumption in the management of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
