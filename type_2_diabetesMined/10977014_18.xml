<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The offspring of mothers who had <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during pregnancy experience increased risk later of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that, in light of the historical improvements in the management of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during pregnancy, these late consequences of the early environment might be diminishing with time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Birth weight and information on BMI and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance have been collected as part of the epidemiological survey of the Gila River Indian Community in Arizona </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined birth weight, BMI, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in offspring of mothers with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during pregnancy born in four 10-year time intervals since 1955 compared with offspring whose mothers either had not developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetic</z:e> (i.e., developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after the index pregnancy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Offspring of diabetic mothers (ODM) were heavier at birth, had a higher BMI at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ages throughout childhood, and had an increased incidence rate of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in childhood and early adulthood (7- to 20-fold, offspring of nondiabetic mothers [ONDM]; 3- to 5-fold, offspring of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetic</z:e> mothers [OPDM]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Relative differences in birth weight and BMI between ODM and ONDM were greatest for those born before 1965 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In those born after 1965, despite secular trends to higher BMI and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence in the ONDM, differences in BMI and birth weight of ODM versus ONDM and OPDM appeared to have been maintained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: With the possible exception of individuals born before 1965, the increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> experienced by ODM does not seem to be diminishing with time </plain></SENT>
