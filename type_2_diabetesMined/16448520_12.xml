<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a multicentre, double-blind study, 690 patients [body mass index, 33.19 kg/m2 +/- 5.47; <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (A1C), 9.78 +/- 1.51; mean duration, 12.9 years] with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> poorly controlled with a stable insulin dose (&gt; 30 U/day for &gt; or =30 days) were randomly allocated to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> 30 or 45 mg once daily for 24 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> 30- and 45-mg groups, respectively, 71 and 70% of patients completed the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 24 weeks, statistically significant, dose-dependent mean decreases from baseline were seen in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> 30- and 45-mg groups for A1C (-1.17 and -1.46%, respectively) and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (-31.9 and -45.8 mg/dl, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Insulin dosage also decreased significantly (-4.5 and -7.3 U, respectively; p &lt; or = 0.05) from baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Decreases in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> 45 mg: -5.9% (p &lt; or = 0.05)], <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47773">very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> 45 mg: -6.2% (p &lt; or = 0.05)] and free fatty acids [-0.94 (p &lt; or = 0.05) and -2.13 (p &lt; 0.0001) mg/dl, respectively] and increases in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (9.7 and 13.0%, respectively; p &lt; 0.0001) also were observed from baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Small but significant increases in total and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (p &lt; 0.01) from baseline were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> was 2.9 and 3.4 kg in the respective groups; lower limb <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> was reported in 13 and 12% of patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> were not higher than anticipated in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235378,C0348754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">hepatotoxicity</z:e> or clinically significant elevations in liver function test parameters was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with poorly controlled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> to insulin significantly improved glycaemic control, had a positive effect on important components of the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile in a dose-dependent manner and was generally well tolerated </plain></SENT>
