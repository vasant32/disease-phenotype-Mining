<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Of the 606 Sandy Lake Health and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Project cohort subjects who were free of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at baseline, 540 (89.1%) participated in 10-year follow-up assessments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Concentrations of fasting adiponectin, leptin, CRP, IL-6, SAA, and covariates were measured at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and a 75-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test were obtained at baseline and follow-up to determine incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, defined as clinically diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or as fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &gt; or =7.0 mmol/l or 2-h postload plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &gt; or =11.1 mmol/l at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Low adiponectin, high leptin, and low adiponectin-to-leptin ratio at baseline were associated with increased risk of incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after adjustment for age, sex, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (odds ratio 0.63 [95% CI 0.48-0.83], 1.50 [1.02-2.21], and 0.54 [0.37-0.77], respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When the models were additionally adjusted for waist circumference or BMI, however, only low adiponectin remained significantly associated with increased incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (0.68 [0.51-0.90]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Combinations of leptin, CRP, IL-6, and/or SAA with adiponectin, assessed using either the ratio or joint effects, did not improve <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prediction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Low baseline adiponectin is associated with increased risk of incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> independent of leptin, CRP, IL-6, SAA, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> variables including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
