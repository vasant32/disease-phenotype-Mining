<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The incretin hormone glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) reduces plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in type 2 diabetic patients by stimulating insulin secretion and inhibiting glucagon secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3095">biguanide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> is believed to lower plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> without affecting insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted this study to investigate the effect of a combination therapy with GLP-1 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, which could theoretically be additive, in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a semiblinded randomized crossover study, seven patients received treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (1,500 mg daily orally) alternating with GLP-1 (continuous subcutaneous infusion of 2.4 pmol x kg(-1) x min(-1)) alternating with a combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and GLP-1 for 48 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Under fixed energy intake, we examined the effects on plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, glucagon, and appetite </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (day 2) decreased from 13.9 +/- 1 (no treatment) to 11.2 +/- 0.4 (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>) and 11.5 +/- 0.5 (GLP-1) and further decreased to 9.4 +/- 0.7 (combination therapy) (P = 0.0005, no difference between monotherapy with GLP-1 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 24-h mean plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (day 2) decreased from 11.8 +/- 0.5 (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>) and 11.7 +/- 0.8 (GLP-1) to 9.8 +/- 0.5 (combination) (P = 0.02, no difference between GLP-1 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Insulin levels were similar between the three regimens, but glucagon levels were significantly reduced with GLP-1 compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (P = 0.0003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Combination therapy had no additional effect on appetite scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Monotherapy with GLP-1 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> have equal effects on plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and additive effects upon combination </plain></SENT>
