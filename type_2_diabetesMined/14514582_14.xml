<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the meaning of S(i) = 0 derived from the frequently sampled intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The issue of assessing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in large studies is important because the most definitive method ("gold standard"), the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, is expensive and invasive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The frequently sampled intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (FSIGTT) has been widely used, but in insulin-resistant subjects (especially diabetic subjects), it yields considerable numbers of subjects whose S(i) is zero </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The interpretation of an S(i) equaling zero is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: -To address this issue, we examined 1482 subjects from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin Resistance</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Study (IRAS) using an insulin-modified FSIGTT and minimal model calculation of S(i) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The proportion of insulin-resistant subjects (S(i) &lt; 1.61 x 10(-4) [min(-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>microU(-1) x ml(-1)] based on the median of the nondiabetic population) was 38.6% in subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (NGT), 74% in subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT), and 92% in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The proportion of subjects with S(i) = 0 was 2.2% in subjects with NGT, 13.2% in subjects with IGT, and 35.7% in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In subjects with IGT, those with S(i) = 0 had significantly lower <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> levels and higher BMI, waist circumference, fibrinogen, plasminogen-activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), C-reactive protein (CRP), and 2-h insulin levels than insulin-resistant subjects with S(i) &gt; 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, subjects with S(i) = 0 had significantly greater BMI and waist circumference and higher <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>, PAI-1, CRP, fibrinogen, and fasting and 2-h insulin levels than insulin-resistant subjects with S(i) &gt; 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, diabetic subjects with S(i) = 0 had more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disorders</z:e> related to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> syndrome than diabetic insulin-resistant subjects with S(i) &gt; 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found very few subjects with S(i) = 0 among subjects with NGT and few subjects with S(i) = 0 among subjects with IGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In contrast, S(i) = 0 was common in subjects with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Subjects with S(i) = 0 tended to have more features of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> syndrome than other insulin-resistant subjects with S(i) &gt; 0, as would be expected of subjects with almost no insulin-mediated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal, thus suggesting that subjects with S(i) = 0 are correctly classified as being very insulin resistant rather than having failed the minimal model program </plain></SENT>
