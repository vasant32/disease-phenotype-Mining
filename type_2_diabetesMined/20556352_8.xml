<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to investigate the combined effects of multiple genetic variants, alone or in combination with conventional risk factors, on type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related traits in Han Chinese </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We genotyped 17 variants in 17 loci in a population-based Han Chinese cohort including 3,210 unrelated individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A genetic risk score (GRS) was calculated on the basis of these variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The discriminatory ability was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The odds ratio for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> with each GRS point (per risk allele) was 1.18 (95% CI 1.12-1.23, p = 1.3 x 10(-12)) and 1.12 (95% CI 1.09-1.16, p = 7.5 x 10(-14)), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with participants with GRS &lt; or =11.0 (7.63%), those with GRS &gt; or =19.0 (8.87%) had a 4.58-fold higher risk (95% CI 2.49-8.42) of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The GRS also showed a significant association with lower beta cell function estimated by HOMA of beta cell function (p = 8.4 x 10(-10)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, we observed significant interactive effects between GRS and BMI on fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and HbA(1c) levels (p = 0.04 and p = 0.03 for interaction, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Discrimination of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk was improved (p &lt; 0.001) when the GRS was added to a model including clinical risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The AUCs were 0.62 and 0.77, respectively, for the GRS and conventional clinic risk factors alone, and 0.79 when the GRS was added </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In this Han Chinese population, the GRS of 17 combined variants modestly but significantly improved discrimination of the conventional risk factors for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
