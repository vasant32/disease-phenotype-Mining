<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we recruited seven healthy first-degree relatives of type 2 diabetic patients and seven pairwise, matched, healthy control subjects without any heredity for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects were studied with a euglycemic insulin clamp at approximately 600 pmol/l, abdominal subcutaneous microdialysis, and (133)Xe clearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a subcutaneous needle biopsy was performed to determine fat cell size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the fasting state, interstitial <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> was 40% higher in relatives than in control subjects (P = 0.043), but net <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> production was similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, during the insulin clamp, interstitial <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> (2.50 +/- 0.29 vs. 1.98 +/- 0.26 mmol/l, P = 0.018), interstitial-arterial <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> concentration difference (1.08 +/- 0.30 vs. 0.53 +/- 0.24 mmol/l, P = 0.028), and net <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> release per fat cell (10.9 +/- 3.7 vs. 2.8 +/- 1.3 fmol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>cell(-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>min(-1), P = 0.018) were increased in the relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that first-degree relatives of type 2 diabetic patients may have an enhanced net <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> release per fat cell in abdominal subcutaneous tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This could suggest a pathological regulation in adipose tissue that is of importance for the metabolic defects known in type 2 diabetic relatives </plain></SENT>
