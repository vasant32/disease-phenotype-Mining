<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently, an association of the G allele in UCSNP-43 of calpain 10 with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and decreased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal was reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Calpain 10 is also expressed in pancreatic islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is not known, however, whether and how this polymorphism contributes to the biological variation of beta-cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied 73 nondiabetic subjects from the southwest region of Germany (G/G, n = 41; G/A, n = 29; and A/A, n = 3) using a modified hyperglycemic clamp (10 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, added glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> 1, final arginine bolus) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The genotype distribution was not different between subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (n = 56) and those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (n = 17; P = 0.74, chi2 test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>First-phase insulin secretion (adjusted for sex and insulin sensitivity from hyperglycemic clamp) was greater in G/G (2,747 +/- 297 pmol/min) than in G/A + A/A (1,612 +/- 156 pmol/min, P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Insulin secretion in response to arginine (adjusted for insulin sensitivity) was also greater in G/G (9,648 +/- 1,186 pmol/min) than in G/A + A/A (5,686 +/- 720 pmol/min, P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> poststimulus proinsulin-to-insulin ratio was lower in G/G (1.6 +/- 0.4% first phase; 1.6 +/- 0.2% arginine) than in G/A + A/A (4.0 +/- 0.5% first phase, P &lt; 0.001; 2.5 +/- 0.4% arginine, P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, it appears unlikely that any association of the UCSNP-43 polymorphism alone with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> involves impairment of insulin secretion in our population of German Caucasians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This may be entirely different with specific haplotype combinations </plain></SENT>
