<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have developed a model of uteroplacental insufficiency, a common cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001511'>intrauterine growth retardation</z:hpo>, in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bilateral uterine artery ligation was performed on day 19 of gestation (term is 22 days) in the pregnant rat; sham-operated pregnant rats served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Birth weights of intrauterine growth-retarded (IUGR) animals were significantly lower than those of controls until approximately 7 weeks of age, when IUGR rats caught up to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Between 7 and 10 weeks of age, the growth of IUGR rats accelerated and surpassed that of controls, and by 26 weeks of age, IUGR rats were <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (P &lt; 0.05 vs. controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were observed in blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and plasma insulin levels at 1 week of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, between 7 and 10 weeks of age, IUGR rats developed mild fasting <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.05 vs. controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At age 26 weeks, IUGR animals had markedly elevated levels of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.05 vs. controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>IUGR animals were <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-intolerant and insulin-resistant at an early age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>First-phase insulin secretion in response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was also impaired early in life in IUGR rats, before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in beta-cell mass, islet size, or pancreatic weight between IUGR and control animals at 1 and 7 weeks of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, in 15-week-old IUGR rats, the relative beta-cell mass was 50% that of controls, and by 26 weeks of age, beta-cell mass was less than one-third that of controls (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The data presented here support the hypothesis that an abnormal intrauterine milieu can induce permanent changes in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis after birth and lead to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in adulthood </plain></SENT>
