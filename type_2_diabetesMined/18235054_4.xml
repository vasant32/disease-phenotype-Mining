<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a prospective study of 3,562 nondiabetic men aged 60-79 years followed up for an average of 7 years during which there were 162 incident cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Elevated t-PA (top third) was associated with a near threefold increase in risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with the risk in those in the bottom third after adjustment for lifestyle factors and waist circumference (relative risk [RR] 2.98 [95%CI 1.79-5.00]; P(trend) &lt; 0.0001); weaker but significant (marginal) associations were seen with vWF (1.24 [0.83-1.85]; P = 0.05 for trend) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both biomarkers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> correlated significantly with markers of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> (interleukin-6 [IL-6] and C-reactive protein [CRP]), hepatic function (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="24190">gamma-glutamyl</z:chebi> transferase [GGT]), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, with t-PA showing stronger associations with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e>, hepatic function, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> than vWF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>t-PA was also significantly and inversely associated with adiponectin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adjustment for IL-6, adiponectin, and GGT attenuated the association of incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with vWF (1.06 [0.71-1.60]), but the relationship seen with t-PA remained significant (adjusted RR 2.19 [1.29-3.70]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subsequent adjustment for insulin attenuated the association further, but t-PA was still associated with a significant increase in risk (1.66 [0.96-2.85]; P(trend) = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: t-PA antigen, but not vWF antigen, is independently associated with risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
