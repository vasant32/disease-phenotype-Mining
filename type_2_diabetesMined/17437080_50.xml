<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Study I (the DPS) included 507 individuals with IGT who were randomly allocated to control and intervention groups and followed for an average of 3.9 years to monitor for progression to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Study II was a population-based cross-sectional study of 1,766 men, aged 50-70 years, randomly selected from the population of Kuopio, eastern Finland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Study III included 238 non-diabetic offspring of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genotyping of rs12255372 and rs7903146 of TCF7L2 was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the DPS, the TT genotype of rs12255372 was significantly associated with an adjusted 2.85-fold risk (95% CI 1.17-6.95, p = 0.021) of incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the control group, but not in the intervention group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In Study II, the adjusted odds ratio in subjects with the TT genotype was 3.40 (1.45-7.97, p = 0.005) for the comparison of diabetic subjects with normoglycaemic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The T allele of rs12255372 was significantly associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0003059'>decreased insulin secretion</z:mp> (Studies II, III) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Expression of TCF7L2 in adipose tissue tended to be lower in subjects with the TT risk genotypes of rs12255372 and rs7903146 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The variant of rs12255372 of TCF7L2 was associated with incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the DPS and in a separate population-based cross-sectional study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948379" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Impaired insulin secretion</z:e> is likely to be the main cause for our findings </plain></SENT>
