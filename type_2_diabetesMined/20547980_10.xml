<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: C57Bl/6 mice develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> when fed a high-fat diet (HFD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although diet-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (DIO) is a widely studied model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, little is known about beta-cell failure in these mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: DIO mice were separated in two groups according to body <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>: low- and high-HFD responders (LDR and HDR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined whether mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> in HDR mice is due to reduced beta-cell mass or function and studied islet metabolism and signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HDR mice were more <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, hyperinsulinemic, insulin resistant, and hyperglycemic and showed a more altered plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile than LDR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LDR mice largely compensated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, whereas HDR showed perturbed <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neither LDR nor HDR mice showed reduced beta-cell mass, altered islet <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> deposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Insulin secretion in response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi>, and arginine was impaired in LDR and almost abolished in HDR islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">Palmitate</z:chebi> partially restored <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>- and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi>-stimulated secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced rise in ATP was reduced in both DIO groups, and the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced rise in Ca(2+) was reduced in HDR islets relatively to LDR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated lipolysis was decreased in LDR and HDR islets, whereas fat oxidation was increased in HDR islets only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Fatty acid esterification processes were markedly diminished, and free cholesterol accumulated in HDR islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: beta-Cell failure in HDR mice is not due to reduced beta-cell mass and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>steatosis</z:hpo> but to a secretory dysfunction that is possibly due to altered ATP/Ca(2+) and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> signaling, as well as free <z:mpath ids='MPATH_642'>cholesterol deposition</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
