<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clamp studies using maximal insulin concentrations have revealed defects in activation of aPKC, but not PKB, in both <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> non-diabetic and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, clamp studies using submaximal insulin concentrations revealed defects in PKB activation/phosphorylation in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> non-diabetic and diabetic subjects, but changes in aPKC were not reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that dose-related effects of insulin may account for the reported differences in insulin signalling to PKB in diabetic muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We compared enzymatic activation of aPKC and PKB, and PKB phosphorylation (threonine-308 and serine-473) during hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp studies using both submaximal (400-500 pmol/l) and maximal (1400 pmol/l) insulin levels in non-diabetic control and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In lean control subjects, the submaximal insulin concentration increased aPKC activity and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal to approximately 50% of the maximal level and PKBbeta activity to 25% of the maximal level, but PKBalpha activity was not increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In these subjects, phosphorylation of PKBalpha and PKBbeta was increased to near-maximal levels at submaximal insulin concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> diabetic subjects, whereas aPKC activation was defective at submaximal and maximal insulin concentrations, PKBbeta activation and the phosphorylation of PKBbeta and PKBalpha were defective at submaximal, but not maximal, insulin concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATIONS: Defective PKBbeta activation/phosphorylation, seen on submaximal insulin stimulation in diabetic muscle, may largely reflect impaired activation of insulin signalling factors present in concentrations greater than those needed for full PKB activation/phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Defective aPKC activation, seen at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> insulin levels, appears to reflect, at least partly, an impaired action of distal factors needed for aPKC activation, or poor aPKC responsiveness </plain></SENT>
