<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we addressed the potential role of Kupffer cells (liver-specific macrophages, KCs) in these <z:mp ids='MP_0005266'>metabolic abnormalities</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Rats were depleted of KCs by administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37288">gadolinium chloride</z:chebi>, after which <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals were exposed to a 2-week high-fat or high-<z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, the effects of these interventions on the development of hepatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>steatosis</z:hpo> were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In further studies, the effects of M1-polarized KCs on hepatocyte <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism and insulin sensitivity were addressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: As expected, a high-fat or high-<z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> diet induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>steatosis</z:hpo> and hepatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, these <z:mp ids='MP_0005266'>metabolic abnormalities</z:mp> were prevented when liver was depleted of KCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In vitro, KCs recapitulated the in vivo effects of diet by increasing hepatocyte <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> accumulation and fatty acid esterification, and decreasing fatty acid oxidation and insulin responsiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To address the mechanisms(s) of KC action, we inhibited a panel of cytokines using neutralizing antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only neutralizing antibodies against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNFalpha) attenuated KC-induced alterations in hepatocyte fatty acid oxidation, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> accumulation, and insulin responsiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Importantly, KC TNFalpha levels were increased by diet in vivo and in isolated M1-polarized KCs in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate a role for liver macrophages in diet-induced alterations in hepatic <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism and insulin sensitivity, and suggest a role for these cells in the etiology of the <z:mp ids='MP_0005266'>metabolic abnormalities</z:mp> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>/type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
