<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine whether <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is associated with reduced lung function, we studied 421 Anglo-Celt/European subjects, representing 20.5% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> identified in an urban Australian catchment area of 120097 people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition to collection of detailed demographic and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-specific data, spirometry was performed and forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), vital capacity (VC) and peak expiratory flow (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="55310">PEF</z:chebi>) measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When expressed as a percentage of those predicted (%pred) for age, sex and height, the means of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> spirometric measures were reduced by &gt; or =9.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After controlling for smoking, age and gender in a linear regression model, HbA(1c) was not associated with any measure of lung function (P&gt;0.13) but <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration was significantly associated with FEV1(%pred) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="55310">PEF</z:chebi>(%pred) (P&lt; or =0.04) and had borderline associations with FVC(%pred) and VC(%pred) (P&lt; or =0.064) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In separate analyses controlling for smoking alone, age, body mass index (BMI), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> (CHD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> were independently and inversely associated with FVC(%pred), FEV1(%pred) and VC(%pred) (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In sub-group analyses, these three spirometric measures were associated with BMI, CHD and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration in males, and age and BMI in females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary function is reduced in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> duration seems a more important influence than glycaemic control, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> may also contribute </plain></SENT>
