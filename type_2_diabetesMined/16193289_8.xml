<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether this may be due to differences in the microvasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: To assess the maximum hyperaemic response to heating and the post-ischaemic response, Laser Doppler fluximetry was performed on 51 and 100 Europeans, and on 66 and 88 African Caribbeans with and without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects were aged between 40 and 65 years and recruited from the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Echocardiographic interventricular septal thickness (IVST) was measured as a proxy for vascular target organ damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In diabetic subjects of both ethnic groups, the maximum hyperaemic response and peak response to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> were attenuated as compared to the corresponding non-diabetic subjects (p=0.08 for diabetic and 0.03 for non-diabetic Europeans; p=0.03 and 0.1 for African Caribbeans) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adjustment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, in particular insulin and blood pressure, abolished these differences in Europeans (p=0.8 for diabetic and 0.2 for non-diabetic Europeans), but not in African Caribbeans (p=0.03 and 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Persisting microvascular dysfunction in African Caribbeans may contribute to the increased risk of target organ damage observed in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The weak contribution of conventional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> to these disturbances indicates that conventional therapeutic interventions may be less beneficial in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a risk-factor-independent, inverse association between IVST and maximal hyperaemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These ethnic differences in microvascular responses to temperature and <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> could account for increased target organ damage in African Caribbeans </plain></SENT>
