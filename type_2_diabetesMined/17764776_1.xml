<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between probable NAFLD and T2DM in non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, non-alcoholic consuming Filipino-American women aged 48-73 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The UCSD Filipino Women's Health Study measured <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, hepatic enzymes, adiponectin and visceral fat (VAT) during clinical visits (1995-2002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We defined T2DM by 1999 WHO criteria and probable NAFLD as ALT &gt;31 U/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Prevalence of T2DM was 34.4% and probable NAFLD was 17.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Women with T2DM (n=56) had higher VAT, total:<z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, SBP, fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin, postchallenge <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, ALT (28.7 U/L versus 19.1 U/L, p&lt;0.0001), GGT, AST, and probable NAFLD (32.1% versus 9.35%, p=0.0002) and lower adiponectin than those without T2DM (n=107) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>GGT (p=0.0008) and ALT (p=0.002) were associated with increasing VAT levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Probable NAFLD was independently associated with T2DM (AOR 6.32, 95% CI 2.2-18.0), after adjusting for risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Probable NAFLD was elevated and associated with T2DM, independent of VAT, adiponectin and other risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ALT may serve as a useful marker for NAFLD or <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk in Filipino women </plain></SENT>
