<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This reduces K(ATP) channel activity, leading to depolarization, activation of voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels, Ca(2+) entry and insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this paradigm, loss-of-function mutations in the genes (KCNJ11 and ABCC8) that encode the two subunits (Kir6.2 and SUR1, respectively) of the ATP-sensitive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> (K(ATP)) channel underlie <z:mp ids='MP_0002079'>hyperinsulinism</z:mp> in humans, a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorder</z:e> characterized by dysregulated insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In mice with genetic suppression of K(ATP) channel subunit expression, partial loss of K(ATP) channel conductance also causes hypersecretion, but unexpectedly, complete loss results in an undersecreting, mildly <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-intolerant phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When challenged by a high-fat diet, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mice and mice with reduced K(ATP) channel density respond with hypersecretion, but mice with more significant or complete loss of K(ATP) channels cross over, or progress further, to an undersecreting, diabetic phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is our contention that in mice, and perhaps in humans, there is an inverse U-shaped response to hyperexcitabilty, leading first to hypersecretion but with further exacerbation to undersecretion and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The causes of the overcompensation and diabetic susceptibility are poorly understood but may have broader implications for the progression of <z:mp ids='MP_0002079'>hyperinsulinism</z:mp> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in humans </plain></SENT>
