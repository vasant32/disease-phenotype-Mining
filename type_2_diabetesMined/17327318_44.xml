<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine differences between structured interviews, symptom questionnaires, and distress measures for assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We assessed 506 diabetic patients for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1269683" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="MDD">major depressive disorder</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDD</z:e>) by a structured interview (Composite International Diagnostic Interview [CIDI]), a questionnaire for depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiological Studies <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Scale [CESD]), and on the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Distress Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Demographic characteristics, two biological variables (A1C and non-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>), and four behavioral management measures (kilocalories, calories of saturated fat, number of fruit and vegetable servings, and minutes of physical activity) were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Comparisons were made between those with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> on the CIDI and the CESD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Findings showed that 22% of patients reached CESD &gt; or = 16, and 9.9% met a CIDI diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of those above CESD cut points, 70% were not clinically depressed, and 34% of those who were clinically depressed did not reach CESD scores &gt; or = 16 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Those scoring &gt; or = 16, compared with those &lt; 16 on the CESD, had higher A1C, kilocalories, and calories of saturated fat and lower physical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No differences were found using the CIDI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> distress was minimally related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDD</z:e> but substantively linked to CESD scores and to outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and high levels of depressive symptoms are not clinically depressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The CESD may be more reflective of general emotional and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-specific distress than clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Most treatment of distress, however, is based on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> literature, which suggests the need to consider different interventions for distressed but not clinically depressed diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
