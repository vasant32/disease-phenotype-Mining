<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To investigate the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics and safety of the glucokinase activator AZD6370 after 1 day of administration under fed and fasted conditions in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a two-part study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In Part A, patients received a single oral dose of AZD6370 (20, 60 or 180 mg) or placebo in the fasted or fed states (both n=8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In Part B, patients (n=8) received placebo and a total dose of AZD6370 180 mg given in one, two or four divided doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> changes versus placebo were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: AZD6370 provided dose-dependent reductions in plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> of up to 30% versus placebo in both fasted and fed patients (p&lt;0.001 at 60 and 180 mg doses) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Insulin secretion increased with dose, but absolute increases were relatively small in the fasted versus fed state (0-4 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Dosing AZD6370 twice or four-times over 1 day gave a smoother 24-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> profile than single-dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>AZD6370 was rapidly absorbed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pharmacokinetics of AZD6370 were dose-independent and unaffected by food </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>AZD6370 was generally well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: AZD6370 produced dose-dependent <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> reductions and increased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion in patients with T2DM </plain></SENT>
