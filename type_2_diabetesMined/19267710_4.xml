<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied the 865 patients who survived during 12 months without any change in their <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering (GL) therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were divided into four subgroups according to GL treatment: group I, no pharmacological GL treatment (n = 99); group II, oral hypoglycaemic agents (n = 250); group III, new insulin treatment (n = 245) and group IV, insulin before inclusion continued during the first year of follow up (n = 271) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients who started on insulin (group III) experienced an average body weight increase of 2.3 (1.5-3.2) kg during the first year of treatment, whereas weight remained unchanged in groups I, II and IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of non-fatal reinfarction was higher in group III compared with the other groups (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.5, p = 0.011) and CV mortality was higher in group IV (HR = 2.4, p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When the subjects were grouped in quartiles according to maximal body weight increase, those in the lowest quartile experienced the highest CV mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Each kilogram increase in weight reduced the risk for CV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> with 6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of reinfarction did not differ between quartiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Initiation of insulin treatment after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> was associated with a significant increase in weight and incidence of reinfarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The increase in weight did, however, not explain the increased rate of reinfarction </plain></SENT>
