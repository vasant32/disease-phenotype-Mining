<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Gene polymorphisms were genotyped in 394 type 2 diabetic patients and 418 healthy control subjects in this case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used the multifactor dimensionality reduction method to identify gene-gene interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No single locus was associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, except for the insert/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the ACE gene in female subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In multi-locus analyses, in male subjects the model of rs2106809 (ACE2), rs220721 (Mas), rs699 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AGT</z:e>), and I/D (ACE) was significant (P = 0.043) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This combination was associated with a 4.00 times (95% CI 2.51-6.38; P &lt; 0.0001) greater prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In female subjects, the model of rs2106809 (ACE2), I/D (ACE), and rs1403543 (AGTR2) was significant (P = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This three-locus combination was associated with a 2.76 times (1.91-3.97; P &lt; 0.0001) greater prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Interactions among <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>-related genes were associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a Chinese population </plain></SENT>
