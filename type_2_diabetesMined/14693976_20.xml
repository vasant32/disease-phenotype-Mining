<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e> uses routinely available data from primary care records to identify people at high risk for undiagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e> cut point of 0.199 were 77, 72, and 80% (95% CI 68-91), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The risk score was calculated for 248 Caribbean and 555 South Asian participants aged 40-75 years in the 1999 Health Survey for England </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Undiagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> was considered present if fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was &gt;/=7.0 mmol/l or HbA(1c) was &gt;/=6.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values were calculated for various cut points of the risk score, and ROC curves were constructed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The area under the ROC curve was 67% (59-76) and 72% (67-78) for Caribbeans and South Asians, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The optimal cut point in Caribbean participants was 0.236, sensitivity was 63% (46-77), and specificity was 63% (56-69) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the South Asian population, the optimal cut point was and 0.127, sensitivity was 69% (60-78), and specificity was 64% (60-69) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e>, using routinely available data, can be used in a strategy to detect undiagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> in Caribbean and South Asian populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The existence of ethnic group-specific cut points must be further established in future studies </plain></SENT>
