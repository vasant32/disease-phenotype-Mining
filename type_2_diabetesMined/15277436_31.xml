<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e>, and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> causes <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> or is an epiphenomenon of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> remains unresolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine whether first-degree relatives of type 2 diabetic subjects differ in insulin sensitivity from control subjects without a family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, whether first-degree relatives of type 2 diabetic subjects and control subjects differ in CRP, adiponectin, and complement levels, and whether CRP is related to insulin sensitivity independently of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 19 young normoglycemic nonobese first-degree relatives of type 2 diabetic subjects and 22 control subjects who were similar for age, sex, and BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity (<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion rate [GIR]) was measured by the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry determined total and abdominal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging measured abdominal adipose tissue volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: First-degree relatives of type 2 diabetic subjects had a 20% lower GIR than the control group (51.8 +/- 3.9 vs. 64.9 +/- 4.6 micromol x min(-1) x kg fat-free mass(-1), P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, first-degree relatives of subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and those without a family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and comparable levels of CRP, adiponectin, and complement proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When the cohort was examined as a whole, CRP was inversely related to GIR (r = -0.33, P = 0.04) and adiponectin (r = -0.34, P = 0.03) and positively related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> (P &lt; 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, CRP was not related to GIR independently of fat mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast to C3 (r = 0.41, P = 0.009) and factor B (r = 0.43, P = 0.005), CRP was unrelated to factor D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The insulin-resistant state is not associated with changes in inflammatory markers or complement proteins in subjects at high risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our study confirms a strong relationship between CRP and fat mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Increasing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> may interact to raise CRP levels </plain></SENT>
