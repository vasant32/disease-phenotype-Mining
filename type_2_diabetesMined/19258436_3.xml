<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our study investigated potential relationships between nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways-two pathways proposed as the link between CLAIS and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Adiposity</z:e> (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and insulin sensitivity (M, hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp) were measured in 22 healthy nondiabetic volunteers (aged 29 +/- 11 years, body fat 28 +/- 11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NF-kappaB activity (DNA-binding assay) and JNK1/2 activity (phosphorylated JNK) were assessed in biopsies of the vastus lateralis muscle and subcutaneous adipose tissue and in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) lysates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: NF-kappaB activities in PBMCs and muscle were positively associated with WHR after adjustment for age, sex, and percent body fat (both P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>NF-kappaB activity in PBMCs was inversely associated with M after adjustment for age, sex, percent body fat, and WHR (P = 0.02) and explained 16% of the variance of M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no significant relationships between NF-kappaB activity and M in muscle or adipose tissue (both NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adipose-derived JNK1/2 activity was not associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P&gt; 0.1), although it was inversely related to M (r = -0.54, P &lt; 0.05) and explained 29% of its variance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When both NF-kappaB and JNK1/2 were examined statistically, only JNK1/2 activity in adipose tissue was a significant determinant of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: JNK1/2 activity in adipose tissue but not NF-kappaB activity in PBMCs is an independent determinant of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
