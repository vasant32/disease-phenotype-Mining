<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We simulated screening with random plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (RPG) and cut points of 100, 130, and 160 mg/dl and a multivariate equation including RPG and other variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Over 15 years, we simulated screening at intervals of 1, 3, and 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> positive screening tests were followed by a diagnostic fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> or an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Outcomes include the numbers of false-negative, true-positive, and false-positive screening tests and the direct and indirect costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At year 15, screening every 3 years with an RPG cut point of 100 mg/dl left 0.2 million false negatives, an RPG of 130 mg/dl or the equation left 1.3 million false negatives, and an RPG of 160 mg/dl left 2.8 million false negatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Over 15 years, the absolute difference between the most sensitive and most specific screening strategy was 4.5 million true positives and 476 million false-positives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Strategies using RPG cut points of 130 mg/dl or the multivariate equation every 3 years identified 17.3 million true positives; however, the equation identified fewer false-positives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The total cost of the most sensitive screening strategy was $42.7 billion and that of the most specific strategy was $6.9 billion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Screening for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> every 3 years with an RPG cut point of 130 mg/dl or the multivariate equation provides good yield and minimizes false-positive screening tests and costs </plain></SENT>
