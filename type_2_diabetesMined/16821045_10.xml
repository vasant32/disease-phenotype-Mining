<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using a mouse model, we tested whether in utero exposure to Ljungan virus (LV) followed by adult exposure to stress produces <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The influence of the timing of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> exposure over the course of pregnancy was also tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pregnant CD-1 mice were exposed i.p. to LV on pregnancy days 4, 8, 12 or 17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adult male mice from these pregnancies were stressed by being kept in shared cages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stress only, LV exposure in utero only, and no-stress/no virus exposure groups were also followed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Outcome variables included bodyweight, epididymal fat weight, baseline <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests (60 and 120 min) and serum insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We demonstrated that male mice developed a type 2-like <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, as adults if infected during pregnancy with LV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> at the age of 11 weeks was more severe in mice whose mothers were infected earlier than in those whose mothers were infected later in pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only animals infected in utero and kept under stress developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> or stress alone did not cause disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: This work demonstrates that a type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-like disease can be virus-induced in a mouse model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Early in utero <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> insults can set the stage for disease occurring during adult life, but the final manifestation of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is dependent on the combination of early <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> exposure and stress in adult life </plain></SENT>
