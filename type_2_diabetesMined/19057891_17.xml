<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, most studies have been conducted in white groups and it is not clear whether these models apply to Asian populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to construct a simple points model for predicting incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among Chinese people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We estimated the 10 year risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a cohort study of middle-aged and elderly participants who were free from <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cox regression coefficients were used to construct the simple points model and the discriminatory ability of the resulting prediction rule was determined using AUC and net reclassification improvement and integrated discrimination improvement statistics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fivefold random splitting was used to test the internal validity and obtain bootstrap estimates of the AUC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 2,960 participants without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at the baseline examination, 548 developed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during a median 10 year follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Age (four points), elevated fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (11 points), body mass index (eight points), triacylglycerol (five points), white blood cell count (four points) and a higher <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> (negative four points) were found to strongly predict <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence in a multivariate model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The estimated AUC for the model was 0.702 (95% CI 0.676-0.727) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This model performed better than existing prediction models developed in other populations, including the Prospective Cardiovascular MÃ¼nster, Cambridge, San Antonia and Framingham models for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We have constructed a model for predicting the 10 year incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Chinese people that could be useful for identifying individuals at high risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the Chinese population </plain></SENT>
