<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM), vildagliptin improves beta-cell function, measured as insulin secretory rate relative to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level, and reduces glucagon secretion and endogenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production in the postprandial period, resulting in reduced <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In clinical trials in T2DM, vildagliptin 100 mg/day monotherapy is effective in reducing <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA1c) across the spectrum of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> and has maintained efficacy over long-term treatment with neutral effects on body weight and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Vildagliptin is associated with a low risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e>, and has an adverse event profile comparable to placebo, including a reduced rate of gastrointestinal adverse effects compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and a reduced rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As add-on combination therapy, vildagliptin produces significant further reductions in HbA1c in patients receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> and insulin, and has been found to reduce frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> as an add-on to insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Preliminary findings indicate that the improved islet cell function underlying the efficacy of vildagliptin in T2DM is also observed in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo>, with vildagliptin treatment resulting in reduced glycaemic excursions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall profile of vildagliptin and the preliminary evidence of beneficial effects in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetic state</z:e> suggest that DPP-4 inhibition could be an effective strategy to prevent or delay progression from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetic state</z:e> to overt T2DM </plain></SENT>
