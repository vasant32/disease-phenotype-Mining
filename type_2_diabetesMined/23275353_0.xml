<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVETo examine whether the patterns of insulin concentration during the oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) predict type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSWe followed 400 nondiabetic Japanese Americans for 10-11 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Insulin concentrations at 30, 60, and 120 min during a 2-h 75-g OGTT at baseline were used to derive the following possible patterns of insulin: pattern 1 (30-min peak, higher insulin level at 60 than at 120 min), pattern 2 (30-min peak, lower or equal level at 60 vs. 120 min), pattern 3 (60-min peak); pattern 4 (120-min peak, lower level at 30 than at 60 min), and pattern 5 (120-min peak, equal or higher level at 30 vs. 60 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity was estimated by homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-IR) and Matsuda index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Insulin secretion was estimated by the insulinogenic index (IGI) [Δinsulin/Δ<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (30-0 min)] and disposition index (IGI/HOMA-IR).RESULTSThere were 86 incident cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence was 3.2, 9.8, 15.4, 47.8, and 37.5% for patterns 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with pattern 1, patterns 4 and 5, characterized by a lasting late insulin response, were associated with significantly less insulin sensitivity as measured by the Matsuda index and lower early insulin response by the disposition index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The multiple-adjusted odds ratios of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were 12.55 (95% CI 4.79-32.89) for pattern 4 and 8.34 (2.38-29.27) for pattern 5 compared with patterns 1 and 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This association was independent of insulin secretion and sensitivity.CONCLUSIONThe patterns of insulin concentration during an OGTT strongly predict the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
