<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the mechanisms underlying the association between birth weight and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a population-based study of 3,061 Pima Indians aged 5-29 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> and insulin concentrations were measured during a 75-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> was estimated according to the homeostatic model (homeostasis model assessment-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> [HOMA-IR]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Relationships between birth weight, height, weight, fasting and postload concentrations of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin, and HOMA-IR were examined with multiple regression analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Birth weight was positively related to current weight and height (P &lt; 0.0001, controlled for age and sex, in each age-group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations showed a U-shaped relationship with birth weight in subjects &gt; 10 years of age, and this relation was independent of current body size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 2,272 nondiabetic subjects, after adjustment for weight and height, fasting and 2-h insulin concentrations and HOMA-IR were negatively correlated with birth weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>Low-birth-weight</z:hpo> Pimas are thinner at ages 5-29 years, yet they are more insulin resistant relative to their body size than those of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> birth weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By contrast, those with high birth weight are more <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> but less insulin resistant relative to their body size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low-birth-weight</z:hpo> Pima Indians may explain their increased risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
