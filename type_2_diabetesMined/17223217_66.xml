<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The primary assessment was change from baseline to endpoint in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (A1C), comparing vildagliptin to placebo by ANCOVA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Baseline A1C averaged 8.4% and the between-treatment difference (vildagliptin-placebo) in adjusted mean change (AMDelta) in A1C was -0.5+/-0.2% (P=0.011), -0.7+/-0.2% (P&lt;0.001), and -0.9+/-0.2% (P&lt;0.001) in patients receiving vildagliptin 50 mg qd, 50 mg bid, or 100 mg qd, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Baseline FPG averaged 10.5 mmol/L; the between-treatment difference in AMDelta FPG was -0.6+/-0.4 mmol/L in patients receiving vildagliptin 50mg qd and -1.3+/-0.4 mmol/L (P=0.001) in both groups receiving 100mg daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Relative to baseline, body weight did not change significantly in any of the three vildagliptin groups and decreased by 1.4+/-0.4 kg in the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adverse events (AEs) occurred with similar frequency in each group: 55.8%, 59.3%, 59.3%, and 57.6% of patients receiving vildagliptin 50 mg qd, 50 mg bid, 100 mg qd, or placebo, respectively, experienced an AE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No confirmed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> was reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: Vildagliptin is effective and well-tolerated in drug-naïve patients with T2DM and 100 mg vildagliptin provides similar clinical benefit whether given as single or in divided doses </plain></SENT>
