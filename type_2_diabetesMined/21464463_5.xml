<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Participants were 1,228 (523 men and 705 women) adults of Indian or Pakistani origin screened for the Prevention of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> in South Asians (PODOSA) trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> undertook an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test, had physical activity and sitting time assessed by International Physical Activity Questionnaire, and had waist circumference measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean ± SD age and waist circumference were 49.8 ± 10.1 years and 99.2 ± 10.2 cm, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One hundred ninety-one participants had impaired fasting glycemia or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo>, and 97 had possible type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In multivariate regression analysis, age (0.012 mmol ⋅ L⁻¹ ⋅ year⁻¹ [95% CI 0.006-0.017]) and waist circumference (0.018 mmol ⋅ L⁻¹ ⋅ cm⁻¹ [0.012-0.024]) were significantly independently associated with fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration, and age (0.032 mmol ⋅ L⁻¹ ⋅ year⁻¹ [0.016-0.049]), waist (0.057 mmol ⋅ L⁻¹ ⋅ cm⁻¹ [0.040-0.074]), and sitting time (0.097 mmol ⋅ L⁻¹ ⋅ h⁻¹ ⋅ day⁻¹ [0.036-0.158]) were significantly independently associated with 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vigorous activity time had a borderline significant association with 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration (-0.819 mmol ⋅ L⁻¹ ⋅ h⁻¹ ⋅ day⁻¹ [-1.672 to 0.034]) in the multivariate model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data highlight an important relationship between sitting time and 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels in U.K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>South Asians, independent of physical activity and waist circumference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although the data are cross-sectional and thus do not permit firm conclusions about causality to be drawn, the results suggest that further study investigating the effects of sitting time on glycemia and other aspects of metabolic risk in South Asian populations is warranted </plain></SENT>
