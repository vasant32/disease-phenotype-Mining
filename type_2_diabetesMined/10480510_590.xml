<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Several methods have been proposed to evaluate insulin sensitivity from the data obtained from the oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the validity of these indices has not been rigorously evaluated by comparing them with the direct measurement of insulin sensitivity obtained with the euglycemic insulin clamp technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we compare various insulin sensitivity indices derived from the OGTT with whole-body insulin sensitivity measured by the euglycemic insulin clamp technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this study, 153 subjects (66 men and 87 women, aged 18-71 years, BMI 20-65 kg/m2) with varying degrees of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (62 subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, 31 subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo>, and 60 subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After a 10-h overnight fast, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects underwent, in random order, a 75-g OGTT and a euglycemic insulin clamp, which was performed with the infusion of [3-3H]<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The indices of insulin sensitivity derived from OGTT data and the euglycemic insulin clamp were compared by correlation analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration divided by the mean plasma insulin concentration during the OGTT displayed no correlation with the rate of whole-body <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal during the euglycemic insulin clamp (r = -0.02, NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>From the OGTT, we developed an index of whole-body insulin sensitivity (10,000/square root of [fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> x fasting insulin] x [mean <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> x mean insulin during OGTT]), which is highly correlated (r = 0.73, P &lt; 0.0001) with the rate of whole-body <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal during the euglycemic insulin clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Previous methods used to derive an index of insulin sensitivity from the OGTT have relied on the ratio of plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> to insulin concentration during the OGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate the limitations of such an approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We have derived a novel estimate of insulin sensitivity that is simple to calculate and provides a reasonable approximation of whole-body insulin sensitivity from the OGTT </plain></SENT>
