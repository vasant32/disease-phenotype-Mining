<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The New Zealand Paediatric Surveillance Unit sought monthly reporting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> cases from paediatricians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> resident children aged below 15 years (1996 census risk population 832,000) who met the criteria for diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> from 1 January 1999 to 31 December 2000 were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The average annual incidence of type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was calculated, as were incidence rates according to age, sex, region, ethnicity and season </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Case ascertainment was estimated using hospital admission data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 315 valid reports of new cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these, 298 (94.6%) had type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 12 (3.8%) had type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and five had other specified types of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The average annual incidence of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 17.9/100,000 (95% CI: 15.9-20/100,000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Children in the South Island had a 1.5-fold higher incidence than children in the North Island, which was largely accounted for by the variation in incidence with ethnicity, in that the European rate was 4.5 times higher than the Maori rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The average annual incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 0.84/100,000 (95% CI: 0.37-1.26/100,000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Estimated case ascertainment rate was 95.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence has doubled over the past three decades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The geographical differences previously described have persisted, and are largely explained by the ethnic variation in incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This population includes young adolescents with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These findings are in keeping with international trends </plain></SENT>
