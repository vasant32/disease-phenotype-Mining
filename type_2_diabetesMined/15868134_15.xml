<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genome-wide multipoint variance component linkage scans were carried out using 654 markers to identify quantitative trait loci for insulin sensitivity, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, disposition index and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> effectiveness training responses in whites and blacks in the HERITAGE Family Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: These phenotypes were obtained from an IVGTT with the minimal model </plain></SENT>
