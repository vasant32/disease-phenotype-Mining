<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a study comprising 519 unrelated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-tolerant subjects, we addressed the question as to whether the E23K variant was related to reduced serum insulin release during an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the polymorphism was examined in a case-control study comprising 803 type 2 diabetic patients and 862 glucose-tolerant control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The E23K variant was associated with significant reductions in the insulinogenic index (P = 0.022) and serum insulin levels under the response curve during an OGTT (0-120 min) (P = 0.014) as well as with an increase in BMI (P = 0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the association of the E23K polymorphism with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was not significant (P = 0.26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the K23K genotype significantly associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a meta-analysis of white case and control subjects (n = 2,824, odds ratio [OR] 1.49, P = 0.00022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the widespread E23K polymorphism may have a diabetogenic effect by impairing <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced insulin release and increasing BMI </plain></SENT>
