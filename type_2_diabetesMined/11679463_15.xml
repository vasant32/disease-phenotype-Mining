<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An important cause of elevated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels in elderly patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is an alteration in non-insulin-mediated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake (NIMGU) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> 1 (GLP-1) is an intestinal insulinotropic hormone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been proposed that this hormone also lowers <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels by enhancing NIMGU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to determine whether GLP-1 augments NIMGU in elderly patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, a group in which NIMGU is known to be impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Studies were conducted on 10 elderly patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (aged 75 +/- 2 years, BMI 27 +/- 1 kg/m(2)) who underwent paired 240-min <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> clamp studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In each study, octreotide was infused to suppress endogenous insulin release, and tritiated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> methodology was used to measure <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production and disposal rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For the first 180 min, no <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was infused </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>From 180 to 240 min, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was increased to 11 mmol/l using the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> clamp protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the GLP-1 study, GLP-1 was infused from 30 to 240 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In a subsequent control study, insulin was infused using the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> clamp protocol from 30 to 240 min to match the insulin levels that occurred during the GLP-1 infusion study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, GLP-1 enhanced <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal (control study: 2.52 +/- 0.19 mg x kg(-1) x min(-1); GLP-1 study: 2.90 +/- 0.17 mg x kg(-1) x min(-1); P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> output was not different between studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We conclude that GLP-1 may partially reverse the defect in NIMGU that occurs in elderly patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
