<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether waist circumference (WC), calf circumference (CC), and waist-to-calf ratio (WCR) are associated with carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was an observational study performed in 3,694 Korean patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anthropometric measures and carotid ultrasound were performed on each subject </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was defined as having a clearly isolated focal plaque or mean carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) â‰¥1.1 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CIMT and the frequency of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> were higher with increasing WC quartiles and decreasing CC quartiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was an augmentative effect of CC and WC on the frequency of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, which was dramatically higher in both the highest WC quartile and lowest CC quartile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, except for the relationship between the quartile of CC with the frequency of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in men, those associations disappeared after adjusting for potential confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, WCR was significantly related to CIMT (only in women) and carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, even after adjustment (adjusted odds ratio for carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> for the highest quartile of WCR compared with the lowest quartile being 1.178 [95% CI 1.026-1.353] and 1.276 [1.053-1.545] in men and women, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A low CC and high WC seems to be associated with a carotid atherosclerotic burden in Korean diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In particular, compared with each circumference, WCR is independently associated with carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the cross-sectional nature of the study limits conclusions regarding the direction or causality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further longitudinal study is warranted in this and other ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
