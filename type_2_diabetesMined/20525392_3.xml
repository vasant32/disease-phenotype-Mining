<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We examined the effects of the R325W mutation on the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the beta-cell-specific <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29105">Zn2+</z:chebi> (zinc) transporter ZnT-8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A model of the C-terminal domain of the human ZnT-8 protein was generated by homology modeling based on the known crystal structure of the Escherichia coli (E. coli) zinc transporter YiiP at 3.8 A resolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The homodimer ZnT-8 protein structure exists as a Y-shaped architecture with Arg325 located at the ultimate bottom of this motif at approximately 13.5 A from the transmembrane domain juncture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The C-terminal domain sequences of the human ZnT-8 protein and the E. coli zinc transporter YiiP share 12.3% identical and 39.5% homologous residues resulting in an overall homology of 51.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Validation statistics of the homology model showed a reasonable quality of the model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The C-terminal domain exhibited an alphabetabetaalphabeta fold with Arg325 as the penultimate <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33712">N-terminal residue</z:chebi> of the alpha2-helix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The side chains of both Arg325 and Trp325 point away from the interface with the other monomer, whereas the epsilon-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29421">NH3+</z:chebi> group of Arg325 is predicted to form an ionic interaction with the beta-COO- group of Asp326 as well as Asp295 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An amino acid alignment of the beta2-alpha2 C-terminal loop domain revealed a variety of neutral amino acids at position 325 of different ZnT-8 proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our validated homology models predict that both Arg325 and Trp325, amino acids with a helix-forming behavior, and penultimate <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33712">N-terminal residues</z:chebi> in the alpha2-helix of the C-terminal domain, are shielded by the planar surface of the three cytoplasmic beta-strands and hence unable to affect the sensing capacity of the C-terminal domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the amino acid residue at position 325 is too far removed from the docking and transporter parts of ZnT-8 to affect their local protein conformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that the inherited R325W abnormality in SLC30A8 may be tolerated and results in adequate zinc transfer to the correct sites in the pancreatic islet cells and are consistent with the observation that the SLC30A8 gene variant R325W has a low predicted value for future type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at population-based level </plain></SENT>
