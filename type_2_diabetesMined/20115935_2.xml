<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have retrospectively analyzed the incidence of CIN developed after PCI in 151 patients T2DM and 50 patients without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were subjected to thorough clinical examination (including serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> level before and 48 hours after intervention) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CIN developed more frequently after PCI in patients with T2DM than in patients of the same age without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at the same baseline renal function, volume of contrast media and hydration status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The risk of developing CIN in patients with T2DM is associated with: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, volume of contrast media, <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretics</z:chebi> use in the peri-procedure period, multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, need of interventional procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TIDM patients with CIN had faster decline of renal function, more often developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> and had lower 24 month survival rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High risk of CIN development and its prognostic significance in patients with T2DM determine the necessity of individually evaluated risks for preventive measures during contrast media interventions </plain></SENT>
