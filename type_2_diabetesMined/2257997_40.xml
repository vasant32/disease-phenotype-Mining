<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine whether these markedly different results could be due to the mode of priming: fixed or adjusted, or the mode of calculation: steady state or non-steady state equations, we studied 11 patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> 8-20 mmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For 6 h 3-3H-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (0.40 microCi/min) was infused preceded by a priming dose of 40 microCi (fixed priming), or 40 microCi.plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (mmol/l).5(-1) (adjusted priming) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In diabetic patients the plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration was not constant but declined 0.52 +/- 0.07 mmol.l-1.h-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the rate of fall was correlated to the fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration (r = 0.90, p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, the fasting state was not a steady state condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using adjusted priming a constant tracer steady state level was obtained within 60 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, using fixed priming tracer steady state was not reached within 6 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The initial tracer level was far below, and increased in time towards the steady state level observed after adjusted priming </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Consequently, using Steele's equations after fixed priming, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production rates calculated after 90-120 min were overestimated in proportion to fasting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion: The fasting state in patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is not a steady state condition </plain></SENT>
