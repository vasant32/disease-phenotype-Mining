<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that there are sex-specific differences in glucometabolic control, and in social and psychological factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also examined the influence of these factors on glucometabolic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined 257 (126 men/131 women) consecutive patients (64 +/- 9 years, means +/- SD) of a metropolitan <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> outpatient service employing clinical testing and standardised psychological questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean HbA(1c) (7.6 +/- 1.2%) was not different between women and men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Women patients on oral hypoglycaemic agents were better informed about <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (p = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They employed more strategies for coping with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, including religion (p = 0.0001), active coping (p = 0.048) and distraction (p = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Women reported lower satisfaction with social support (p = 0.034), but not more <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> than men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although no differences were observed in compliance, insulin-treated patients were more satisfied with their therapy (p = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Variables predicting poor metabolic control were different in men (R(2) = 0.737, p = 0.012) and women (R(2) = 0.597, p = 0.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Major predictors of high HbA(1c) included depressive coping, lower sexual desire, quality of life and internal locus of control, but high external doctor-related locus of control in women and frequent emotional experiences of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Lower quality of life, internal control and socioeconomic status, and higher prevalence of negative emotions probably prevented woman patients from achieving improved <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control despite their better knowledge of and greater efforts to cope with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We suggest that women patients would benefit from individualised <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care offering social support, whereas men would benefit from knowledge-based <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> management giving them more informational and instrumental support </plain></SENT>
