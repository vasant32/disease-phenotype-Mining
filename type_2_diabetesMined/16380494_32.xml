<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have tested the hypothesis that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> singly or combined may increase tissue factor, the primary initiator of blood coagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have determined changes in circulating tissue factor procoagulant activity (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) and other procoagulation proteins in healthy volunteers exposed to 24 h of selective <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo>, selective <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, or combined <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Combined elevations of plasma insulin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels for 24 h produced a ninefold increase in tissue factor <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>, which was associated with an increase in monocyte tissue factor protein (flow cytometry) and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> (RT-PCR), increases in plasma thrombin-antithrombin complexes, prothrombin fragment 1.2, factor VIII coagulant activity, and platelet CD40 ligand as well as decreases in factor VIIa, factor VII coagulant activities, and factor VII antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Effects of selective <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> and selective <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> were less striking but appeared to be additive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> but particularly the combination of both create a prothrombotic state and in addition may be proinflammatory and proatherogenic because of the proinflammatory actions of CD40 ligand and tissue factor </plain></SENT>
