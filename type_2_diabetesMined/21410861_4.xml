<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Given that insulin influences endothelial biology, we compared the effects of add-on basal insulin analogues on endothelial damage and regeneration in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2D) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a 6-month randomized crossover trial comparing add-on insulin detemir versus glargine in poorly controlled T2D with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096293" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">macroangiopathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At baseline, crossover (3 months) and study end (6 months), we measured HbA1c, EPCs, circulating endothelial cells (CECs), VCAM-1, ICAM-1 and E-selectin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Body weight and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0745153" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemic episodes</z:e> were also recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-two patients completed the study, randomly assigned to the glargine-detemir (n = 21) or the detemir-glargine (n = 21) schedule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At crossover, EPC levels did not change compared with baseline, but significantly increased at study end </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CECs decreased over time and were significantly reduced at study end </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and E-selectin were significantly reduced at crossover and further decreased at study end </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No differences were seen in these effects between detemir and glargine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>HbA1c showed a carryover effect and its reduction was similar with detemir and glargine in the first arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> was lower with detemir than with glargine in both arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Optimized glycaemic control by add-on basal insulin improved indexes of endothelial damage and regeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Compared to glargine, detemir achieved similar endothelial protection with lower <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> and less <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These results might have implications for therapy of aging T2D patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
