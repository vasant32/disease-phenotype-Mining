<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 59 overweight or <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were randomly assigned to either a combination therapy <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> program for 2 years (C therapy) or a standard therapy <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> program for 1 year followed by a combination therapy <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> program in the 2nd year (S/C therapy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>C therapy combined the use of meal replacement products, repetitive intermittent low-calorie-diet weeks, and pharmacologic therapy with sibutramine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Outcome measures included changes in weight, glycemic control, plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, blood pressure, and body composition over 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 48 participants (23 in the C therapy group and 25 in the S/C therapy group) completed 2 years of study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 2 years, the C therapy group had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> of 4.6 +/- 1.2 kg (P &lt; 0.001) and a decrease in HbA(1c) of 0.5 +/- 0.3% (P = 0.08) from baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 2 years, the C therapy group had significant reductions in BMI, fat mass, lean body mass, and systolic blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The S/C therapy group showed changes in weight and HbA(1c) in year 2 of the study that were similar to those demonstrated by the C therapy group in year 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This combination <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> program resulted in significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and improved <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> control over a 2-year period in overweight subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
