<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Although there is consensus that excess <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> is strongly associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, its relationship with weight change is less clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigates the relative impact of BMI at baseline and short-term (2- or 3-year) weight changes on the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Prospective data were collected from a population-based cohort of middle-aged women participating in the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health (n = 7,239 for this report) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To date, participants have completed four mailed surveys (S1, 1996; S2, 1998; S3, 2001; and S4, 2004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Generalized estimating equations were used to model binary repeated-measures data to assess the impact of BMI at S1 and weight change (S1 to S2; S2 to S3) on 3-year incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at S3 and S4, respectively, adjusting for sociodemographic and lifestyle factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BMI at S1 was strongly associated with the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by S3 or S4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with women who had a BMI &lt;25 kg/m2, those with BMI &gt; or =25 kg/m2 had higher incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P &lt; 0.0001), with odd ratios reaching 12.1 (95% CI 7.6-19.3) for women in the very <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> group (BMI &gt; or =35 kg/m2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no association between shorter-term <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> on first-reported diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P = 0.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Because women's risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in midlife is more closely related to their initial BMI (when aged 45-50 years) than to subsequent short-term weight change, public health initiatives should target the prevention of <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> before and during early adulthood </plain></SENT>
