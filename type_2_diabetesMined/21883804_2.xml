<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In recent years, the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) has emerged as a principal site of insulin action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This notion is supported by studies in animals relying on intracerebroventricular insulin infusion and by experiments in humans that make use of the intranasal pathway of insulin administration to the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Employing neurobehavioural and metabolic measurements as well as functional imaging techniques, these studies have provided insight into a broad range of central and peripheral effects of brain insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present review focuses on <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> effects of insulin administered via the intranasal route on cognition, in particular memory function, and whole-body energy homeostasis including <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, evidence is reviewed that suggests a pathophysiological role of impaired brain insulin signaling in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, which are hallmarked by peripheral and possibly central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, as well as in conditions such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> where <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> might contribute to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
