<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 521 patients aged 27-76 years with a mean baseline HbA(1c) of 8.1% were randomised in a 1:2:2 ratio to treatment with placebo, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> 100 mg once daily, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> 200 mg once daily, for 18 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The efficacy analysis was based on an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-patients-treated population using an analysis of covariance, excluding data obtained after glycaemic rescue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 18 weeks, HbA(1c) was significantly reduced with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> 100 mg and 200 mg compared with placebo (placebo-subtracted HbA(1c) reduction: -0.60% and -0.48%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">Sitagliptin</z:chebi> also significantly decreased fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> relative to placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with higher baseline HbA(1c) (&gt; or =9%) experienced greater placebo-subtracted HbA(1c) reductions with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> (-1.20% for 100 mg and -1.04% for 200 mg) than those with HbA(1c) &lt;8% (-0.44% and -0.33%, respectively) or &gt; or =8% to 8.9% (-0.61% and -0.39%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Homeostasis model assessment beta cell function index and fasting proinsulin:insulin ratio, markers of insulin secretion and beta cell function, were significantly improved with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> and gastrointestinal adverse experiences was not significantly different between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> and placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">Sitagliptin</z:chebi> had a neutral effect on body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">Sitagliptin</z:chebi> significantly improved glycaemic control and was well tolerated in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> who had inadequate glycaemic control on exercise and diet </plain></SENT>
