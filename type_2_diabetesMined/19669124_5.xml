<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In Danes we aimed to examine rs560887 in relation to plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and serum insulin responses following oral and i.v. <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> loads and in relation to hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production during a hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we examined rs560887 for association with impaired fasting glycaemia (IFG), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT), type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and components of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: rs560887 was genotyped in the Inter99 cohort (n = 5,899), in 366 young, healthy Danes, in non-diabetic relatives of type 2 diabetic patients (n = 196), and in young and elderly twins (n = 159) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Participants underwent an OGTT, an IVGTT or a 2 h hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The rs560887 G allele associated with elevated fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (p = 2 x 10(-14)) but not with plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels at 30 min (p = 0.9) or 120 min (p = 0.9) during an OGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>G allele carriers had elevated levels of serum insulin at 30 min during an OGTT (p = 1 x 10(-4)) and relatives of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients carrying the G allele had an increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin response (p = 4 x 10(-4)) during an IVGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among elderly twins, G allele carriers had higher basal hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production (p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, the G allele associated with the risk of having IFG (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.08-1.47, p = 0.002), but not with IGT (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.82-1.08, p = 0.4) or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.84-1.04, p = 0.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The common rs560887 G allele in the G6PC2/ABCB11 locus is associated with increased fasting glycaemia and increased risk of IFG, associations that may be partly related to an increased basal hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production rate </plain></SENT>
