<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> administration were investigated using working hearts isolated from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rat or rats diabetic for 4 weeks after <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> (STZ) injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hearts were subjected to 30 min of normothermic, zero-flow <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> followed by 30-min reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">Rosiglitazone</z:chebi> (1 micromol/l) administered before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> had no effect on cardiac function during baseline perfusion, but it significantly improved aortic flow during reperfusion in both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and diabetic hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> protocol in which <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> was given by daily gavage (10 micromol/kg body wt) immediately after STZ injection, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> also prevented postischemic injury and significantly improved functional recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using Western immunoblotting, it was demonstrated that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cardioprotective effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> is associated with an inhibition of Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase phosphorylation in both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and diabetic rat hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> also inhibited activating protein-1 DNA-binding activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data, demonstrating that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> limits postischemic injury in isolated hearts, suggest an important function for PPAR-gamma in the heart </plain></SENT>
