<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have generated transgenic mice overexpressing the human GPR40 gene (hGPR40-Tg) under control of the mouse insulin II promoter and have used them to examine the role of GPR40 in the regulation of insulin secretion and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Research Design and Methods: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> (C57BL/6J) and diabetic (KK) mice overexpressing the human GPR40 gene under control of the insulin II promoter were generated, and their <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism and islet function were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results: In comparison with nontransgenic littermates, hGPR40-Tg mice exhibited improved oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance with an increase in insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although islet morphological analysis showed no obvious differences between hGPR40-Tg and nontransgenic (NonTg) mice, isolated islets from hGPR40-Tg mice enhanced insulin secretion in response to high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (16 mM) than those from NonTg mice with unchanged low <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (3 mM)-stimulated insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, hGPR40-Tg islets significantly <z:mp ids='MP_0003058'>increased insulin secretion</z:mp> against a naturally occurring <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> in the presence of 11 mM <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>hGPR40-Tg mice were also found to be resistant to high fat diet-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo>, and hGPR40-Tg harboring KK mice showed augmented insulin secretion and improved oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance compared to nontransgenic littermates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: Our results suggest that GPR40 may have a role in regulating <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion and plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels in vivo, and that pharmacological activation of GPR40 may provide a novel insulin secretagogue beneficial for the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
