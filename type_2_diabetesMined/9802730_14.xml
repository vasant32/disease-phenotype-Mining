<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Prior studies have supported that waist circumference correlates better with visceral adipose tissue and is a better predictor of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> than are BMI and waist-to-hip ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we reexamine the role of waist size on the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in African-origin populations from three contrasting environments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted of 5,042 men and women 25-74 years of age from Nigeria, Jamaica, and the U.S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The relationship between waist, blood pressure, and fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was assessed using multiple linear regression analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analyses using sex-specific empirical waist cut-points were used to determine the risks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Waist circumference was positively correlated with blood pressure and fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increasing waist quartiles were significantly associated with higher risks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in the three populations, as estimated from age-adjusted odds ratios obtained from sex-specific logistic regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A highly elevated risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-10-fold for Jamaican men and 23-fold for African-American women-was observed in the comparison of lowest to highest quartiles of waist circumference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Substantial reduction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in men and women is achievable if the waist size is decreased in these populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intervention programs designed to reduce waist circumference through lifestyle modification, including exercise and diet, may have significant public health significance in reducing the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult-onset</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in these populations </plain></SENT>
