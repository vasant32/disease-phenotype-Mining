<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As a central enzyme in lipogenesis, the gene encoding fatty acid synthase (FASN) was identified as a candidate gene for determining body fat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study we tested the hypothesis that increased FASN expression links metabolic alterations of excess energy intake, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020459" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperinsulinaemia</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidaemia</z:e> and altered adipokine profile to increased body fat mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In paired samples of visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue from 196 participants (lean or <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>), we investigated whether FASN <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression (assessed by PCR) in adipose tissue is increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and related to visceral fat accumulation, measures of insulin sensitivity (euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp) and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: FASN <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was increased by 1.7-fold in visceral vs subcutaneous fat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Visceral adipose tissue FASN expression was correlated with FASN protein levels, subcutaneous FASN expression, visceral fat area, fasting plasma insulin, serum concentrations of IL-6, leptin and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50211">retinol</z:chebi>-binding protein 4 (RBP4), and inversely with measures of insulin sensitivity, independently of age, sex and BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we found significant correlations between FASN expression and markers of renal function, including serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> and urinary albumin excretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Increased FASN gene expression in adipose tissue is linked to visceral fat accumulation, impaired insulin sensitivity, increased circulating fasting insulin, IL-6, leptin and RBP4, suggesting an important role of lipogenic pathways in the causal relationship between consequences of excess energy intake and the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
