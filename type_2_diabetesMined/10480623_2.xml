<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IRS-2-deficient mice display <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> characteristics of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, suggesting that dysfunction of the IRS-2 gene may contribute to the pathogenesis of human type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on its <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> inducibility, we have recently cloned and sequenced a full-length human IRS-2 cDNA containing an open reading frame (ORF) of 4,014 bp and 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions (UTRs) of 516 and 2,466 bp (5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although the IRS-2 gene has previously been thought to lack introns within the coding region (6,7), the amino acid sequence predicted from our cDNA sequence differed at its very COOH-terminal end from an IRS-2 protein sequence derived from genomic IRS-2 sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we carefully analyzed the genomic structure of the IRS-2 gene and found that the IRS-2 gene contains an intron that disrupts the ORF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Characterization of promoter and 5'-flanking regions of IRS-2 by sequencing, reporter gene assays, and chromatin structure analysis suggests that elements conferring <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> inducibility are not located immediately upstream of the gene promoter </plain></SENT>
