<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixty-one patients over 65 years of age with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 53 age- and sex-matched non-diabetic controls were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hippocampal and whole brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophies</z:mpath> were assessed by quantifying hippocampal and brain volumes by brain magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cognitive function was evaluated by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Revised Hasegawa <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Scale (HDS-R) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with the non-diabetic group, patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> showed significant increases in hippocampal and whole brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophies</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The MMSE and HDS-R scores in type 2 diabetic patients showed significant negative correlations with age and significant positive correlations with years of education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These scores were also significantly negatively correlated with hippocampal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, but not whole brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hippocampal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> in diabetic patients did not, however, correlate with age, years of education, or <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We showed hippocampal and whole brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophies</z:mpath> to be more frequent in elderly patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than in non-diabetic controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Their cognitive functions were significantly and negatively associated with hippocampal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
