<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that impaired processing of the IAPP precursor proIAPP contributes to amyloid formation and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>GH3 cells lacking the prohormone convertase 1/3 (PC1/3) and IAPP and with very low levels of prohormone convertase 2 (PC2) were transduced with adenovirus (Ad) expressing human or rat (control) proIAPP linked to green fluorescent protein, with or without Ad-PC2 or Ad-PC1/3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression of human proIAPP increased the number of transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick-end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells 96 h after transduction (+hIAPP 8.7 +/- 0.4% vs. control 3.0 +/- 0.4%; P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>COOH-terminal processing of human proIAPP by PC1/3 increased (hIAPP+PC1/3 10.4 +/- 0.7%; P &lt; 0.05), whereas NH(2)-terminal processing of proIAPP by addition of PC2 markedly decreased (hIAPP+PC2 5.5 +/- 0.5%; P &lt; 0.05) the number of apoptotic GH3 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Islets from mice lacking PC2 and with beta-cell expression of human proIAPP (hIAPP(+/+)/PC2(-/-)) developed amyloid associated with beta-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> during 2-week culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rescue of PC2 expression by ex vivo transduction with Ad-PC2 restored NH(2)-terminal processing to mature IAPP and decreased both the extent of amyloid formation and the number of TUNEL-positive cells (-PC2 26.5 +/- 4.1% vs. +PC2 16.1 +/- 4.3%; P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that impaired NH(2)-terminal processing of proIAPP leads to amyloid formation and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and that accumulation of the NH(2)-terminally extended human proIAPP intermediate may be a critical initiating step in amyloid formation </plain></SENT>
