<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cross-sectional ecological study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Questionnaires were developed and administered to patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and their first degree relatives in both Bahrain and Ireland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data was analysed using non-parametric tests of association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Responses were compared between 297 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from Ireland and 201 from Bahrain and between 364 relatives of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Ireland and 244 from Bahrain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Relatives in Bahrain had more knowledge of risk factors for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and an increased perception of the seriousness of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> but a more external, chance locus of control and perceived more barriers to changing lifestyles than those in Ireland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in perception of personal risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of risk factors and seriousness of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are higher in Bahrain than in Ireland but perception of personal risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and intention to adopt risk reducing behaviours are no different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There is a need to develop models of behavioural change that are more relevant to the needs of the Bahraini population in reducing their risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
