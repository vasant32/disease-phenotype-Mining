<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-six patients inadequately controlled on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi>/meglitinide were randomized to receive add-on therapy with insulin glargine or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> for 26 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Insulin was up-titrated to achieve fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &lt;6 mmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">Pioglitazone</z:chebi> was increased to 45 mg/day after 16 weeks if HbA1c&gt;6.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>beta-Cell function and insulin sensitivity were assessed by measuring insulin, proinsulin and adiponectin, and in a subgroup using a combined glucagon-stimulated C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> test and insulin tolerance test (GITT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">Lipids</z:chebi> and natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> were measured at start and end of study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The reduction in HbA1c was slightly greater in the insulin glargine group and used as co-variate when analysing other variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The effect on beta-cell function was more favourable with insulin glargine measured by proinsulin (42+/-48 to 19+/-16, p=0.01 vs. 36+/-26 to 27+/-16 p=0.04) while the improvement in insulin sensitivity measured by adiponectin (7.5+/-3.7 to 15+/-10, p&lt;0.01 vs. 8.7+/-4 to 7.6+/-3, p=0.04) and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (1.10+/-0.24 to 1.24+/-0.3, p&lt;0.01 vs. 1.08+/-0.35 to 1.04+/-0.33, ns) (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p between groups &lt;0.01) was more favourable in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">Pioglitazone</z:chebi> caused significant increase in natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> (BNP pmol/l 6.6+/-5.2 to 13.7+/-16.1, p=0.04 vs. 8.8+/-11.6 to 8.6+/-10.6, ns, p between groups 0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate characteristic differences in the effects of insulin glargine vs. <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> on measures of beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity as well as cardiac load </plain></SENT>
