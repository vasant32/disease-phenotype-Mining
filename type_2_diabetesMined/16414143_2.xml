<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="2668">Amlodipine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8774">ramipril</z:chebi> were added to their previous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> treatment for 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Urinary TGF-beta1 (UTGF-beta1) was determined at 0, 4, 8 and 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma TGF-beta1 was determined at 0 and 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects whose mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) during treatment were under 140 mmHg were grouped as the better SBP controlled group (n = 11) and those with SBP equal to or greater than 140 mHg were grouped in a moderate SBP controlled group (n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared to baseline, mean log UTGF-beta1 at 4, 8 and 12 weeks decreased (-0.22 +/- 0.15 pg/mg; p = 0.04) in better SBP controlled group but not in the moderate SBP controlled group (-0.12 +/- 0.08 pg/mg, p = 0.82) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean SBP correlated with UTGF-beta1 (r = 0.458, p = 0.0357), and this effect was independent of HbA1c (p = 0.042) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By controlling SBP in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DM2</z:e> subjects with DN we might decrease UTGF-beta1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We propose that reduction of UTGF-beta1 is due to a decrease in renal TGF-beta1 production </plain></SENT>
