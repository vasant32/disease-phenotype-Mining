<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Slides were prepared for light microscopic reading by uniform histologic techniques, and then were randomly intermixed and coded with tissues identically prepared from matched non-diabetic subjects (morphologic controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After independent review by three morphologists, the results were tabulated and assigned to one of four diagnostic groups: 1) typical diabetic nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000096'>glomerulosclerosis</z:hpo>; 2) mesangial changes suggestive of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (diffuse lesion); 3) non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011881" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic renal disease</z:e>; 4) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> for age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the diabetic cases 31% (17 of 55) were found to show nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000096'>glomerulosclerosis</z:hpo>, and another 47% (26 of 55) showed suggestive changes; none of the morphologic control slides was read as showing nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000096'>glomerulosclerosis</z:hpo>, but some were judged to show suggestive mesangial (diffuse) changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although only 4 of the 17 diabetic patients with nodules had died of <z:mp ids='MP_0009644'>uraemia</z:mp>, many had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, which may have contributed to their <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients with nodular glomerular changes also showed, on the average, the highest blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels during life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in later life appears to be associated with a high risk for typical tissue changes of diabetic kidney damage, which may contribute significantly to morbidity and mortality and may be present before <z:hpo ids='HP_0002157'>azotaemia</z:hpo> and qualitative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> have been recognized </plain></SENT>
