<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This analysis was part of a 24-week trial, in which 964 insulin-naive patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> inadequately controlled on oral agents (including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>) were randomized to insulin glargine or detemir </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Secretagogues were stopped or maintained at the site-investigators' discretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the study, 57.6% of patients continued their secretagogue treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with patients stopping secretagogues, those who continued experienced significantly more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Insulin doses, however, were significantly lower: 0.6 ± 0.4 versus 0.8 ± 0.4 U/kg/day (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The difference between groups in mean HbA1c reduction was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, in type 2 diabetic patients starting basal insulin analogue therapy, continuing both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and secretagogues results in more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> and lower insulin doses than only maintaining <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
