<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Elderly patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were randomly treated in a double-blind fashion with placebo (n = 23) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> (n = 22) for 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Before and after randomization, subjects underwent a meal tolerance test and a hyperglycemic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> clamp study designed to measure insulin release and sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 12 months of therapy there was a significant difference in the change in fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels (0.2 +/- 0.3 vs. -0.5 +/- 0.2 mmol/l, placebo vs. <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> group, respectively; P &lt; 0.05) and in incremental postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> values (-0.4 +/- 0.6 vs. -3.5 +/- 0.6 mmol/l, placebo vs. <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> group, P &lt; 0.001) between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a significant difference in the change in HbA(1c) values in response to treatment (0.4 +/- 0.2 vs. -0.4 +/- 0.1%, placebo vs. <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> group, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The change in fasting insulin in response to treatment (-2 +/- 2 vs. -13 +/- 4 pmol/l, placebo vs. <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> group, P &lt; 0.05) and incremental postprandial insulin responses (-89 +/- 26 vs. -271 +/- 59 pmol/l, placebo vs. <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> group, P &lt; 0.01) was also significantly different between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the hyperglycemic clamps, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin values were similar in both groups before and after therapy However, there was a significant difference in the change in insulin sensitivity in response to treatment between the placebo and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> groups (0.001 +/- 0.001 vs. 0.004 +/- 0.001 mg/kg x min(-1) [pmol/l](-1), respectively, P &lt; 0.05) CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">Acarbose</z:chebi> increases insulin sensitivity but not insulin release in elderly patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
