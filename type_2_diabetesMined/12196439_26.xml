<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Subjects were 32 children aged 8-13 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Visceral fat and subcutaneous abdominal fat were determined by magnetic resonance imaging at the umbilicus and total body fat was determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity (S(i)) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin response (AIR) were determined by frequently sampled intravenous tolerance test with minimal modeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin, S(i), and AIR (+/- SD) were 5.3 +/- 0.3 mmol/l, 206 +/- 105 pmol/l, 11.8 +/- 5.7 [x 10(-4) min(-1)/(pmol/l)], and 17,175 +/- 9,695 (pmol/l x 10 min), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In multivariate regression analysis, total fat mass was independently and positively related to fasting insulin (P &lt; 0.01) and negatively related to S(i) (P &lt; 0.05) but was not related to AIR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Visceral fat was independently and positively related to fasting insulin (P &lt; 0.05) and AIR (P &lt; 0.01) and negatively related to S(i) (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: -These findings support the hypothesis that specific accumulation of visceral fat in addition to overall <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> in Hispanic children increases the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
