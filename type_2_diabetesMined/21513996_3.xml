<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine iron regulator hepcidin and iron metabolic parameters in Type 2 DM patients, the relationships among them were evaluated in this specific sub-groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included sixty-four people: 34 cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 30 age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum hepcidin, IL-6, hsCRP, ferritin, sTfR, EPO as well as other clinical parameters were detected, and the associations between hepcidin levels and iron/inflammatory parameters were analyzed in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum ferritin and hepcidin levels in diabetic patients were significant higher than the controls (p&lt;0.001 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A positive correlation between hepcidin and ferritin, as well as between ferritin and IL-6 levels was existed in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the control groups (p&lt;0.001 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of these data demonstrated that the higher hepcidin levels in diabetic patients may be due to those higher ferritin and IL-6 levels, the elevated hepcidin might have adaptive value through down-regulated iron absorb and play an important role in pathogenesis of Type 2 DM </plain></SENT>
