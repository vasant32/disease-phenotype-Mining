<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a randomized, 12-week, open-label study comparing vildagliptin (100 mg, n = 1653) and TZD (agent and dose at the investigators' discretion, n = 825) add-on therapy in patients inadequately controlled [<z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1C) (HbA(1c)): 7-10%] on a stable dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (&gt; or =1000 mg/day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary objective was to test non-inferiority of vildagliptin to TZDs for the difference in change in HbA(1c) from baseline [established if the upper limit of the two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CI) did not exceed 0.4%] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean (+/- s.e.) change in HbA(1c) from baseline to study endpoint was -0.68 +/- 0.02% in the vildagliptin group and -0.57 +/- 0.03% in the TZD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The difference between groups was -0.11% (95% CI: -0.17% and -0.04%), establishing the non-inferiority of vildagliptin (p = 0.001) after 3 months of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vildagliptin was non-inferior to TZDs for subgroups of race, age and body mass index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Body weight increased in the TZD group (0.33 +/- 0.11 kg) and decreased in the vildagliptin group (mean: -0.58 +/- 0.09 kg; p &lt; 0.001 for difference) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adverse events occurred in similar proportions of patients in both groups (vildagliptin: 39.5% and TZD: 36.3%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hypoglycaemia</z:e> and abnormal changes in liver enzymes were uncommon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This short-term study suggests that vildagliptin is as effective as TZDs after 3-month treatment as an add-on to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> in a primary care population that included diverse patient subgroups </plain></SENT>
