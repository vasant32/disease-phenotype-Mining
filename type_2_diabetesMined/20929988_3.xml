<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of adding pharmacists to primary care teams on the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled trial with blinded ascertainment of outcomes within primary care clinics in Edmonton, Canada </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pharmacists performed medication assessments and limited history and physical examinations and provided guideline-concordant recommendations to optimize medication management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Follow-up contact was completed as necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Control patients received usual care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was a â‰¥10% decrease in systolic blood pressure at 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 260 patients were enrolled, 57% were women, the mean age was 59 years, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration was 6 years, and blood pressure was 129/74 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight of 131 (37%) intervention patients and 30 of 129 (23%) control patients achieved the primary outcome (odds ratio 1.9 [95% CI 1.1-3.3]; P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among 153 patients with inadequately controlled <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> at baseline, intervention patients (n = 82) were significantly more likely than control patients (n = 71) to achieve the primary outcome (41 [50%] vs. 20 [28%]; 2.6 [1.3-5.0]; P = 0.007) and recommended blood pressure targets (44 [54%] vs. 21 [30%]; 2.8 [1.4-5.4]; P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 10-year risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, based on changes to the UK Prospective <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study Risk Engine, were predicted to decrease by 3% for intervention patients and 1% for control patients (P = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Significantly more patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> achieved better blood pressure control when pharmacists were added to primary care teams, which suggests that pharmacists can make important contributions to the primary care of these patients </plain></SENT>
