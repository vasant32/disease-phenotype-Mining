<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of these, 68 participants had type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at baseline, and 54 and 57 had incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at the 6- and 12-year follow-up, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Changes in performance on tests of information-processing speed, executive function, and verbal memory from baseline to 6- and 12-year follow-up were compared between groups using linear mixed models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Effects of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> were adjusted for demographic variables, history of smoking, alcohol intake, and comorbid conditions, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, BMI, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>.RESULTSParticipants with baseline <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> showed larger decline in information-processing speed (estimate -7.64; P &lt; 0.01), executive function (21.82; P &lt; 0.01), and delayed word recall (-1.35; P &lt; 0.05) over the 12-year follow-up compared with control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant difference in decline was observed for immediate word recall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with control subjects, participants with incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> showed subtle early decline in information-processing speed only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, they did not show larger decline in any other cognitive domain.CONCLUSIONSIndividuals with baseline type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> show accelerated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo>, particularly in information-processing speed and executive function, compared with individuals without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, decline in speed becomes detectable first, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> seems to increase with increasing exposure time </plain></SENT>
