<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The relative contribution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> and physical inactivity to the risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We prospectively examined the individual and joint association of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and physical activity with the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in 68,907 female nurses who had no history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Adiposity</z:e> was measured by BMI and waist circumference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Physical activity was assessed through average hours of moderate or vigorous exercise and computation of an MET score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We documented 4,030 incident cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during 16 years of follow-up (from 1986 to 2002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate model including age, smoking, and other <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk factors, risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> increased progressively with increasing BMI (P &lt; 0.001) and waist circumference (P &lt; 0.001) and with decreasing physical activity levels (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In joint analyses of BMI and physical activity, using women who had a healthy weight (BMI &lt; 25 kg/m(2)) and were physically active (exercise &gt; or = 21.8 MET h/week) as the reference group, the relative risks of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were 16.75 (95% CI 13.99-20.04) for women who were <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (BMI &gt; or = 30 kg/m(2)) and inactive (exercise &lt; 2.1 MET h/week), 10.74 (8.74-13.18) for women who were active but <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, and 2.08 (1.66-2.61) for women who were lean but inactive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In combined analyses of waist circumference and physical activity, both variables were significant predictors of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but the association for waist circumference was substantially stronger than that for physical inactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> and physical inactivity independently contribute to the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; however, the magnitude of risk contributed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> is much greater than that imparted by lack of physical activity </plain></SENT>
