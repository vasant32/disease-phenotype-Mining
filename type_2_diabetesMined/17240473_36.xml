<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cross-sectional studies suggest that attainment of HbA1c goals requires specific targeting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011998'>postprandial hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We undertook a prospective intervention trial to assess the relative contribution of controlling FPG and <z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi> for achieving recommended HbA1c goals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hundred and sixty-four patients (90 male and 74 female) with unsatisfactory glycemic control (HbA1c &gt;/=7.5%) were enrolled in an individualized forced titration intensified treatment program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 3 months HbA1c levels decreased from 8.7+/-0.1 to 6.5+/-0.1% (p&lt;0.001); FPG decreased from 174+/-4 to 117+/-2mg/dl (p&lt;0.001); <z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi> decreased from 224+/-4 to 159+/-3mg/dl (p&lt;0.001) and daylong <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> (average of premeal, postprandial and bedtime plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excluding FPG) decreased from 199+/-4 to 141+/-2mg/dl (p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients' weight remained unchanged (84.0+/-1.4kg versus 82.9+/-1.5kg, p=0.36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only 64% of patients achieving FPG targets of &lt;100mg/dl achieved an HbA1c target of &lt;7% whereas 94% of patients achieving the postprandial target of &lt;140mg/dl did </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Decreases in <z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi> accounted for nearly twice as much for the decreases in HbA1c as did decreases in FPG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi> accounted approximately 80% of HbA1c when HbA1c was &lt;6.2% and only about 40% when HbA1c was above 9.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Control of fasting <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> is necessary but usually insufficient for achieving HbA1c goals &lt;7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Control of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011998'>postprandial hyperglycemia</z:hpo> is essential for achieving recommended HbA1c goals </plain></SENT>
