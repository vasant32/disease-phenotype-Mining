<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous association studies and high allelic frequency suggest this effect to critically inhibit secretion and play a major role in pathogenesis of common type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on evidence for functional relevance of E23K in both the heterozygous (E/K; with E in position 23 of K(IR)6.2 in one allele and K in the other) and homozygous (K/K; with K in position 23 of K(IR)6.2 in both alleles) genotype, we propose a model in which enhanced susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is associated with evolutionary advantage of the E/K state </plain></SENT>
