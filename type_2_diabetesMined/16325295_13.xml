<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To examine the effects of CYP2C9 genetic polymorphisms on the safety and efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the responses to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> were measured in Japanese type 2 diabetic patients with the different CYP2C9 genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The reduction in the HbA(1c) was significantly larger (P&lt;0.05) among the CYP2C9*1/*3 subjects than among the CYP2C9*1/*1 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The long-term observations of 2 patients with a CYP2C9*1/*3 suggested that subjects with a CYP2C9*1/*3 respond well to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> during the initial phase of treatment, but 1 patient have shown the <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> over the long-term treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The pharmacokinetic study showed that the area under the concentration-time curve for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> in the CYP2C9*1/*3 subjects was approximately 2.5-fold higher than that of the CYP2C9*1/*1 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The intrinsic clearance of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> by the CYP2C9*3 enzyme was lower than that by the CYP2C9*1 enzyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that the lower hydroxylation activity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> in the subject with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and CYP2C9*1/*3 led to a marked elevation in the plasma concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> and a stronger pharmacological effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
