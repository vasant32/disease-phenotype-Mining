<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data from study participants, 127 nondiabetic African-Americans (mean age 32 +/- 4 years), included anthropometric measurements, an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT), a 2-h euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp, and a fasting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity to insulin as a glucoregulatory hormone was determined by M/FFM, where M is the mean <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion rate during the second hour of the clamp and FFM is fat-free mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity to insulin's antilipolytic action was assessed during the OGTT by the percent suppression of free fatty acid (FFA) concentrations between 0 and 120 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The higher the suppression of FFAs, the greater the sensitivity to insulin's antilipolytic action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The participants were classified by BMI into three groups: nonobese (31 men, 24 women), <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (17 men, 14 women), and severely <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (12 men, 29 women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The women had higher percentages of body fat (P &lt; 0.001), and the men had greater FFM (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The M/FFM values for men versus women in each BMI group were nonobese, 8.8 +/- 2.8 vs. 10.8 +/- 4.4; <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, 7.2 +/- 3.4 vs. 8.5 +/- 3.4; and severely <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, 4.7 +/- 2.1 vs. 6.1 +/- 2.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The difference between the BMI groups was significant (P &lt; 0.001), as was the difference between men and women (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, there was a significant sex difference in percent suppression of FFAS (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The men and women had similar fasting insulin and FFA concentrations; however, in the men only, the percent suppression of FFA declined with increasing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (nonobese, 83 +/- 15%; <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, 73 +/- 18%; and severely <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, 69 +/- 19%; P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The women in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three BMI groups had lower FFA levels of 86-88% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>Obese</z:mp> African-American men and women are resistant to insulin as a glucoregulatory hormone, but only <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> men are resistant to insulin's antilipolytic action; <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> African-American women are sensitive to insulin's antilipolytic action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The combined presence of sensitivity to insulin's antilipolytic action with resistance to insulin's glucoregulatory action in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> African-American women may contribute to their high prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
