<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to determine whether skeletal muscle uptake of plasma NEFA is abnormal during the postprandial state in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Thigh muscle blood flow and oxidative metabolism indexes and NEFA uptake were determined using <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography coupled with computed tomography (PET/CT) with [(11)C]<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> and 14(R,S)-[(18)F]fluoro-6-thia-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32365">heptadecanoic acid</z:chebi> ((18)FTHA) in seven healthy control subjects (CON) and seven subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during continuous oral intake of a liquid meal to achieve steady postprandial NEFA levels with insulin infusion to maintain similar plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the postprandial state, plasma NEFA level was higher in type 2 diabetic subjects versus CON (P &lt; 0.01), whereas plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was at the same level in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Muscle NEFA fractional extraction and blood flow index levels were 56% (P &lt; 0.05) and 24% (P = 0.27) lower in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, muscle NEFA uptake was similar to that of CON (quadriceps femoris [QF] 1.47 ± 0.23 vs. 1.37 ± 0.24 nmol·g(-1)·min(-1), P = 0.77; biceps femoris [BF] 1.54 ± 0.26 vs. 1.46 ± 0.28 nmol·g(-1)·min(-1), P = 0.85) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Muscle oxidative metabolism was similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Muscle NEFA fractional extraction and blood flow index were strongly and positively correlated (r = 0.79, P &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Postprandial muscle NEFA uptake is <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> despite elevated systemic NEFA levels and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> normalization of plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Lower postprandial muscle blood flow with resulting reduction in muscle NEFA fractional extraction may explain this phenomenon </plain></SENT>
