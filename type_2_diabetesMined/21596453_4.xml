<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) is a predictor of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and nonalcoholic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>fatty liver</z:hpo> disease (NAFLD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to determine the levels of serum FGF21 and hs-CRP in newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients with and without NAFLD, and further explored the correlation between FGF21 with hs-CRP in newly diagnosed type 2 DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: 69 patients with newly diagnosed type 2 DM and 30 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FGF21 and hs-CRP were measured by ELISA kits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The severity of NAFLD was measured by ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum FGF21 in newly diagnosed type 2 DM with NAFLD group were significantly increased (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no difference for the FGF21 level in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control group and newly diagnosed type 2 DM without NFALD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In type 2 DM group, the FGF21 level was positively correlated with hsCRP (r=0.417, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In multiple stepwise regression models, only hsCRP was a significantly independent determinant for serum FGF21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Serum levels of FGF21 are closely related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>liver steatosis</z:hpo> in newly diagnosed type 2 DM patients </plain></SENT>
