<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Herein we have compared two mouse models expressing equally small amounts of transgenic proinsulin in pancreatic β-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In hProCpepGFP mice, human proinsulin (tagged with green fluorescent protein [GFP] within the connecting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29435">[C]</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>) is folded in the ER, exported, converted to human insulin, and secreted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In hProC(A7)Y-CpepGFP mice, misfolding of transgenic mutant proinsulin causes its retention in the ER </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis of neonatal pancreas in both transgenic animals shows each β-cell stained positively for endogenous insulin and transgenic protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At this transgene expression level, most male hProC(A7)Y-CpepGFP mice do not develop frank <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, yet the misfolded proinsulin perturbs insulin production from endogenous proinsulin and activates ER stress response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In nondiabetic adult hProC(A7)Y-CpepGFP males, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> β-cells continue to abundantly express transgene <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, however, a subset of β-cells in each islet becomes largely devoid of endogenous insulin, with some of these cells accumulating large quantities of misfolded mutant proinsulin, whereas another subset of β-cells has much less accumulated misfolded mutant proinsulin, with some of these cells containing abundant endogenous insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate a source of pancreatic compensation before the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> caused by proinsulin misfolding with ER stress, i.e., the existence of an important subset of β-cells with relatively limited accumulation of misfolded proinsulin protein and maintenance of endogenous insulin production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Generation and maintenance of such a subset of β-cells may have implications in the avoidance of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
