<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seven healthy subjects, matched for sex, age, and BMI, served as control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rates of net hepatic glycogenolysis, estimated by <z:chebi fb="18" ids="36928">13C</z:chebi> nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, were combined with estimates of contributions to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, measured by labeling of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> by 2H from ingested 2H2O </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> production was measured using [6,6-2H2]<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rate of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production was twice as high in the diabetic subjects as in control subjects (0.70 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.36 +/- 0.03 mmol x m(-2) min(-1), P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> reduced that rate by 24% (to 0.53 +/- 0.03 mmol x m(-2) x min(-1), P = 0.0009) and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration by 30% (to 10.8 +/- 0.9 mmol/l, P = 0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rate of gluconeogenesis was three times higher in the diabetic subjects than in the control subjects (0.59 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.18 +/- 0.03 mmol x m(-2) min(-1) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> reduced that rate by 36% (to 0.38 +/- 0.03 mmol x m(-2) x min(-1), P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By the 2H2O method, there was a twofold increase in rates of gluconeogenesis in diabetic subjects (0.42 +/- 0.04 mmol m(-2) x min(-1), which decreased by 33% after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> treatment (0.28 +/- 0.03 mmol x m(-2) x min(-1), P = 0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> cycling in the control subjects, but in the diabetic subjects, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> cycling contributed to 25% of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production and explains the differences between the two methods used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, patients with poorly controlled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have increased rates of endogenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production, which can be attributed to increased rates of gluconeogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> lowered the rate of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production in these patients through a reduction in gluconeogenesis </plain></SENT>
