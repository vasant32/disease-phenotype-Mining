<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our goal was to identify the DNA sequences bound by this transcription factor in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We applied chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing to globally identify and map human DNA sequences bound by TCF7L2 in the colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cell line, HCT116, where it is abundantly expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 1,095 discrete binding sites across the genome, of which a subset were within 5 kb of 548 annotated NCBI Reference Sequence (RefSeq) genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Despite using a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell line, the most significant functions represented using pathway analysis software were related to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorders</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As one of the enriched categories was related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorders</z:e>, we queried our results against <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> published genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and found a highly significant over-representation of reported loci from among the genes bound by TCF7L2 within 5 kb (p = 7.50 × 10⁻¹⁵) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This observation was primarily driven by excess loci revealed from GWAS of metabolic and cardiovascular traits; however, there was no or only minor enrichment of GWAS-derived loci for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, and inflammatory or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the specific traits, the most enriched loci were for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and height </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When defining the distance from genes at 50 kb or 500 kb, this enrichment pattern persisted, with some additional evidence for enrichment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: A highly significant proportion of genes bound by TCF7L2 are known disease-associated loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that TCF7L2 is a central node in the regulation of human <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and other disease-associated genes </plain></SENT>
