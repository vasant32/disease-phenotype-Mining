<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Haplotype combination 112/121 defined by three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (UCSNP-43, -19 and -63) of CAPN 10 conferred the highest risk for T2DM in Mexican-Americans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we aim to examine whether these genetic variants contribute to the susceptibility for T2DM in a Chinese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of these three SNPs were determined in 168 patients with T2DM and 104 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Distribution of alleles, genotypes and haplotypes at three loci were not significantly different between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No difference was observed in the 112/121 haplotype combination distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, haplotype combination 112/221 was more prevalent in the control group than in T2DM group (16.35% versus 7.14%, p = 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Control subjects with haplotype combination 112/121 had higher serum cholesterol level than others without haplotype combination 112/121 (5.7 +/- 1.4 versus 5.2 +/- 0.7, p = 0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that haplotype combination 112/221 associated with reduced risk for T2DM and haplotype combination 112/121 might be a risk factor for increased serum cholesterol in Chinese population </plain></SENT>
