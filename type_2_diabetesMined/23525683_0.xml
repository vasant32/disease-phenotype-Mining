<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is unclear whether exercise training exerts an effect on quality of life, symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and emotional well-being in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review to assess the effects of exercise training on these outcomes in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase and ClinicalTrials.gov databases were searched </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The review included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of at least 4Â weeks' duration in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> that evaluated the effect of exercise training on quality of life, symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and/or emotional well-being compared with usual care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 1,261 retrieved articles, 20 RCTs were included with a total of 1,719 participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Quality of life was assessed in 16 studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Between-group comparisons showed no significant results for aerobic training with the exception of one study, and mixed results for resistance and combined training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> were assessed in four studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In only one study did the intervention decrease symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Emotional well-being was evaluated in four studies, which also showed conflicting results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> were evaluated in one study, which showed a significant improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The effects of exercise training on psychological outcomes in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are conflicting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Therefore, there is a need for further high-quality RCTs in order to gain greater insight into the role of exercise training in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
