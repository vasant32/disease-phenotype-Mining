<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study randomized 73 insulin-treated patients to twice weekly supervised aerobic and resistance training plus structured exercise counseling (EXE) or to counseling alone (CON) for 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical and laboratory parameters were assessed at baseline and at the end of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The volume of physical activity was significantly higher in the EXE versus the CON group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Values for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c), BMI, waist circumference, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, blood pressure, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> risk score were significantly reduced only in the EXE group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No major adverse events were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In insulin-treated subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, supervised exercise is safe and effective in improving glycemic control and markers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, thus counterbalancing the adverse effects of insulin on these parameters </plain></SENT>
