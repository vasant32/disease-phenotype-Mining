<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether they are changed in early diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> is not known and was examined in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TIMP-1 and collagen degradation products were also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results from subjects with and without diastolic dysfunction were compared with those obtained for patients with varying stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011881" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic renal disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with or without diastolic dysfunction with varying degrees of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal disease</z:e> were recruited for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Age-matched non-diabetic subjects served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MMPs (-1, -3 and -7) and TIMP-1 were measured by ELISA, MMP-2 and -9 by zymography and collagen degradation products by radioimmunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Differences in the pattern of MMPs/TIMPs and collagen degradation products were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most consistent change was in totalMMP-7, which was increased in those with diastolic dysfunction and those with macroalbuminuria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MMP-7 correlated with cardiac function (p&lt;0.05 vs control, in those with diastolic dysfunction), and renal filtration function (p&lt;0.05 vs control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In summary, we have identified novel relationships between serum MMP-7 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> specifically in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal disease</z:e> and in diastolic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>How increased circulating MMP-7 is associated with these diabetic microvascular complications and the significance of these findings will require prospective studies </plain></SENT>
