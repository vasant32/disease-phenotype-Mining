<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is managed through a stepwise program of intensive therapy that consists of lifestyle modifications and sequential addition of oral antihyperglycemic agents and insulin as necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Successful implementation of this approach lessens the microvascular complications of the disease and promotes a lifestyle that may reduce macrovascular complications and comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because of the progressive pancreatic beta-cell failure that causes <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, many people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> will ultimately require insulin for disease management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Insulin may be used alone or in combination with oral agents to achieve glycemic control with a minimum of side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although disease management regimens must be tailored to the needs of the individual with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the health care provider should always employ an aggressive, treat-to-target strategy to lower <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> and lessen <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related risk factors </plain></SENT>
