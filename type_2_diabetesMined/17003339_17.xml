<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100820'>glomerulopathy</z:hpo>, we compared glomerular gene expression profiles of db/db mice with those of db/m control mice at a normoalbuminuric stage characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> and at an early stage of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> with elevated <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp>, using cDNA microarray </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In db/db mice at the normoalbuminuric stage, <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), ephrin B2, glomerular epithelial protein 1, and Pod-1, which play key roles in glomerulogenesis, were already upregulated in parallel with an alteration of genes related to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism, and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Podocyte structure-related genes, actinin 4alpha and dystroglycan 1 (DG1), were also significantly upregulated at an early stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The alteration in the expression of these genes was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Through <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> treatment, gene expression of ephrin B2, Pod-1, actinin 4alpha, and DG1, as well as that of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism, was restored concomitant with attenuation of <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, HIF-1alpha protein expression was partially attenuated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that not only metabolic alteration and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, but also the alteration of gene expression related to glomerulogenesis and podocyte structure, may be involved in the pathogenesis of early diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100820'>glomerulopathy</z:hpo> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
