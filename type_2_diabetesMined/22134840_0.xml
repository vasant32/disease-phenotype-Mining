<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study population consisted of 4,994 persons aged ≥ 67 years, who participated in the Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility-Reykjavik Study (AGES-R) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> was defined as HbA(1c) ≥ 6.5% (&gt;48 mmol/mol) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>Retinopathy</z:hpo> was assessed by grading fundus photographs using the modified Airlie House adaptation of the Early Treatment Diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>Retinopathy</z:hpo> Study protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Associations between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> and risk factors were estimated using odds ratios obtained from multivariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> in AGES-R was 12.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>Diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> was present in 516 persons (10.3%), for 512 of whom gradable fundus photos were available, including 138 persons (27.0%, 95% CI 23.2, 31.0) with any <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five persons (1.0%, 95% CI 0.3, 2.3) had proliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clinically significant macular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> was present in five persons (1.0%, 95% CI 0.3, 2.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Independent risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> in diabetic patients in a multivariate model included HbA(1c), insulin use and use of oral hypoglycaemic agents, the last two being indicators of longer disease duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 4478 participants without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, gradable fundus photos were available for 4,453 participants, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> present in 476 (10.7%, 95% CI 9.8, 11.6) and clinically significant macular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> in three persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Independent risk factors included increasing age and <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Over three-quarters (78%) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> cases were found in persons without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and a strong association between <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> and non-diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results may have implications for patient management of the aged </plain></SENT>
