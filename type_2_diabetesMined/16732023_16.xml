<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Epidemiological studies suggest that high body iron stores are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between dietary intake of iron and the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study within the Nurses' Health Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We followed 85,031 healthy women aged 34-59 years from 1980 to 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dietary data were collected every 4 years, and data on medical history and lifestyle factors were updated biennially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the 20 years of follow-up, we documented 4,599 incident cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found no association between total, dietary, supplemental, or nonheme iron and the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> iron intake (derived from animal products) was positively associated with risk; relative risks (RRs) across increasing quintiles of cumulative intake were 1.00, 1.08 (95% CI 0.97-1.19), 1.20 (1.09-1.33), 1.27 (1.14-1.41), and 1.28 (1.14-1.45) (P(trend) &lt; 0.0001) after controlling for age, BMI, and other nondietary and dietary risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, when we modeled <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> iron in seven categories, the multivariate RR comparing women who consumed &gt; or =2.25 mg/day and those with intake &lt;0.75 mg/day was 1.52 (1.22-1.88) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The association between <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> iron and the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was significant in both overweight and lean women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This large cohort study suggests that higher <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> iron intake is associated with a significantly increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
