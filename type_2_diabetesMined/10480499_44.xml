<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e> (SMI) is more common in diabetic patients than in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the exact prevalence of SMI is not known, and routine screening is costly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this 1-year study was to estimate the prevalence of SMI and define a high-risk diabetic population by systematically testing patients with no symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The criteria for inclusion in this study were age (between 25 and 75 years), duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (&gt;15 years for type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 10 years for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, and 5 years for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with at least one <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factor</z:e>), and absence of clinical or electrocardiogram (ECG) symptoms of CAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For 1 year, 203 patients were screened, including 28 women and 45 men with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (aged 41.5+/-10.9 years, mean duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> 20.9+/-7.7 years [mean +/- SD]) and 61 women and 69 men with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (aged 60.7+/-8.7 years, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> 16.5+/-7.1 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Exercise ECG was the first choice for screening method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>If exercise ECG was not possible or inconclusive, <z:chebi fb="80" ids="30440">thallium</z:chebi> myocardial scintigraphy (TMS) with exercise testing and/or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4653">dipyridamole</z:chebi> injection was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>If any one of these tests was positive, coronary angiography was carried out and was considered to be positive with a stenosis of &gt; or =50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Positive screening results were obtained in 32 patients (15.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Coronary angiography demonstrated significant lesions in 19 patients (9.3%) and nonsignificant lesions in 7 patients (1 false-positive result for exercise ECG and 6 false-positive results for TMS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Coronary angiography was not performed in six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but 3 of the 19 patients (15 men and 4 women) in whom silent coronary lesions were detected presented with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The main differences between the 16 type 2 diabetic patients presenting with coronary lesions and the type 2 diabetic patients without SMI were a higher prevalence of peripheral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096293" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">macroangiopathy</z:e> (56.2 vs. 15.1%, respectively, P &lt; 0.01) and a higher prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between SMI and duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, HbA1c level, renal status, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> except for family history of CAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study allowed us to determine a high-risk group for SMI in the diabetic population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>SMI with significant lesions occurs in 20.9% of type 2 diabetic male patients who are totally asymptomatic for CAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Based on these findings, we recommend routine screening for male patients in whom the duration of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is &gt;10 years or even less when more than one <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factor</z:e> is present </plain></SENT>
