<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: We investigated the associations between indices of cholesterol metabolism and features of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> (MS) in the presence and absence of type-2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Men with the MS (N=140) and 10 age- and sex-matched controls were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasma lathosterol and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28623">campesterol</z:chebi> were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and their ratios to total cholesterol were used to estimate cholesterol metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, MS subjects had significantly higher lathosterol:cholesterol and lower <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28623">campesterol</z:chebi>:cholesterol ratios (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the MS subjects without T2DM (N=82), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28623">campesterol</z:chebi>:cholesterol ratio was positively associated with age and negatively associated with plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> and insulin concentrations, while in MS subjects with T2DM (N=58), the ratio was positively associated with age and adiponectin concentration, and negatively associated with BMI and insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Age and fasting insulin were independent predictors of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28623">campesterol</z:chebi>:cholesterol ratio in MS subjects with T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a significant negative association between plasma lathosterol:cholesterol with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28623">campesterol</z:chebi>:cholesterol ratio (r=-0.436, p=0.014) in MS subjects without T2DM but not in MS subjects with T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cholesterol absorption efficiency was lower and cholesterol synthesis higher in MS subjects with or without T2DM compared with healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the reciprocal relationship between cholesterol synthesis and cholesterol absorption is lost in the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
