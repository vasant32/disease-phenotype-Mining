<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop a precise risk score for the screening of large populations for individuals at high risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> based on noninvasive measurements of major risk factors in German study populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A prospective cohort study (European Prospective Investigation into <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> and Nutrition [EPIC]-Potsdam study) of 9,729 men and 15,438 women aged 35-65 years was used to derive a risk score predicting incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multivariate Cox regression model coefficients were used to weigh each variable in the calculation of the score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data from the EPIC-Heidelberg, the TÃ¼bingen Family Study for Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> (TUF), and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Metabolic Syndrome</z:e> Berlin Potsdam (MeSyBePo) study were used to validate this score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Information on age, waist circumference, height, history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, physical activity, smoking, and consumption of red meat, whole-grain bread, coffee, and alcohol formed the German <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Risk Score (mean 446 points [range 118-983]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The probability of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> within 5 years in the EPIC-Potsdam study increased from 0.3% for 300 to 23.2% for 750 score points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The area under the receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.84 in the EPIC-Potsdam and 0.82 in the EPIC-Heidelberg studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Correlation coefficients between the German <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Risk Score and insulin sensitivity in nondiabetic individuals were -0.56 in the TUF and -0.45 in the MeSyBePo studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ROC values for undiagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were 0.83 in the TUF and 0.75 in the MeSyBePo studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The German <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Risk Score (available at www.dife.de) is an accurate tool to identify individuals at high risk for or with undiagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
