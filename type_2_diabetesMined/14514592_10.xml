<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As a novel therapeutic agent, characteristics of its beta-cell effects are important to establish </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previously, beta-cell effects of GLP-1 have been characterized in humans during graded intravenous infusions of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, whereas its effects after more physiological stimuli, like meal intake, are not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Eight women (aged 69 years, fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> 3.7-10.3 mmol/l, BMI 22.4-43.9 kg/m(2)) who had fasted overnight were served a breakfast (450 kcal) with intravenous infusion of saline or synthetic GLP-1 (0.75 pmol x kg(-1) x min(-1)), and beta-cell function was evaluated by estimating the relationship between <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration and insulin secretion (calculated by deconvolution of C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> data) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: -GLP-1 markedly augmented insulin secretion, despite lower <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Total insulin secretion was 29.7 +/- 4.2 nmol/m(2) with GLP-1 versus 21.0 +/- 1.6 nmol/m(2) with saline (P = 0.048) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>GLP-1 increased the dose-response relationship between <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration and insulin secretion (70 +/- 26 with GLP-1 versus 38 +/- 16 pmol insulin </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>mmol(-1) <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>. l without, P = 0.037) and augmented the potentiation factor that modulates the dose response (2.71 +/- 0.42 with GLP-1 versus 0.97 +/- 0.17 without, P = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The potentiation factor correlated to GLP-1 concentration (r = 0.53, P &lt; 0.001); a 10-fold increase in GLP-1 levels produced a twofold increase in the potentiation factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These effects of GLP-1 did not correlate with fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels or BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Administration of GLP-1 along with ingestion of a meal augments insulin secretion in humans by a dose-dependent potentiation of the dose-response relationship between plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
