<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: People with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have impaired exercise responses even in the absence of cardiovascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One key factor associated with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003546'>exercise intolerance</z:hpo> is abnormally slowed oxygen uptake (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="30047">VO2</z:chebi>) kinetics during submaximal exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms of this delayed adaptation during exercise are unclear but probably relate to impairments in skeletal muscle blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to compare skeletal muscle deoxygenation (deoxygenated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="2" ids="7044">myoglobin</z:chebi> [HHb]) responses and estimated microvascular blood flow (Qm) kinetics in type 2 diabetic and healthy subjects after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of moderate exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Pulmonary <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30047">VO2</z:chebi> kinetics and [HHb] (using near-infrared spectroscopy) were measured in 11 type 2 diabetic and 11 healthy subjects during exercise transitions from unloaded to moderate cycling exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Qm responses were calculated using <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30047">VO2</z:chebi> kinetics and [HHb] responses via rearrangement of the Fick principle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30047">VO2</z:chebi> kinetics were slowed in type 2 diabetic compared with control subjects (43.8 +/- 9.6 vs. 34.2 +/- 8.2 s, P &lt; 0.05), and the initial [HHb] response after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of exercise exceeded the steady-state level of oxygen extraction in type 2 diabetic compared with control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean response time of the estimated Qm increase was prolonged in type 2 diabetic compared with healthy subjects (47.7 +/- 14.3 vs. 35.8 +/- 10.7 s, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Type 2 diabetic skeletal muscle demonstrates a transient imbalance of muscle O2 delivery relative to O2 uptake after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of exercise, suggesting a slowed Qm increase in type 2 diabetic muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Impaired vasodilatation due to vascular dysfunction in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during exercise may contribute to this observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further study of the mechanisms leading to impaired muscle oxygen delivery may help explain the abnormal exercise responses in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
