<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The aim of this study was to compare developments in the utilisation of antihyperglycaemic drugs (AHGDs) in ten European countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Data on the yearly utilisation of insulin and oral AHGDs were collected from public registers in Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Belgium, England, Germany, Italy, Portugal and Spain, and were expressed as defined daily doses per 1,000 inhabitants per day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Total AGHD utilisation increased everywhere, but at different rates and levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Insulin utilisation doubled in England and Germany, but hardly changed in Belgium, Portugal or Italy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">Sulfonylurea</z:chebi> utilisation doubled in Spain, England and Denmark but was reduced in Germany and Sweden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> utilisation increased greatly everywhere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were two- to three-fold differences in AHGD utilisation even between neighbouring countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In Finland, there were more users of both insulin (+120%) and oral AHGDs (+80%) than in Denmark, and the daily oral AHGD doses were higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In Denmark and Sweden, AHGD utilisation was equal in subjects aged &lt;45 years, but in those &gt;or=45 years of age, both insulin and oral AHGD utilisation were twice as high in Sweden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The ubiquitous increase in AHGD utilisation, particularly <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, seems logical, considering the increasing prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the results of the UK Prospective <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the large differences even between neighbouring countries are more difficult to explain, and suggest different habits and attitudes in terms of screening and management of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
