<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47612">bezafibrate</z:chebi> and pravastatin on remnant-like <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> particles (RLPs) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> subclasses were compared in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="47612">Bezafibrate</z:chebi> (400 mg/day) and pravastatin (10 mg/day) were given to 27 Japanese diabetics in a randomized crossover design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RLP cholesterol (RLP-C) and RLP <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> (RLP-TG) were measured by an immunoseparation technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> were separated each into three subclasses (large, medium, small) and their cholesterol (C) contents were measured by an HPLC method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RLP-C was reduced more effectively by pravastatin (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47612">bezafibrate</z:chebi> -16.0% vs. pravastatin -40.6%, P &lt; 0.05), whereas RLP-TG was reduced more effectively by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47612">bezafibrate</z:chebi> (-55.2% vs. -35.0%, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further, pravastatin decreased large and small <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> levels equally (large; -23.6%; medium; -17.2%, small; -21.0%), while <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47612">bezafibrate</z:chebi> produced a relatively larger reduction in small <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> (-12.1; -16.9; -21.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Whereas <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47612">bezafibrate</z:chebi> significantly decreased large <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> and increased medium and small <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> (-49.6; 34.1; 35.8%), pravastatin significantly increased only medium <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> (5.2; 9.4; 5.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="47612">Bezafibrate</z:chebi> reduced RLP-C and RLP-TG more effectively in patients with high TG levels, whereas pravastatin's effect was not markedly influenced by the initial TG level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus measurements of RLP-C, RLP-TG, and HPLC subclasses revealed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47612">bezafibrate</z:chebi> and pravastatin differently influence the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> status in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
