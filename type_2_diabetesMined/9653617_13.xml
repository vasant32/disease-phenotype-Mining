<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We were particularly interested in comparing the likelihood of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for those with persistent fasting <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> (PFH), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT), and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (NGT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PFH is a relatively new definition, and those with PFH used to be defined as NGT according to WHO criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Subjects were located in a 1992-1994 community-based population survey and followed up and reexamined during 1995-1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An OGTT was used to determine who had progressed to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Risk factors predictive of subsequent progression to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were determined by comparing baseline variables from the 1992-1994 survey with data of those who had or had not progressed to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in 1995-1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 654 high-risk subjects screened in the baseline survey, 481 (73.5%, 255 men and 226 women) were followed up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of these, 8.1% had progressed to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (4.1% progression/year, 95% CI 2.3-5.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of 131 baseline IGT subjects, 17.6% progressed to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (8.8% progression/year, 6.3-11.3), but only 7.4% of 95 PFH subjects (3.7% progression/year, 2.0-5.4) and 3.5% of 255 NGT subjects (1.8% progression/year, 0.1-3.0) progressed to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The rates of progression to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were lowest from the NGT subgroup, highest from the IGT group, with the PFH group in the middle, suggesting that PFH might be a transitional condition that precedes IGT and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Other significant predictors of subsequent <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were baseline BMI, baseline <z:hpo ids='HP_0002149'>hyperuricemia</z:hpo>, baseline FPG, and 2-h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration </plain></SENT>
