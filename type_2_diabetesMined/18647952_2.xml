<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>Hyperglycemia</z:hpo> is the cause of long-term complications of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> as well as <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> itself, and POPs are well-known <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50910">neurotoxicants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was performed to explore whether POPs are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo>, a common long-term complication of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, in people with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied cross-sectional associations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> with 25 POPs, each of which were detectable in at least 60% of study subjects, in 246 subjects aged &gt;or=40 years with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (IFG) using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2002 datasets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among five subclasses of POPs, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38656">organochlorine pesticides</z:chebi> showed a strong dose-response relation with prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo>; adjusted ORs were 1.0, 3.6, and 7.3 (P for trend &lt;0.01), respectively, across three categories of serum concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38656">organochlorine pesticides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, when we restricted the analyses to 187 participants with A1C &lt;7%, the adjusted ORs were still 1.0, 3.9, and 6.7 (P for trend &lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="38656">Organochlorine pesticides</z:chebi> were also strongly associated with the prevalence of A1C &gt;or=7%; adjusted ORs were 1.0, 2.5, and 5.0 (P for trend &lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Specific POPs belonging to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38656">organochlorine pesticides</z:chebi> showed similar positive associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that background exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38656">organochlorine pesticides</z:chebi> may be associated with higher risk of peripheral neuropathic complications among those with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> abnormalities, even beyond the influence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> itself </plain></SENT>
