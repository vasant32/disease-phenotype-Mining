<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study sought to determine the role of NO in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake during exercise in individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nine men with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and nine control subjects matched for age, sex, peak pulmonary oxygen uptake (VO(2) peak), and weight completed two 25-min bouts of cycling exercise at 60 +/- 2% VO(2) peak, separated by 90 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>N(G)-monomethyl-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28229">L-NMMA</z:chebi>) (total dose 6 mg/kg) or placebo was administered into the femoral artery for the final 15 min of exercise in a counterbalanced, blinded, crossover design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LBF was measured by thermodilution in the femoral vein, and leg <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake was calculated as the product of LBF and femoral arteriovenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During exercise with placebo, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake was not different between control subjects and individuals with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; however, LBF was lower and arterial plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin levels were higher in individuals with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
