<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To test effects of a web-based decision support tool, the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> Disease Management Application (DMA), developed to improve evidence-based management of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a group randomized controlled trial of 12 intervention and 14 control staff providers and 307 intervention and 291 control patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a hospital-based internal medicine clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Providers were randomly assigned from May 1998 through April 1999 to have access to the DMA (intervention) or not to have access (control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The DMA displays interactive patient-specific clinical data, treatment advice, and links to other web-based care resources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We compared patients in the intervention and control groups for changes in processes and outcomes of care from the year preceding the study through the year of the study by intention-to-treat analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The DMA was used for 42% of scheduled patient visits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of HbA(1c) tests obtained per year increased significantly in the intervention group (+0.3 tests/year) compared with the control group (-0.04 tests/year, P = 0.008), as did the number of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> tests (intervention, +0.2 tests/year; control, +0.01 tests/year; P = 0.02) and the proportions of patients undergoing at least one foot examination per year (intervention, +9.8%; control, -0.7%; P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Levels of HbA(1c) decreased by 0.2 in the intervention group and increased by 0.1 in the control group (P = 0.09); proportions of patients with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> levels &lt;130 mg/dl increased by 20.3% in the intervention group and 10.5% in the control group (P = 0.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Web-based patient-specific decision support has the potential to improve evidence-based parameters of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care </plain></SENT>
