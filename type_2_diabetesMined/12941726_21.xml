<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether screening-detected diabetic patients differ from diabetic patients newly diagnosed in general practice with regard to the presence of microvascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH AND DESIGN METHODS: Diabetic patients, identified by a population-based targeted screening procedure consisting of a screening questionnaire and a fasting capillary whole-blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> measurement followed by diagnostic testing, were compared with patients newly diagnosed with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in general practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>Retinopathy</z:hpo> was assessed with fundus photography, impaired foot sensitivity was assessed with Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments, and the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> was measured by means of the albumin-to-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio (ACR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 195 screening-detected type 2 diabetic patients and 60 patients newly diagnosed in general practice participated in the medical examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> was higher in screening-detected type 2 diabetic patients than in patients newly diagnosed in general practice, but not significantly higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> was 7.6% (95% CI 4.6-12.4) in screening-detected type 2 diabetic patients and 1.9% (0.3-9.8) in patients newly diagnosed in general practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of impaired foot sensitivity was similar in both groups, 48.1% (40.9-55.3) and 48.3% (36.2-60.7), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ACR was 0.61 (interquartile range 0.41-1.50) in screening-detected type 2 diabetic patients and 0.99 (0.53-2.49) in patients newly diagnosed in general practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The difference in prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> was 17.2% (95% CI 12.5-23.2) and 26.7% (17.1-39.0) in screening-detected type 2 diabetic patients and patients newly diagnosed in general practice, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Targeted screening for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (with a screening questionnaire as a first step) resulted in the identification of previously undiagnosed diabetic patients with a considerable prevalence of microvascular complications </plain></SENT>
