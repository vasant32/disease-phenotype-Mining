<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> type 2 diabetic patients (n = 1,409) aged 56-74 years attending the Verona <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Clinic and having at least two FPG determinations in each of the years 1984-1986 were followed for 10 years (1987-1996) to assess total and cause-specific mortality Patients were grouped into tertiles of mean and CV of FPG during 1984-1986 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These parameters as well as sex, age, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration, insulin treatment, smoking, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> were included in multivariate survival analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the follow-up, 468 patients died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CV of FPG was an independent predictor of total, cardiovascular, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean FPG was a predictor of total mortality only when the CV of FPG was not included in the analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Long-term variability of fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> is an independent predictor of mortality in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The CV of FPG might be considered a useful additional parameter in the management of these patients </plain></SENT>
