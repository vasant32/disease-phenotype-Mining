<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Prevention Program (DPP) was a large, multicenter, randomized clinical trial testing interventions to prevent or delay type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A major challenge was to identify eligible high-risk adults, defined by DPP as having both <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) (2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> 140-199 mg/dl) and elevated fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (EFG) (95-125 mg/dl) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed how screening yields would be affected by the presence of established risk factors such as age, sex, ethnicity, BMI, and family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and how much yields would be enhanced by preselecting individuals with elevated capillary blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 158,177 contacted adults, 79,190 were potentially eligible (no history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, age 25 years and older, BMI &gt; or =24 kg/m2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We focus on the 30,383 participants who completed an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Based on OGTT, 27% had IGT with EFG, meeting DPP eligibility criteria for being at high risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and 13% had previously undiagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> based on OGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Older age and higher BMI increased yield of high-risk individuals and those with newly discovered <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in most ethnic groups (whites, African Americans, Hispanics, and American Indians) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In Asian Americans, age but not BMI predicted high risk and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Independent of age and BMI, the preliminary fasting capillary <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> predicted screening yield in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ethnic groups, with an inverted-U pattern defining DPP eligibility alone (IGT-EFG) and a steep curvilinear pattern defining either IGT-EFG or newly discovered <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fasting capillary <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> did not attenuate the affects of other participant characteristics in predicting IGT-EFG or the combination of IGT-EFG and newly discovered <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The DPP screening approach identified adults with or at high risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> across various ethnic groups and provided guidance to more efficient use of OGTTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Fasting capillary <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> is a useful adjunct in screening programs combined with data on age and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> </plain></SENT>
