<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine whether the hepatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is due to impaired insulin-induced suppression of glycogenolysis as well as gluconeogenesis, 10 lean nondiabetic, 10 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> nondiabetic, and 11 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> type 2 diabetic subjects were studied after an overnight fast and during a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis were measured using the deuterated water method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Before the clamp, when <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin concentrations differed among the three groups, gluconeogenesis was higher in the diabetic than in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> nondiabetic subjects (P &lt; 0.05) and glycogenolysis was higher in the diabetic than in the lean nondiabetic subjects (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the clamp, when <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin concentrations were matched and glucagon concentrations were suppressed, both glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis were higher (P &lt; 0.01) in the diabetic versus the <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and lean nondiabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis were higher (P &lt; 0.01) in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> than in the lean nondiabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma free fatty acid concentrations correlated (P &lt; 0.001) with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production and gluconeogenesis both before and during the clamp and with glycogenolysis during the clamp (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We concluded that defects in the regulation of glycogenolysis as well as gluconeogenesis cause hepatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> nondiabetic and type 2 diabetic humans </plain></SENT>
