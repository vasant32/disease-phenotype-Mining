<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY SETTING: A disease management program was offered, on a voluntary basis, to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> T2D patients who were members of a statutory health insurance fund in Germany </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This first feasibility report uses data from 26.742 T2D patients, who were 40 to 79 years old, resided in the Muenster District, and who were enrolled between June 2003 and July 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> cases were identified through the regional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677898" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Invasive cancer</z:e> cases were identified using probabilistic record linkage procedures and pseudonymised personal identifiers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Censoring date was December 31, 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We included only first <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, leaving 12.650 male and 14.092 female T2D with a total of 88.778 person-years (py) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We computed standardised incidence ratios (SIR) for external comparisons and we employed Cox regression models and hazard ratios (HR) within the cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 759 first <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> among male T2D patients (18.7 per 1,000 py) and 605 among females (12.7 per 1,000 py) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The risk of any incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in T2D was raised (SIR = 1.14; 95% confidence interval [1.10 - 1.21]), in particular for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0279000,C0345904" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer of the liver</z:e> (SIR = 1.94 [1.15 - 2.94]) and pancreas (SIR = 1.45 [1.07-1.92]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>SIRs decreased markedly with time after T2D diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In Cox models, adjusting for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration, body mass index and sex, insulin therapy was related to higher <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk (HR = 1.25 [1.17 - 1.33]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No effect was seen for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Our study demonstrates feasibility of record linkage between DMP and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These first cohort results confirm previous reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>It is envisaged to enhance this cohort by inclusion of further regions of the state, expansion of the follow-up times, and collection of a more detailed medication history </plain></SENT>
