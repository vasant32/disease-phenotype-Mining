<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis for this risk difference has not been fully elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether female sex was associated with macrovascular disease and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, independently of known risk factors related to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> in normotensive patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective, prolonged follow-up study of a subgroup of 67 diabetic patients (46 men and 21 women) without established <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> who participated in a larger clinical trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data were collected on current and past health, medication use, blood pressure, renal function, and HbA(1c) during the follow-up period of 4.7 +/- 0.8 (means +/- SE) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The end point was a composite of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, cerebrovascular events, and peripheral artery disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the women, eight (38.1%) met the end point compared with six (13.4%) of the men (P = 0.02 for difference in event-free survival) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The hazard ratio of women relative to men was 3.19 (95% CI 1.11-9.21), which further increased after adjusting for age, systolic blood pressure, BMI, smoking, total-to-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> ratio, urinary albumin excretion, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In our study population of normotensive patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp>, female sex was associated with increased risk of fatal and nonfatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, independent of the classical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> or presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, or health care utilization </plain></SENT>
