<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>From a family of 16 diabetic patients with typical maternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo>, we investigated a 69-year-old woman with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The proband showed no major deletions in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> DNA (mtDNA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Direct sequencing revealed 7 missense and 5 ribosomal <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> homoplasmic nucleotide substitutions when compared with the Cambridge Sequence and its recent revision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When compared with the control cybrid cells, the proband cybrid cells showed 6 nucleotide substitutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among these, 14577 T/C, which turned out to be 98.9% heteroplasmic, is a new missense substitution in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi> dehydrogenase 6 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also observed 2 other patients with 14577 T/C substitution from another group of 252 unrelated diabetic patients, whereas no individual from a group of 529 control subjects had 14577 T/C substitution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, these 6 substitutions were in linkage disequilibrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>Mitochondrial</z:hpo> respiratory chain complex I activity and O2 consumption rates of the proband cybrid cells, which were obtained by the fusion of mtDNA-deleted (rho0) HeLa cells and mtDNA from the proband, showed 64.5 and 61.5% reductions, respectively, compared with control cybrid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present study strongly indicates that the new mtDNA mutation at 14577 T/C is probably a major pathogenic mutation for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in this family </plain></SENT>
