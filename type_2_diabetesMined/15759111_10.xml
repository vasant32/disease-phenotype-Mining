<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 32 offspring of type 2 diabetic parents and 32 control individuals by means of DXA, indirect calorimetry, insulin clamp and 1H MRS of the calf muscles, and differences between and within study groups were analysed before and after segregation by quartiles of fasting <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> oxidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In comparison with control subjects, the offspring showed impaired insulin sensitivity, which was associated with higher fasting intramyocellular <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> content (Spearman's rho -0.35; p=0.04), but fasting <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> oxidation did not differ between groups (1.21+/-0.46 vs. 1.25+/-0.37 mg.kg(-1) lean body mass per min; p=0.70) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, offspring in the lowest quartile of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> oxidation had the most severe impairment of insulin sensitivity and a strong association was shown between <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> oxidation and insulin sensitivity within quartiles (Spearman's rho 0.47; p=0.01); this was not observed within the control group (Spearman's rho 0.13; p=0.47) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intramyocellular <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> content was not significantly different within quartiles of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> oxidation in either of the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Insulin sensitivity improved across increasing quartiles of fasting <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> oxidation in the offspring group, but remained constant in the control group, supporting the hypothesis that impaired fat oxidation is a primary pathogenic factor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in people with a genetic background for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite their association with impaired insulin sensitivity, soleus and tibialis anterior intramyocellular <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> content remained constant across increasing quartiles of fasting <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> oxidation within both groups </plain></SENT>
