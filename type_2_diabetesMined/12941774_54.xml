<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To examine whether genes associated with cellular defense against <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> are associated with insulin sensitivity, patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 7) and age-matched (n = 5) and young (n = 9) control subjects underwent a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp for 120 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Muscle samples were obtained before and after the clamp and analyzed for heat shock protein (<z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi>)72 and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase (HO)-1 mRNA, intramuscular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> content, and the maximal activities of beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (beta-HAD) and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50744">citrate</z:chebi> synthase (CS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Basal expression of both HSP72 and HO-1 mRNA were lower (P &lt; 0.05) by 33 and 55%, respectively, when comparing diabetic patients with age-matched and young control subjects, with no differences between the latter groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both basal HSP72 (r = 0.75, P &lt; 0.001) and HO-1 (r = 0.50, P &lt; 0.05) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression correlated with the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion rate during the clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant correlations were also observed between HSP72 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and both beta-HAD (r = 0.61, P &lt; 0.01) and CS (r = 0.65, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HSP72 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was induced (P &lt; 0.05) by the clamp in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although HO-1 mRNA was unaffected by the clamp in both the young and age-matched control subjects, it was increased (P &lt; 0.05) approximately 70-fold in the diabetic patients after the clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that genes involved in providing cellular protection against <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> are defective in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and correlate with insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal and markers of muscle oxidative capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The data provide new evidence that the pathogenesis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> involves perturbations to the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> defense mechanism within skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
