<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We searched electronic literature databases and reference lists of relevant articles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A fixed or random effects model was used on the basis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sub-group and meta-regression analyses were conducted to explore the sources of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no statistically significant associations between +45T&gt;G (rs2241766), +276G&gt;T (rs1501299), -11391G&gt;A (rs17300539) and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, for -11377C&gt;G (rs266729), the pooled OR (95% CI) for G vs C allele was 1.07 (1.03-1.11, p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analysis by study design revealed that -11377C&gt;G (rs266729) dominant model (CG+GG vs CC, p = 0.0008) and G vs C allele (p = 0.0004) might be associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk in population-based case-control studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After stratification by ethnicity, we found that -11377C&gt;G (rs266729) dominant model (CG+GG vs CC, p = 0.004) and G vs C allele (p = 0.001) might be associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk in white individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In individuals with a family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the presence of -11391G&gt;A (rs17300539) dominant model (GA+AA vs GG) and A vs G allele might be associated with increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The presence of +45T&gt;G (rs2241766), +276G&gt;T (rs1501299) and -11391G&gt;A (rs17300539) do not appear to influence the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, G vs C allele of -11377C&gt;G (rs266729) might be a risk factor for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
