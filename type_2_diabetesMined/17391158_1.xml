<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated prevalence of LV diastolic dysfunction and diagnostic utility of brain-natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (BNP) in asymptomatic patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Plasma BNP levels and LV geometry and diastolic filling indices, including the ratio of peak early transmitral Doppler flow (E) over flow propagation velocity (Vp) measured by colour M-mode Doppler echocardiography, were analysed in 98 consecutive asymptomatic patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and 51 age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The LV mass index and relative wall thickness were higher in diabetic groups than controls without any differences in LV systolic function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of diastolic dysfunction defined as E/Vp &gt; or = 1.5 were 31% in diabetic groups and 15% in controls (chi(2) = 4.364, p = 0.037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, a BNP cutoff value of 19.2 pg/ml in controls had a 53.1% positive predictive value (53.1%) and a high negative predictive value (94.4%) for E/Vp &gt;/= 1.5, whereas a BNP cutoff value of 18.1 pg/ml in diabetic groups had a 61.8% positive and 97.3% negative predictive values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of E/Vp &gt; or = 1.5 was higher in asymptomatic diabetic patients, suggesting that LV diastolic dysfunction was prevalent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The plasma concentration of BNP could be used to depict LV diastolic dysfunction in such population </plain></SENT>
