<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have indicated that the latent autoimmune <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in adults (LADA) phenotype is <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> and that LADA patients share features of type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in various proportions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested for association of known type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility genes in LADA subjects and analyzed relationships to a marker of autoimmune activity (titers of anti-GAD) and a phenotypic risk factor of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (BMI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data were assembled from the Nord-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Tr</z:e>Ã¸ndelag Health Study (HUNT) study, which comprises the adult population of an entire county in Norway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We genotyped 60 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) known to be associated with type 1 or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, including 14 tag SNPs used for HLA haplotyping in 120 type 1 diabetic, 126 LADA, and 1,090 type 2 diabetic patients and 1,503 age- and sex-matched nondiabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The majority of the strongly associated HLA haplotypes for type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were significantly associated with LADA in general, but mainly with high anti-GAD LADA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two distinct HLA haplotypes were associated only with LADA and mainly in low anti-GAD LADA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no associations of non-HLA type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> loci with LADA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-associated genes, the CC/CT genotypes of rs7961581 (TSPAN8) and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-linked AA/AC genotypes of rs8050136 (FTO) were associated with LADA in general, but mainly in low anti-GAD LADA patients (P = 0.004 and P = 0.004, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>Genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> in LADA is linked to various degrees of autoimmune activity and may be partly distinct from both type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
