<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This subgroup analysis of the German cohort of PREDICTIVE evaluates over 3 months, patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were transferred to insulin detemir +/- oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs (OADs) from an OAD-only regimen (n = 1321), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin +/- OADs (n = 251) or insulin glargine +/- OADs (n = 260) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups, 3 months after starting treatment with insulin detemir, total, daytime and nocturnal hypoglycaemic events/patient were reduced by 84, 80 and 90%, respectively, from baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No major hypoglycaemic events were reported during treatment with insulin detemir </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HbAlc was significantly reduced from baseline in each of the subgroups (-1.29,-0.60 and-0.59% for patients previously taking OADs only, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin +/- OADs and insulin glargine +/- OADs respectively; p &lt; 0.0001), as was fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FBG) (-58.1,-29.1 and-24.6 mg/dl; p &lt; 0.0001) and FBG variability-8.2 mg/dl,-5.7 mg/dl; p &lt; 0.0001 and -5.1 mg/dl; p = 0.0008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subgroups combined lost an average of 0.9 kg of body weight (p &lt; 0.0001) during the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Total daily basal insulin dose increased slightly from baseline for those patients on a prior insulin regimen, and in this study 79% of patients used insulin detemir once daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm the short-term safety and efficacy of insulin detemir +/- OADs in a real-world scenario and support the findings of randomized controlled clinical trials with insulin detemir, including its limited effects on body weight </plain></SENT>
