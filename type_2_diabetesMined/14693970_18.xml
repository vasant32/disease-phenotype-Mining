<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether plasma levels of free fatty acids (FFAs) are independently associated with incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A case-cohort design was used to randomly select 580 incident cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 566 noncases from 10,275 African-American and white men and women in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Risk in Communities study, aged 45-64 years and without prevalent <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at the baseline exam </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was ascertained at three exams over 9 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FFA levels were measured in plasma samples collected at the baseline exam </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, FFA level was inversely associated with height and positively associated with female sex, BMI, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, heart rate, plasma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, and an <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> score quantifying levels of six systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Relative risks for incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (fourth vs. first quartile of FFAs) were increased in a basic model adjusted for age, sex, race, and center (hazard ratio 1.68, 95% CI 1.20-2.34) and in a model further adjusted for baseline fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, BMI, waist circumference, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, and the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> score (1.63, 1.04-2.57) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Relative risks associated with a greater FFA level were lowest among those of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> weight and highest among the <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, but a formal test of interaction between FFAs and BMI was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with higher fasting levels of plasma FFAs were at modestly higher risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in this cohort of middle-aged adults </plain></SENT>
