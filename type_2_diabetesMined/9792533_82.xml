<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The insulinotropic hormone, glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> 1 (GLP-1), which has been proposed as a new treatment for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, is metabolized extremely rapidly by the ubiquitous enzyme, dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV), resulting in the formation of a metabolite, which may act as an <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> at the GLP-1 receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of this, the effects of single injections of GLP-1 are short-lasting, and for full demonstration of its antidiabetogenic effects, continuous intravenous infusion is required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To exploit the therapeutic potential of GLP-1 clinically, we here propose the use of specific inhibitors of DPP-IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have demonstrated that the administration of such inhibitors may completely protect exogenous GLP-1 from DPP-IV-mediated degradation, thereby greatly enhancing its insulinotropic effect, and provided evidence that endogenous GLP-1 may be equally protected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preliminary studies by others in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-intolerant experimental animals have shown that DPP-IV inhibition greatly ameliorates the condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>GLP-1 has multifaceted actions, which include stimulation of insulin gene expression, trophic effects on the beta-cells, inhibition of glucagon secretion, promotion of satiety, inhibition of food intake, and slowing of gastric emptying, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which contribute to normalizing elevated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because of this, we predict that inhibition of DPP-IV, which will elevate the levels of active GLP-1 and reduce the levels of the antagonistic metabolite, may be useful to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> and perhaps prevent transition to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The actions of DPP-IV, other than degradation of GLP-1, particularly in the immune system are discussed, but it is concluded that side effects of inhibition therapy are likely to be mild </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, DPP-IV inhibition may be an effective supplement to diet and exercise treatment in attempts to prevent the deterioration of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism associated with the Western lifestyle </plain></SENT>
