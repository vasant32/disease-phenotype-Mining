<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known about current physician and patient views regarding type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> genetic testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesised that physician and patient views would differ regarding the impact of genetic testing on motivation and adherence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We surveyed a nationally representative sample of US primary care physicians and endocrinologists (n = 304), a random sample of non-diabetic primary care patients (n = 152) and patients enrolled in a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> pharmacogenetics study (n = 89) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Physicians and patients favoured genetic testing for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk prediction (79% of physicians vs 80% of non-diabetic patients would be somewhat/very likely to order/request testing, p = 0.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>More patients than physicians (71% vs 23%, p &lt; 0.01) indicated that a 'high risk' result would be very likely to improve motivation to adopt preventive lifestyle changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients favoured genetic testing to guide therapy (78% of patients vs 48% of physicians very likely to request/recommend testing, p &lt; 0.01) and reported that genetic testing would make them 'much more motivated' to adhere to medications (72% vs 18% of physicians, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Many physicians (39%) would be somewhat/very likely to order genetic testing before published evidence of clinical efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Despite the paucity of current data, physicians and patients reported high expectations that genetic testing would improve patient motivation to adopt key behaviours for the prevention or control of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This suggests the testable hypothesis that 'genetic' risk information might have greater value to motivate behaviour change compared with standard risk information </plain></SENT>
