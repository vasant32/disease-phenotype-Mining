<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We estimated the frequency of the -396 A/G polymorphism of the TSC-22 gene with an Alu I-Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) method in 498 Japanese subjects with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also determined the promoter activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diabetic patients with the AA genotype had a significantly higher incidence of the diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> (vs. the AG genotype, P&lt;0.05, odds ratio: 1.95; 95% confidence intervals 1.14-3.33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the promoter activity between the fragments with -396A and -396G </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the TSC-22 gene (-396) A allele is associated with an increasing risk of the diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
