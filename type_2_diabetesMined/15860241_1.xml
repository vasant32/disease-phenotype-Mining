<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred out of 133 women of seven <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> education groups from different Mexican institutions located in the city of Tijuana were invited to participate in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A PA history questionnaire was completed weekly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Metabolic Equivalents (METs) were used to calculate physical activity level (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PAL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty percent were classified as overweight and 31% as <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six percent of the women performed more than 150 min of moderate/vigorous weekly PA, while more than 80 min of weekly PA was reported by 73% of the population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in frequency and intensity of PA between the participants from both institutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The main indoor activities were cooking, dish washing, clothes washing and cleaning, and the main outdoor activities were walking, semi-active exercise and running </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The majority of these migrant women who participated in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> intervention program seem to engage in the minimum recommended levels of PA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In a country like Mexico, where its public health care system is facing huge economic constraints, PA counseling done in a primary health care practice may be a cost-effective approach </plain></SENT>
