<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine age of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosis in youth who have a parent with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> type and whether the parent's <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was diagnosed before or after the youth's birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The cohort comprised SEARCH for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> in Youth Study participants (<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosis 2001-2005) with a diabetic parent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SEARCH is a multicenter survey of youth with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosed before age 20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Youth with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were more likely to have a parent with either type 1 or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (mother 39.3%; father 21.2%) than youth with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (5.3 and 6.7%, respectively, P &lt; 0.001 for each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was diagnosed 1.68 years earlier among those exposed to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in utero (n = 174) than among those whose mothers' <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was diagnosed later (P = 0.018, controlled for maternal diagnosis age, paternal <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, sex, and race/ethnicity) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Age at diagnosis of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for 269 youth with and without in utero exposure did not differ significantly (difference 0.96 year, P = 0.403 after adjustment) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Controlled for the father's age of diagnosis, father's <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> before the child's birth was not associated with age at diagnosis (P = 0.078 for type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; P = 0.140 for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was diagnosed at younger ages among those exposed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> in utero </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among youth with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the effect of the intrauterine exposure was not significant when controlled for mother's age of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study helps explain why other studies have found higher age-specific rates of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among offspring of women with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
