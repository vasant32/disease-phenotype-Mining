<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found differential DNA methylation of genes in biological pathways including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (MAPK), insulin, and calcium signaling (P ≤ 0.007) and of individual genes with known function in muscle, including MAPK1, MYO18B, HOXC6, and the <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase subunit PRKAB1 in skeletal muscle of FH(+) compared with FH(-) men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We further validated our findings from FH(+) men in monozygotic twin pairs discordant for T2D, and 40% of 65 analyzed genes exhibited differential DNA methylation in muscle of both FH(+) men and diabetic twins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We further examined if a 6-month exercise intervention modifies the genome-wide DNA methylation pattern in skeletal muscle of the FH(+) and FH(-) individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DNA methylation of genes in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50211">retinol</z:chebi> metabolism and calcium signaling pathways (P &lt; 3 × 10(-6)) and with known functions in muscle and T2D including MEF2A, RUNX1, NDUFC2, and THADA decreased after exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Methylation of these human promoter regions suppressed reporter gene expression in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, both expression and methylation of several genes, i.e., ADIPOR1, BDKRB2, and TRIB1, changed after exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings provide new insights into how genetic background and environment can alter the human epigenome </plain></SENT>
