<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of repaglinide in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> with monotherapy of each drug on glycemic control in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 83 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who had inadequate glycemic control (HbA1c &gt; 7.1%) when receiving the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> agent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> were enrolled in this multicenter, double-blind trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects were randomized to continue with their prestudy dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (n = 27), to continue with their prestudy dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> with the addition of repaglinide (n = 27), or to receive repaglinide alone (n = 29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For patients receiving repaglinide, the optimal dose was determined during a 4- to 8-week titration and continued for a 3-month maintenance period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In subjects receiving combined therapy, HbA1c was reduced by 1.4 +/- 0.2%, from 8.3 to 6.9% (P = 0.0016) and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> by 2.2 mmol/l (P = 0.0003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant changes were observed in subjects treated with either repaglinide or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy in HbA1c (0.4 and 0.3% decrease, respectively) or fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (0.5 mmol/l increase and 0.3 mmol/l decrease respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subjects receiving repaglinide either alone or in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, had an increase in fasting levels of insulin between baseline and the end of the trial of 4.04 +/- 1.56 and 4.23 +/- 1.50 mU/l, respectively (P &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Gastrointestinal adverse events were common in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An increase in body weight occurred in the repaglinide and combined therapy groups (2.4 +/- 0.5 and 3.0 +/- 0.5 kg, respectively; P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Combined <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and repaglinide therapy resulted in superior glycemic control compared with repaglinide or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> whose glycemia had not been well controlled on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Repaglinide monotherapy was as effective as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy </plain></SENT>
