<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 32 consecutive Japanese patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were assigned to either a high-BNP (&gt;or=18 pg/ml) group (n=12; age 57+/-13 years, mean+/-S.D.) or a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-BNP (&lt;18 pg/ml) group (n=20; 59+/-10 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No patient had any overt structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cardiac autonomic function was assessed by measurements of baroreflex sensitivity (BRS), heart rate variability (HRV) and cardiac (123)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BRS was lower (p&lt;0.005) in the high-BNP group than in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-BNP group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the components of HRV, and the early and delayed myocardial uptake of (123)I-MIBG and percentage washout rate of (123)I-MIBG were not significantly different between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The plasma level of BNP negatively correlated with BRS (r=0.35, p=0.049) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that increased plasma BNP levels were related to cardiac reflex parasympathetic dysfunction in our Japanese type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
