<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It mediates its insulin-sensitising and anti-atherogenic effects on target tissues through two known receptors, adiponectin receptors 1 and 2 (ADIPOR1; ADIPOR2), which are encoded by the genes ADIPOR1 and ADIPOR2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to study the association of ADIPOR1 gene variations with body size and risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo>, who participated in the Finnish <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Prevention Study (DPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We selected seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the ADIPOR1 gene to perform association studies with anthropometrics and metabolic parameters at baseline, and with the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during the 3-year follow-up in the DPS study population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both single SNP analysis and haplotype effects were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three out of seven markers studied (rs10920534, rs22757538 and rs1342387) were significantly associated with various body size measurements including weight, height, waist and hip circumference, sagittal diameter and body mass index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, three markers (rs10920534, rs12045862 and rs7539542), of which two were different from those associating with body size, were linked to fasting and 2-h insulin levels, particularly in men at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The haplotype analysis with five markers revealed seven major haplotypes in the DPS study population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The haplotype effects on body size measures were in line with those of single SNP analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, none of the markers were associated with the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that ADIPOR1 has a putative role in the development of body size, and that traits for central <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> may be dissociated from each other </plain></SENT>
