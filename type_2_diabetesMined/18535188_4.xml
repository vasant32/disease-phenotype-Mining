<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Study participants included 359 African Americans with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from Baltimore, Maryland, enrolled in Project Sugar 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants underwent an interview-administrated questionnaire that asked about family history, sociodemographics, clinical characteristics, and knowledge and perception of adequate glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Regression analysis was used to determine the association between parental history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and glycemic control, as measured by A1C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the comparisons between participants with and without a parental history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, those with a positive parental history tended to be younger, have higher <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, and have higher blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels before calling a doctor (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After adjustments for age, sex, and BMI, there was a significant association (P = 0.02) between A1C and parental history with the mean A1C difference between those with a positive and a negative parental history being 0.58% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, after adjustment for duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the association was no longer significant (P = 0.11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, there was a tendency for individuals with two diabetic parents to have higher A1C (P = 0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: From these results, we conclude that among the urban African American participants who were aware of their parental history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, a positive parental history was associated with worse glycemic control, partly due to longer duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Parental history did not appear to be associated with better knowledge or perception of adequate glycemic control </plain></SENT>
