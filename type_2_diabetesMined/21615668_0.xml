<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Muscle and adipose tissue samples were obtained before and after 4-weeks of exercise training in seven patients with T2D [47 ± 2 years, body mass index (BMI) 28 ± 2] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seven control subjects (54 ± 4, BMI 30 ± 2) were recruited for baseline comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adipose tissue GLUT4 protein expression was 43% lower (p &lt; 0.05) in patients with T2D compared with control subjects and exercise training increased (p &lt; 0.05) adipose tissue GLUT4 expression by 36% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Skeletal muscle GLUT4 protein expression was not different between control subjects and patients with T2D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Exercise training increased (p &lt; 0.05) skeletal muscle GLUT4 protein expression by 20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, 4-weeks of exercise training increased GLUT4 expression in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle of patients with T2D, although the functional benefits of this adaptation appear to be dependent on an optimal β-cell function </plain></SENT>
