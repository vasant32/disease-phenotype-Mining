<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> is closely associated with muscle <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and is a major risk factor for the pathogenesis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Regular physical activity not only prevents <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, but also considerably improves insulin sensitivity and skeletal muscle metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to establish and characterise an in vitro model of human skeletal muscle contraction, with a view to directly studying the signalling pathways and mechanisms that are involved in the beneficial effects of muscle activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Contracting human skeletal muscle cell cultures were established by applying electrical pulse stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, skeletal muscle cells were incubated with human adipocyte-derived conditioned medium, monocyte chemotactic protein (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>)-1 and chemerin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Similarly to in exercising skeletal muscle in vivo, electrical pulse stimulation induced contractile activity in human skeletal muscle cells, combined with the formation of sarcomeres, activation of <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and <z:mp ids='MP_0008705'>increased IL-6 secretion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake was substantially elevated in contracting cells compared with control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incubation of skeletal muscle cells with adipocyte-conditioned media, chemerin and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 significantly reduced the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This effect was abrogated by concomitant pulse stimulation of the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additionally, pro-inflammatory signalling by adipocyte-derived factors was completely prevented by electrical pulse stimulation of the myotubes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We showed that the effects of electrical pulse stimulation on skeletal muscle cells were similar to the effect of exercise on skeletal muscle in vivo in terms of enhanced AMPK activation and IL-6 secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In our model, muscle contractile activity eliminates <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> by blocking pro-inflammatory signalling pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This novel model therefore provides a unique tool for investigating the molecular mechanisms that mediate the beneficial effects of muscle contraction </plain></SENT>
