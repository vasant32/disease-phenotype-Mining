<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to investigate whether serum zinc level predicts <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> (CHD) events in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The original study population consisted of 1,059 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, aged 45-64 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum zinc values were available from 1,050 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CHD mortality and the incidence of nonfatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) were assessed in a 7-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the follow-up, 156 patients died from CHD and 254 patients had a fatal or nonfatal MI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with serum zinc concentration &lt; or = 14.1 micromol/l at baseline had a higher risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from CHD than patients with serum zinc level &gt; 14.1 micromol/l (20.8 and 12.8%, respectively; P = 0.001) The risks for fatal or nonfatal MI were 30.5 and 22.0%, respectively (P = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In Cox regression analyses, low serum zinc concentration was significantly associated with CHD mortality (relative risk [RR] 1.7, P = 0.002) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> CHD events (RR 1.37, P = 0.030), even after adjustment for confounding variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this large cohort of type 2 diabetic patients, low serum zinc level was an independent risk factor for CHD events </plain></SENT>
