<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Populations at risk for AD show altered brain activity in the default mode network (DMN) before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated this brain pattern in T2DM patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared T2DM patients (n = 10, age = 56 ± 2.2 years, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> [FPG] = 8.4 ± 1.3 mmol/L, HbA(1c) = 7.5 ± 0.54%) with nondiabetic age-matched control subjects (n = 11, age = 54 ± 1.8 years, FPG = 4.8 ± 0.2 mmol/L) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate functional connectivity strength among DMN regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also evaluated hippocampal volume, cognition, and insulin sensitivity by homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-IR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Control subjects showed stronger correlations versus T2DM patients in the DMN between the seed (posterior cingulate) and bilateral middle temporal gyrus (β = 0.67 vs. 0.43), the right inferior and left medial frontal gyri (β = 0.75 vs. 0.54), and the left thalamus (β = 0.59 vs. 0.37), respectively, with no group differences in cognition or hippocampal size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In T2DM patients, HOMA-IR was inversely correlated with functional connectivity in the right inferior frontal gyrus and precuneus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>T2DM patients showed reduced functional connectivity in the DMN compared with control subjects, which was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in selected brain regions, but there were no group effects of brain structure or cognition </plain></SENT>
