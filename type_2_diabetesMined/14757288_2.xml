<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the correlations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c) (HbA(1c)) with each plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (PG) level obtained at 0 (the same day), 1 and 2 month(s) prior to HbA(1c) determination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data were from glycemic profiles of four patients of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> treated with tablets whose HbA(1c) and pre- and post-breakfast PG levels were monitored each month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the correlation coefficients in cases 1 and 2, who presented with linear glycemic time courses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, HbA(1c) correlated with 1-month-earlier pre-breakfast PG level more strongly than 2-month-earlier post-breakfast PG level in cases 3 and 4, and than same-day post-breakfast PG level in case 3 (P&lt;0.05, ANOVA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cases 3 and 4 presented with fluctuating glycemic time courses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Samples were separated into upslope's and downslope's sections according to HbA(1c) fluctuation in the latter two cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reflecting around the 1-month lag between HbA(1c) and PG, the two sections' regression lines for PG versus HbA(1c) corresponded in the only samples related to 1-month-earlier pre- and post-breakfast PG (t-test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, it appears that pre- and post-breakfast PG levels are the most reliable predictors of 1-month-later HbA(1c) in type 2 diabetic outpatients who undergo medical examinations every month </plain></SENT>
