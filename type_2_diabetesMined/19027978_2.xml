<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The use of continuous sub-cutaneous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring (CGM) systems provides an answer for at least some of the inadequacies attributed to point capillary SMBG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The use of CGM adds information on postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excursions, nocturnal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> not previously detected by SMBG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This added information facilitates the tailoring of treatment regimens to the individual patient in order to achieve treatment targets without incurring an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> and provides a useful tool for patient self-management education </plain></SENT>
