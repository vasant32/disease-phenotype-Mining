<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Abnormal vasomotor responses to chemoreflex activation may contribute to the acceleration of atherosclerotic <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> complications, but these responses have not previously been investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We measured forearm mean blood flow (MBF) and mean vascular conductance (MVC) responses to isocapnic <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> in seven healthy and eight type 2 diabetic subjects during local intra-arterial saline infusion and alpha-adrenergic blockade (phentolamine) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effects of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> on saline and phentolamine responses significantly differed between groups; relative to normoxia, the %DeltaMVC with <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> during saline was -3.3 +/- 11.2% in control and 24.8 +/- 13.3% in diabetic subjects, whereas phentolamine increased hypoxic %DeltaMVC to similar levels (39.4 +/- 9.7% in control subjects and 48.0 +/- 11.8% in diabetic subjects, P &lt; 0.05, two-way ANOVA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Absolute normoxic MBF responses during saline infusion were 91.9 +/- 21.1 and 77.9 +/- 15.3 in control and diabetic subjects, respectively, and phentolamine increased normoxic MBF to similar levels (165.2 +/- 40.1 ml/min in control subjects and 175.9 +/- 32.0 ml/min in diabetic subjects; both P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that diabetic and control subjects exhibit similar responses to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> in the presence of alpha-adrenergic blockade despite evidence of exaggerated alpha-mediated vasoconstriction at rest </plain></SENT>
