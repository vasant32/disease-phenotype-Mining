<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether circulating metabolic intermediates are related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta-cell dysfunction</z:hpo> in individuals at risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In 73 sedentary, overweight to <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, dyslipidemic individuals, insulin action was derived from a frequently sampled intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasma concentrations of 75 amino acids, acylcarnitines, free fatty acids, and conventional metabolites were measured with a targeted, mass spectrometry-based platform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Principal components analysis followed by backward stepwise linear regression was used to explore relationships between measures of insulin action and metabolic intermediates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 75 metabolic intermediates clustered into 19 factors comprising biologically related intermediates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A factor containing large neutral amino acids was inversely related to insulin sensitivity (S(I)) (R(2) = 0.26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A factor containing fatty acids was inversely related to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (R(2) = 0.12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both of these factors, age, and a factor containing medium-chain acylcarnitines and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> were inversely and independently related to the disposition index (DI) (R(2) = 0.39) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sex differences were found for metabolic predictors of S(I) and DI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In addition to the well-recognized risks for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, elevated concentrations of large, neutral amino acids were independently associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Fatty acids were inversely related to the pancreatic response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Both large neutral amino acids and fatty acids were related to an appropriate pancreatic response, suggesting that these metabolic intermediates might play a role in the progression to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, one by contributing to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and the other to pancreatic failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These intermediates might exert sex-specific effects on insulin action </plain></SENT>
