<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Recent genome-wide association studies have identified six novel genes for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and confirmed TCF7L2 as the major type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> gene to date in Europeans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the implications of these genes in Asians are unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 13 associated single nucleotide polymorphisms from these genes in 3,041 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 3,678 control subjects of Asian ancestry from Hong Kong and Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We confirmed the associations of TCF7L2, SLC30A8, HHEX, CDKAL1, CDKN2A/CDKN2B, IGF2BP2, and FTO with risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, with odds ratios ranging from 1.13 to 1.35 (1.3 x 10(-12) &lt; P(unadjusted) &lt; 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, the A allele of rs8050136 at FTO was associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0006087'>increased BMI</z:mp> in the control subjects (P(unadjusted) = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, we did not observe significant association of any genetic variants with surrogate measures of insulin secretion or insulin sensitivity indexes in a subset of 2,662 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with subjects carrying zero, one, or two risk alleles, each additional risk allele was associated with 17% increased risk, and there was an up to 3.3-fold increased risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in those carrying eight or more risk alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite most of the effect sizes being similar between Asians and Europeans in the meta-analyses, the ethnic differences in risk allele frequencies in most of these genes lead to variable attributable risks in these two populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the important but differential contribution of these genetic variants to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in Asians compared with Europeans </plain></SENT>
