<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In older patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairments</z:hpo> are more pronounced, which might be due to age but also to differential effects of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study therefore assessed cognitive performance and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain in older type 1 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty type 1 diabetic patients (age &gt;50 years) and 40 age-matched control subjects were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neuropsychological assessment included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> major cognitive domains, and psychological well-being was assessed with questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>Atrophy</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002500'>white-matter abnormalities</z:hpo>, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were rated on MRI scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Type 1 diabetic patients performed slightly (effect sizes &lt;0.4) worse on cognitive tasks, but only "speed of information processing" reached statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant between-group differences were found on any of the MRI parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Type 1 diabetic patients tended to report more cognitive and depressive problems than control subjects, but this did not correlate with the performance on cognitive tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that cognition in older type 1 diabetic patients is only mildly disturbed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> exposure to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> is in itself, even at older age, apparently not sufficient to have considerable impact on the brain </plain></SENT>
