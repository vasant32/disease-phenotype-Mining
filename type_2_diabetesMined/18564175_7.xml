<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Vasopeptidase inhibitors are drugs that inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme and neutral endopeptidase (NEP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The latter is a protease that degrades vasoactive <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> and is increased in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that treating <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi>-induced diabetic rats, an animal model of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, with AVE7688, a vasopeptidase inhibitor, improves neurovascular and neural function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we determined the effect of treating <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats, an animal model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, with AVE7688 on vascular and neural function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: ZDF rats at 12 weeks of age were treated for 12 weeks with AVE7688 (500 mg/kg diet) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Afterwards, vascular reactivity of epineurial arterioles of the sciatic nerve and nerve conduction velocity and blood flow was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Vascular and neural function was significantly impaired in ZDF rats compared with age-matched lean (control) rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treating ZDF rats with AVE7688 improved vascular relaxation to <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> and calcitonin gene-related <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> in epineurial arterioles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Motor and sensory nerve conduction velocity, endoneurial blood flow and thermal nociception end-points were also improved by treatment compared with untreated ZDF rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">Superoxide</z:chebi> and expression of NEP were increased in epineurial arterioles from ZDF rats and attenuated by treatment with AVE7688 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: AVE7688 is an effective treatment for microvascular and neural disease in ZDF rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, vasopeptidase inhibitors may be an effective treatment for diabetic microvascular and neural complication in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
