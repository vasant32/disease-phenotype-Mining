<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, when glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA1c) remains elevated because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011998'>postprandial hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, the next therapeutic step is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the efficacy and safety of lixisenatide in patients with HbA1c still elevated after initiation of insulin glargine.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSThis double-blind, parallel-group trial enrolled patients with HbA1c 7-10% despite oral therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Insulin glargine was added and systematically titrated during a 12-week run-in, after which candidates with fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> ≤7.8 mmol/L and HbA1c 7-9% were randomized to lixisenatide 20 µg or placebo for 24 weeks while insulin titration continued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was HbA1c change after randomization.RESULTSThe randomized population (n = 446) had mean <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration of 9.2 years, BMI 31.8 kg/m(2), and daily glargine dosage of 44 units </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HbA1c had decreased during run-in from 8.6 to 7.6%; adding lixisenatide further reduced HbA1c by 0.71 vs. 0.40% with placebo (least squares mean difference, -0.32%; 95% CI, -0.46 to -0.17; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More participants attained HbA1c &lt;7% with lixisenatide (56 vs. 39%; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lixisenatide reduced plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> 2 h after a standardized breakfast (difference vs. placebo -3.2 mmol/L; P &lt; 0.0001) and had a favorable effect on body weight (difference vs. placebo -0.89 kg; P = 0.0012) </plain></SENT>
