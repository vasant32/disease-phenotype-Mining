<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The reason why <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals have low circulating SHBG has been attributed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo>, but no mechanistic evidence has been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the current study is to explore whether <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-α (TNF-α) rather than insulin could be the main factor accounting for low SHBG levels in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed in vitro and in vivo studies using human HepG2 cells and human SHBG transgenic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, a cross-sectional study to explore the relationship between TNF-α and SHBG in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients and an interventional study to examine the effect of insulin administration on circulating SHBG in type 2 diabetic patients were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We provide evidence that TNF-α, but not insulin, is the main factor by which SHBG is reduced in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma SHBG was significantly increased rather than decreased after insulin treatment in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TNF-α-induced reduction of SHBG expression was mediated by downregulating HNF4A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, a negative and independent correlation was found between plasma TNF-α receptor 1 and SHBG levels in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that TNF-α plays an important role downregulating SHBG in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> low-grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory diseases</z:e> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
