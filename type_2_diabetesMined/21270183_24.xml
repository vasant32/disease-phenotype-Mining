<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This 12-month, prospective, cluster-randomized, multicenter study recruited 483 poorly controlled (A1C ≥ 7.5%), insulin-naïve type 2 diabetic subjects from 34 primary care practices in the U.S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Practices were randomized to an active control group (ACG) with enhanced usual care or a structured testing group (STG) with enhanced usual care and at least quarterly use of structured self-monitoring of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (SMBG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STG patients and physicians were trained to use a paper tool to collect/interpret 7-point <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> profiles over 3 consecutive days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was A1C level measured at 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 12-month intent-to-treat analysis (ACG, n = 227; STG, n = 256) showed significantly greater reductions in mean (SE) A1C in the STG compared with the ACG: -1.2% (0.09) vs. -0.9% (0.10); Δ = -0.3%; P = 0.04 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Per protocol analysis (ACG, n = 161; STG, n = 130) showed even greater mean (SE) A1C reductions in the STG compared with the ACG: -1.3% (0.11) vs. -0.8% (0.11); Δ = -0.5%; P &lt; 0.003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significantly more STG patients received a treatment change recommendation at the month 1 visit compared with ACG patients, regardless of the patient's initial baseline A1C level: 179 (75.5%) vs. 61 (28.0%); &lt;0.0001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both STG and ACG patients displayed significant (P &lt; 0.0001) improvements in general well-being (GWB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Appropriate use of structured SMBG significantly improves glycemic control and facilitates more timely/aggressive treatment changes in noninsulin-treated type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> without decreasing GWB </plain></SENT>
