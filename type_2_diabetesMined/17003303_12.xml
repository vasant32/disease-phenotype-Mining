<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate how time since diagnosis and treatment intensity influence psychological outcomes in patients with screen-detected type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A 2 x 2 factorial cross-sectional design was used to examine psychological outcomes in 196 patients with screen-detected <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosed 3-33 months previously who were receiving usual care or intensive multifactorial pharmacological treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Outcomes included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related distress, perceived seriousness and vulnerability, self-efficacy, and self-care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis was used to examine variations in outcomes based on time since diagnosis (&lt;1 vs. 2-3 years) and treatment intensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Most patients reported little distress, low perceived seriousness and vulnerability, high self-efficacy, and low self-care, but outcomes varied considerably across conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Time effects were found for perceived vulnerability, which increases significantly with time since diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Time x treatment interactions were found for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related distress, and self-efficacy; notably, intensively treated patients showed more distress and less self-efficacy in the 1st year, and usual-care patients reported more distress and less self-efficacy 2-3 years after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Screen-detected patients generally do not experience much difficulty with their condition in the first few years, but early and intensive treatment can influence patients' psychological outcomes, leading to relatively more <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and less self-efficacy in the 1st year after diagnosis but not necessarily improving self-care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This suggests that intensive treatments confront patients with their <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> earlier on whereas milder treatments may delay confrontation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This finding should be taken into account in the development and timing of psychological interventions for patients with newly diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
