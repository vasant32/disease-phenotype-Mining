<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter, dose-ranging study in 451 subjects randomized to canagliflozin 50, 100, 200, or 300 mg once daily (QD) or 300 mg twice daily (BID), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> 100 mg QD, or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Primary end point was change in A1C from baseline through week 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Secondary end points included change in fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG), body weight, and overnight urinary <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-to-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Safety and tolerability were also assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Canagliflozin was associated with significant reductions in A1C from baseline (7.6-8.0%) to week 12: -0.79, -0.76, -0.70, -0.92, and -0.95% for canagliflozin 50, 100, 200, 300 mg QD and 300 mg BID, respectively, versus -0.22% for placebo (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.001) and -0.74% for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FPG was reduced by -16 to -27 mg/dL, and body weight was reduced by -2.3 to -3.4%, with significant increases in urinary <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-to-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adverse events were transient, mild to moderate, and balanced across arms except for a non-dose-dependent increase in symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0729552" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genital infections</z:e> with canagliflozin (3-8%) versus placebo and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> (2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000010'>Urinary tract infections</z:hpo> were reported without dose dependency in 3-9% of canagliflozin, 6% of placebo, and 2% of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> was low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Canagliflozin added onto <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> significantly improved glycemic control in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and was associated with low incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> and significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The safety/tolerability profile of canagliflozin was favorable except for increased frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0729552" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genital infections</z:e> in females </plain></SENT>
