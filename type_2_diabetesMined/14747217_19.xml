<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> has decreased during the past 20 years, especially in black women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies of factors associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> in preadolescent and adolescent populations are essential to understanding <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Growth and Health Study (NGHS) is a 10-year cohort study of the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in black and white girls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two NGHS centers examined the associations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, puberty, and race with fasting insulin, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-IR; a calculated index of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>) measures at 9-10 years of age (baseline) and 10 years later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Black girls had greater baseline and year-10 BMI than white girls, with a greater 10-year incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BMI-insulin correlations were positive in both black and white girls at both visits, but insulin remained higher in black girls after controlling for BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In black girls, insulin and HOMA-IR were higher in the prepubertal period (before the emergence of racial differences in BMI), increased more during puberty, and decreased less with its completion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Baseline BMI predicted year-10 glucose and the development of impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (IFG) in black girls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In white girls, the rate of BMI increase during follow-up predicted these outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 10-year incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in black girls was 1.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Black-white differences in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> are not just a consequence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, but precede the pubertal divergence in BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The development of IFG appears to be a function of the rate of increase of BMI in white girls and early <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in black girls </plain></SENT>
