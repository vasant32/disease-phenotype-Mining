<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Several large prospective studies have shown that baseline levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) are an independent predictor of cardiovascular events among apparently healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, prospective data on whether CRP predicts cardiovascular events in diabetic patients are limited so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: To investigate the association between plasma CRP levels and incidence of cardiovascular events among men with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we followed prospectively a cohort of 746 American men aged 46-81 years who were free of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> at the time of blood collection in 1993-1994 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During an average of 5 years of follow-up (3,986 person-years), we identified 103 incident cardiovascular events (18 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, 70 coronary artery bypass grafting or angioplasty, and 15 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>), confirmed by medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for age, BMI, smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e>, history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002842'>high blood pressure</z:mp>, history of high serum cholesterol, aspirin use, and fasting status as well as for fibrinogen, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, HbA(1c), and non-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> levels, CRP remained significantly associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relative risks for quartiles were 1.00, 1.51, 2.52, and 2.62 (95% CI: 1.29-5.32; P for trend: 0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We observed no effect modifications by plasma levels of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, non-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B, HbA(1c), and fibrinogen or by BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High plasma levels of CRP were associated with an increased risk of incident cardiovascular events among diabetic men, independent of currently established lifestyle risk factors, blood <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, and glycemic control </plain></SENT>
