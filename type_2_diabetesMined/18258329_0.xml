<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite the good correlation between HbA(1c) and MBG, one-third of the patients had consistently higher HbA(1c) or lower HbA(1c) levels than that expected under the hypothesis that HbA(1c) is solely determined by MBG, suggesting the existence of different <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> glycation phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The use of HbA(1c) alone for glycemic control monitoring in these patients could be insufficient to clearly trace their risk of complications </plain></SENT>
