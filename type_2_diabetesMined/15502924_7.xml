<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study population included 2924 Japanese male office workers aged 35 to 59 years who did not have IFG (fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level 6.1-6.9 mmol/l), type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level &gt; or =7.0 mmol/l and/or medication for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) or a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, and were not receiving medication for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 1-day activity record during an ordinary weekday was used to estimate daily energy expenditure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were measured at annual health examinations performed in May from 1994 to 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over a 7-year follow-up period the relative risk of IFG and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> decreased with increasing daily energy expenditure after controlling for potential predictors of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (p&lt;0.001 and p=0.001 for trend respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The age-adjusted relative risk of IFG or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> decreased with increasing energy expenditure on occupational physical activity, brisk walking, riding on vehicles (standing position) to and from work and other physical activities (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p&lt;0.001 for trend) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The association with riding on vehicles (standing position) and other physical activities remained after controlling for other potential confounders of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (p=0.026 and p=0.003 for trend respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results of stratified analyses by the presence or absence of different risk factors for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> revealed that the risk of IFG or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was inversely related to daily energy expenditure both in men at low risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and those at high risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Physical activity in daily life is inversely associated with the risk of developing IFG or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
