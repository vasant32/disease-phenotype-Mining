<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to examine physician management of patients with type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> residing in extended-care facilities and to compare this management with <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> standards of care for the outpatient adult </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was monitored in 98% of the subjects, and 38% met <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> goals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A1C goal was achieved in 67% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure was monitored in 94% of patients, with 55% meeting goal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one percent of patients had yearly <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> checked, 37% had annual electrocardiograms, 7% had urine analyzed for <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp>, 42% were on aspirin, 87% received foot exams, 42% received dilated eye exams, 89% received <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021400" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FLU">influenza</z:e> vaccinations, and 46% received pneumoccocal vaccinations </plain></SENT>
