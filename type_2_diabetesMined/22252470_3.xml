<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Healthy sedentary <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> controls (Ob; n = 6; mean±<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e> age 39.5 ± 2.3 years; mean ± <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e> BMI 33.3 ± 1.4 kg/m(2)), individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2D; n = 6; age 44 ± 1.8 years; BMI 30.1 ± 2.3 kg/m(2)), and lean endurance-trained athletes (Ath; n = 10; age 35.4 ± 3.1 years; BMI 23.3 ± 0.8 kg/m(2)) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity was determined using an IVGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Muscle biopsy specimens were taken after an overnight fast, fractionated using ultracentrifugation, and DAG species measured using liquid chromatography/MS/MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Total muscle DAG concentration was higher in the Ob (mean ± <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e> 13.3 ± 1.0 pmol/μg protein) and T2D (15.2 ± 1.0 pmol/μg protein) groups than the Ath group (10.0 ± 0.78 pmol/μg protein, p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The majority (76-86%) DAG was localised in the membrane fraction for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups, but was lowest in the Ath group (Ob, 86.2 ± 0.98%; T2D, 84.2 ± 1.2%; Ath, 75.9 ± 2.7%; p = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in cytoplasmic DAG species (p &gt; 0.12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Membrane DAG species <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28842">C18:0</z:chebi>/C20:4, Di-C16:0 and Di-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28842">C18:0</z:chebi> were significantly more abundant in the T2D group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cytosolic DAG species were negatively related to activation of protein kinase C (PKC)ε but not PKCθ, whereas membrane DAG species were positively related to activation of PKCε, but not PKCθ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only total membrane DAG (r = -0.624, p = 0.003) and Di-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28842">C18:0</z:chebi> (r = -0.595, p = 0.004) correlated with insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Disaturated DAG species were significantly lower in the Ath group (p = 0.001), and significantly related to insulin sensitivity (r = -0.642, p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These data indicate that both cellular localisation and composition of DAG influence the relationship to insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that only saturated DAG in skeletal muscle membranes are related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in humans </plain></SENT>
