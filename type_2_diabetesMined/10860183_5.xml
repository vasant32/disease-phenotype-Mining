<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Body weight and the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> are rising so rapidly in many countries that the World Health Organization has recognized that there is a "global epidemic of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>." The prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is rising in parallel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In view of its associated cardiovascular complications, we are facing a severe public health problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have a combined genetic and environmental background, but the epidemic must be due to major changes in the environment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By definition, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> is a result of a positive energy balance, which usually amounts to a tiny proportion of the total energy turnover </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Energy intake, energy expenditure, and energy accumulation (as fat) may <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> be primarily disturbed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There is a great, and still insufficiently understood, variation in prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and in the rate of change of the prevalence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevailing contention is that the epidemic is due to the changes in the society--the so-called modernization--leading to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1257763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">overnutrition</z:e> and a sedentary life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These factors are likely contributors, but it has been difficult to provide consistent evidence for their effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In Denmark, a steep rise has taken place in the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> among schoolboys and young men in two phases linked to the birth cohorts of the 1940s and of the mid-1960s and later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This rise suggests that environmental influences operating early in life are involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, a global <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> epidemic is developing, but the causes of the epidemic are not yet clear and more research is needed to establish the grounds for prevention </plain></SENT>
