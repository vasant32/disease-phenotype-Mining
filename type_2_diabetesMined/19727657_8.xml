<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Polymorphisms of the resistin gene (RETN) have been shown to affect the plasma resistin concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to identify polymorphisms of RETN that influence plasma resistin concentration and to clarify the relation between plasma resistin level and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disorders</z:e> in an aged Japanese cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study participants comprised 3133 individuals recruited to a population-based prospective cohort study (KING study) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma resistin concentration, BMI, abdominal circumference, blood pressure, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and serum insulin concentrations, HbA(1c) content and serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile were measured in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The HOMA index of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-IR) was also calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eleven polymorphisms of RETN were genotyped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A combination of ANOVA and multiple linear regression analysis in screening and large-scale subsets of the study population revealed that plasma resistin concentration was significantly associated with rs34861192 and rs3745368 polymorphisms of RETN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multiple linear regression analysis with adjustment for age and sex also showed that the plasma resistin level was significantly associated with serum concentrations of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi>, triacylglycerol and insulin, as well as with BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our results implicate the rs34861192 and rs3745368 polymorphisms of RETN as robust and independent determinants of plasma resistin concentration in the study population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, plasma resistin level was associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidaemia</z:e>, serum insulin concentration and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
