<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used longitudinal data from (1) 1,280 type 2 diabetic participants in the observational Fremantle <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study (FDS) who reported SMBG and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treatment status at study entry (1993-1996), and (2) a subset of 531 participants who attended six or more annual assessments (referred to as the 5-year cohort) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp>-related morbidity, cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality were ascertained at each assessment, supplemented by linkage to the Western Australian Data Linkage System </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, 70.2% (898 out of 1,280) of type 2 patients used SMBG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During 12,491 patient-years of follow-up (mean 9.8+/-3.5 years), 486 (38.0%) type 2 participants died (196 [15.3%] from cardiac causes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SMBG was significantly less prevalent in those who died during follow-up than in those who were still alive at the end of June 2006 (65.4 vs 73.0%, p=0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In Cox proportional hazards modelling, after adjustment for confounding and explanatory variables, SMBG was not independently associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality, but was associated with a 79% increased risk of cardiovascular mortality in patients not treated with insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For the 5-year cohort, time-dependent SMBG was independently associated with a 48% reduced risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: SMBG was not independently associated with improved survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Inconsistent findings relating to the association of SMBG with cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> may be due to confounding, incomplete covariate adjustment or chance </plain></SENT>
