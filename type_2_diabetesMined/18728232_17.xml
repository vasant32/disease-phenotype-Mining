<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Insulin-resistant macrophages are more susceptible to endoplasmic reticulum stress-associated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> probably contributing to macrophage <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and necrotic core formation in atherosclerotic plaques in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the molecular mechanisms of <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> in insulin-resistant macrophages remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The studies were performed in insulin-resistant macrophages isolated from insulin receptor knockout or ob/ob mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gain- or loss-of-function approaches were used to evaluate the roles of forkhead transcription factors (FoxOs) in endoplasmic reticulum stress-associated macrophage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Insulin-resistant macrophages showed attenuated Akt activation and increased nuclear localization of FoxO1 during endoplasmic reticulum stress induced by free cholesterol loading </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of active FoxO1 or FoxO3 failed to induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in unchallenged macrophages but exacerbated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in macrophages with an active endoplasmic reticulum stress response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conversely, macrophages with genetic knockouts of FoxO1, -3, and -4 were resistant to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in response to endoplasmic reticulum stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FoxO1 was shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation and promoter expression analysis to induce inhibitor of kappaBepsilon gene expression and thereby to attenuate the increase of nuclear p65 and nuclear factor-kappaB activity during endoplasmic reticulum stress, with proapoptotic and anti-inflammatory consequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Decreased Akt and increased FoxO transcription factor activity during the endoplasmic reticulum stress response leads to <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> of insulin-resistant macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>FoxOs may have a dual cellular function, resulting in either proapoptotic or anti-inflammatory effects in an endoplasmic reticulum stress-modulated manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the complex plaque milieu, the ultimate effect is likely to be an increase in macrophage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, plaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, and destabilization </plain></SENT>
