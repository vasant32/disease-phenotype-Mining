<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we show that pancreas-specific knockout of growth factor receptor-binding protein 10 (Grb10), which is highly expressed in pancreas and islets, leads to elevated insulin/IGF-1 signaling in islets, enhanced β-cell mass and insulin content, and <z:mp ids='MP_0003058'>increased insulin secretion</z:mp> in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pancreas-specific disruption of Grb10 expression also <z:mp ids='MP_0005292'>improved glucose tolerance</z:mp> in mice fed with a high-fat diet and protected mice from <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi>-induced β-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and body <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our study has identified Grb10 as an important regulator of β-cell proliferation and demonstrated that reducing the expression level of Grb10 could provide a novel means to increase β-cell mass and reduce β-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This is critical for effective therapeutic treatment of both type 1 and 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
