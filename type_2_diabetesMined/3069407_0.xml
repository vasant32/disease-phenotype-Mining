<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nine of the offspring were <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and 14 were non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three age-, sex- and weight-matched non-diabetic subjects without a family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were studied as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> offspring mean basal plasma immunoreactive insulin (IRI) was elevated (P less than 0.01), but the mean stimulated IRI showed no change in comparison to that of controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> offspring mean basal plasma IRI was similar, but the mean stimulated IRI was lower than that of <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> controls (P less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean specific insulin binding was decreased in both <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (P less than 0.01) and non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (P less than 0.01) offspring when compared with the respective controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Scatchard analysis of the binding data and the higher insulin concentrations required to achieve 50% inhibition of tracer binding indicated decreased receptor affinity in both <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> offspring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis by average affinity profiles also indicated decreased receptor affinity, as shown by a lower average affinity constant Kc for the empty sites, in the offspring in comparison to that of controls (P less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities in insulin binding to its receptor along with decreased affinity in the face of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance may be an early biochemical marker of potential <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in this group at high risk of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
