<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One potential mechanism is thiazolidinedione-induced arterial vasodilatation, which results in vascular leakage and a fall in blood pressure, normally counterbalanced by sympathetic activation and subsequent renal fluid retention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesised that thiazolidinedione-induced vascular leakage will be particularly prominent in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0259749" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autonomic neuropathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel study in 40 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on insulin treatment recruited from a university medical centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The randomisation was performed by a central office using a randomisation schedule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both treatment groups, placebo (n = 21) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> (n = 19), were stratified for sex and level of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0259749" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autonomic neuropathy</z:e> as assessed by Ewing score (&lt;2.5 or &gt;or=2.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effects of 16 weeks of treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> 4 mg twice daily on vascular leakage (transcapillary escape rate of albumin, TERalb), body weight, extracellular volume and plasma volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients were included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients with high Ewing scores (n = 16), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> increased TERalb significantly (DeltaTERalb: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> +2.43 +/- 0.45%/h, placebo -0.11 +/- 0.15%/h, p = 0.002), while <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> had no effect in the patients with low Ewing scores (n = 23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">Rosiglitazone</z:chebi>-induced increases in TERalb and Ewing score at baseline were correlated (r = 0.65, p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between Ewing score and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>-induced changes in fluid variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One subject was withdrawn from the study because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">Rosiglitazone</z:chebi> may increase vascular leakage in insulin-treated patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0259749" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autonomic neuropathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0259749" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Autonomic neuropathy</z:e> did not exaggerate <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>-induced fluid retention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Therefore, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0259749" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autonomic neuropathy</z:e> should be considered as a risk factor for thiazolidinedione-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo>, not for thiazolidinedione-induced fluid retention </plain></SENT>
