<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine whether <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> genetic risk testing and counseling can improve <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention behaviors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a randomized trial of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> genetic risk counseling among overweight patients at increased phenotypic risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants were randomly allocated to genetic testing versus no testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genetic risk was calculated by summing 36 single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Participants in the top and bottom score quartiles received individual genetic counseling before being enrolled with untested control participants in a 12-week, validated, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Middle-risk quartile participants were not studied further </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We examined the effect of this genetic counseling intervention on patient self-reported attitudes, program attendance, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, separately comparing higher-risk and lower-risk result recipients with control participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 108 participants enrolled in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention program included 42 participants at higher <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> genetic risk, 32 at lower <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> genetic risk, and 34 untested control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 57.9 ± 10.6 years, 61% were men, and average BMI was 34.8 kg/m(2), with no differences among randomization groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Participants attended 6.8 ± 4.3 group sessions and lost 8.5 ± 10.1 pounds, with 33 of 108 (30.6%) losing ≥5% body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were few statistically significant differences in self-reported motivation, program attendance, or mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> when higher-risk recipients and lower-risk recipients were compared with control subjects (P &gt; 0.05 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one comparison) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> genetic risk counseling with currently available variants does not significantly alter self-reported motivation or prevention program adherence for overweight individuals at risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
