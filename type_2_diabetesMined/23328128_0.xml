<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we show for the first time that with prolonged FFA exposure, islet neprilysin is upregulated and this is associated with reduced insulin pre-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and ATP levels, oxidative/nitrative stress, impaired <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> and calcium channel activities, and decreased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genetic ablation of neprilysin specifically protects against FFA-induced impairment of calcium influx and GSIS in vitro and in vivo but does not ameliorate other FFA-induced defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Importantly, adenoviral overexpression of neprilysin in islets cultured without FFA reproduces the defects in both calcium influx and GSIS, suggesting that upregulation of neprilysin per se mediates insulin secretory dysfunction and that the mechanism for protection conferred by neprilysin deletion involves prevention of reduced calcium influx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our findings highlight the critical nature of calcium signaling for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> insulin secretion and suggest that interventions to inhibit neprilysin may improve Î²-cell function in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> humans with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
