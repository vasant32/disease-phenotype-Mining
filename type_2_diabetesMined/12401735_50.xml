<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare guidelines on <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from different countries in order to examine whether differences in recommendations could be explained by use of different research evidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed 15 clinical guidelines on type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from 13 countries using qualitative methods to compare the recommendations and bibliometric methods to measure the extent of overlap in citations used by different guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A further qualitative analysis of recommendations and cited evidence for two specific issues in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care explored the apparent discrepancy between recommendations and evidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The recommendations made in the guidelines were in agreement about the general management of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, with some important differences in treatment details </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was little overlap in evidence cited by the guidelines, with 18% (185/1,033) of citations shared with any other guideline, and only 10 studies (1%) appearing in six or more guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The measurable overlap in evidence between guidelines increases if multiple publications from the same study and the use of reviews are taken into account </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Research originating from the U.S. predominated (40% of citations); however, nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> (11/12) guidelines were significantly more likely to cite evidence originating from their own countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite the variation in cited evidence and preferential citation of evidence from a guideline's country of origin, we found a high degree of international consensus in recommendations made for the clinical care of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The influence of professional bodies such as the American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association may be an important factor in explaining international consensus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Globalization of recommended management of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is not a simple consequence of the globalization of research evidence </plain></SENT>
