<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1993 and 1996, 1,294 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were recruited to the longitudinal, observational Fremantle <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>LEAs and mortality from cardiac causes were monitored until 30 June 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Inpatient costs (in Australian dollars in year 2000), derived using a case-mix approach, were available for the period from 1 July 1993 to 30 June 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During follow-up 44 patients without LEA at baseline had a first-ever <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related LEA, an incidence of 3.8 per 1,000 patient-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Independent predictors of first-ever LEA included foot ulceration (hazard ratio [95% CI]: 5.56 [1.24-25.01]), an ankle brachial index &lt; or =0.90 (2.21 [1.11-4.42]), HbA(1c) (increase of 1%: 1.30 [1.10-1.54]) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> (2.65 [1.30-5.44]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The risk of cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was significantly increased in patients with LEA at baseline, although this was not an independent risk factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median (interquartile range) inpatient cost per LEA admission was 12,485 Australian dollars (6,037 Australian dollars-24,415 Australian dollars), with a median length of stay of 24 (10-43) days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: First-ever LEAs in type 2 patients were associated with poor glycaemic control, foot ulceration and evidence of microvascular and macrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with LEA were at increased risk of cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>LEAs contribute disproportionately to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related inpatient costs </plain></SENT>
