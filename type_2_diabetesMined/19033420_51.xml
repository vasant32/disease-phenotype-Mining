<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its relationship to treatment adherence, however, has not been systematically reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used meta-analysis to examine the relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and treatment nonadherence in patients with type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We searched MEDLINE and PsycINFO databases for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studies published by June 2007 and reviewed references of published articles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Meta-analytic procedures were used to estimate the effect size r in a random effects model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significance values, weighted effect sizes, 95% CIs, and tests of homogeneity of variance were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Results from 47 independent samples showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> was significantly associated with nonadherence to the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treatment regimen (z = 9.97, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The weighted effect size was near the medium range (r = 0.21, 95% CI 0.17-0.25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moderator analyses showed that the effect was significantly larger in studies that measured self-care as a continuous versus categorical variable (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Effect sizes were largest for missed medical appointments and composite measures of self-care (r values = 0.31, 0.29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moderation analyses suggest that effects for most other types of self-care are also near the medium range, especially in studies with stronger methodologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate a significant association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and treatment nonadherence in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Studies that used stronger methodologies had larger effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Treatment nonadherence may represent an important pathway between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and worse <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
