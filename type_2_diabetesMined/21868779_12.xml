<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We previously showed that exenatide (EXE) enhanced insulin secretion after 1 year of treatment, relative to insulin glargine (GLAR), with a similar <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These effects were not sustained after a 4-week off-drug period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This article reports the results after additional 2 years of exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Sixty-nine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>-treated patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were randomized to EXE or GLAR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty-six patients entered the 2-year extension study in which they continued their allocated therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six completed (EXE: n = 16; GLAR: n = 20) the 3-year exposure period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity (M value) and β-cell function were measured by euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp followed by hyperglycemic clamp with arginine stimulation at pretreatment (week 52) and 4 weeks after discontinuation of study medication (week 56 and week 172) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>First-phase <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> stimulated C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> secretion was adjusted for M value and calculated as the disposition index (DI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At 3 years, EXE and GLAR resulted in similar levels of glycemic control: 6.6 ± 0.2% and 6.9 ± 0.2%, respectively (P = 0.186) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>EXE compared with GLAR significantly <z:mp ids='MP_0001262'>reduced body weight</z:mp> (-7.9 ± 1.8 kg; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After the 4-week off-drug period, EXE increased the M value by 39% (P = 0.006) while GLAR had no effect (P = 0.647) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Following the 4-week off-drug period, the DI, compared with pretreatment, increased with EXE, but decreased with GLAR (1.43 ± 0.78 and -0.99 ± 0.65, respectively; P = 0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: EXE and GLAR sustained HbA(1c) over the 3-year treatment period, while EXE <z:mp ids='MP_0001262'>reduced body weight</z:mp> and GLAR <z:hpo ids='HP_0004324'>increased body weight</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Following the 3-year treatment with EXE, the DI was sustained after a 4-week off-drug period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest a beneficial effect on β-cell health </plain></SENT>
