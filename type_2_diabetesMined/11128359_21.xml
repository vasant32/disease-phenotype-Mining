<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Fasting tHcy levels were measured in 122 type 2 diabetic patients in whom the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> complications (e.g., <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096293" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">macroangiopathy</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp>, macroproteinuria, <z:mp ids='MP_0005558'>decreased creatinine clearance</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e>) was recorded alongside an assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> by the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that 31% of the cohort (group 1) had raised tHcy (mean +/- 1 SD) values (20.8 +/- 5.1 micromol/l), whereas 69% (group 2) had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values (10.2 +/- 2.0 micromol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096293" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">macroangiopathy</z:e> was higher in group 1 than in group 2 subjects (70 vs. 42%, P &lt; 0.01); the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> was particularly higher in group 1 (46 vs. 21%, P &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>impaired renal function</z:hpo>, evidenced by <z:mp ids='MP_0005558'>decreased creatinine clearance</z:mp>, was higher in group 1 (32 vs. 10%, P &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other clinical and biological characteristics of both groups were comparable, although group 1 had lower levels of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> than group 2 (5.2 +/- 2.9 vs. 7.0 +/- 3.4 ng/ml, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No differences were found for <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> (33 vs. 31%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (45 vs. 42%), or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> (70 vs. 59%) between groups 1 and 2, respectively The degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> was similar in groups 1 and 2 (46 +/- 21 and 42 +/- 20% of HOMA-insulin sensitivity) as was the assessment of beta-cell function (63 +/- 28 and 65 +/- 46%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No differences in tHcy levels were found between subjects receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and those not receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the plasma tHcy level was higher in diabetic patients treated with fibrates (P = 0.0016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Elevated plasma tHcy levels in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is associated with a higher prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096293" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">macroangiopathy</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> when assessed from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance indexes and is not associated with different degrees of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
