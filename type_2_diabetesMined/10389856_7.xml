<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A newly identified 3'-untranslated region (UTR) polymorphism of the gene for skeletal muscle-specific <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi>-targeting subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PPP1R3) was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Pima Indians (Xia J, Scherers W, Cohen PTW, Majer M, Xi T, Norman RA, Knowler WC, Bogardus C, Prochazka M: A common variant in PP1R3 associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, we investigated the frequency of polymorphism of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16708">adenine</z:chebi>- and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17821">thymine</z:chebi>-rich element (ARE-1 and its variant ARE-2) in 426 Japanese type 2 diabetic and 380 nondiabetic subjects using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction enzyme fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The allele frequency of the ARE-2 variant in diabetic subjects was higher than that in nondiabetic subjects (0.34 vs. 0.29; P &lt; 0.05), even though its frequency in Japanese subjects was lower (P &lt; 0.001) than the reported value in Pima Indians (0.56) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> polymorphism at codon 905 was 100% coupled to the ARE-2 allele, and its allele frequency was higher also in diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although a serine substitution at codon 883 was partially linked with the ARE-2 allele, there was no difference between diabetic and nondiabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the frequency of polymorphism of the PPP1R3 gene (ARE-2 and Asp905) is different between two ethnic groups and is increased in Japanese people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, suggesting that these variants may be a possible marker for searching for diabetogenic genes </plain></SENT>
