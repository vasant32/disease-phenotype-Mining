<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We previously showed that polymorphisms of the promoter area of chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) gene (59029G/A) and its <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, regulated upon activation, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) gene (-28C/G) were new candidates for susceptibility to diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to confirm the effect of these polymorphisms on the development and progression of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a 10-year retrospective study of 191 Japanese type 2 diabetic patients with normoalbuminuria at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The subjects were classified into two groups: (1) those with persistent normoalbuminuria (group N) and (2) those with progression from normoalbuminuria to <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> or overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> (group P) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Then, their association with CCR5 59029G/A and RANTES -28C/G polymorphisms was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the RANTES -28G(+) genotype did nor differ between the two groups, but the CCR5 59029A(+) genotype had a significantly higher frequency in group P than in group N (83% versus 71%, p=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By discriminant analysis, only the CCR5 59029A(+) genotype showed an independent positive correlation with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> or progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> (p=0.03, odds ratio=2.41, 95% CI=1.09-5.33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the CCR5 59029A(+) genotype seems to be related the etiology of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in Japanese type 2 diabetics </plain></SENT>
