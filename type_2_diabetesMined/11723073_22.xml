<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mice overexpressing UCP3 in skeletal muscle showed reduced fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, <z:mp ids='MP_0005292'>improved glucose tolerance</z:mp> after an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> load, and reduced fasting plasma insulin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, data regarding the expression of UCP3 in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is inconsistent, and so far, there have been no reports of UCP3 protein content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we compared, for the first time, the protein levels of UCP3 in vastus lateralis muscle in 14 male type 2 diabetic patients (age 49.8 +/- 2.1 years; BMI 27.2 +/- 1.2 kg/m(2); mean +/- SE) with 16 male control subjects (age 48.0 +/- 1.9 years; BMI 23.4 +/- 0.6 kg/m(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that UCP3 protein levels were twice as low in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with control subjects (117 +/- 16 vs. 58 +/- 12 AU; P = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between UCP3 content and BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, UCP3 content is lower in type 2 diabetic patients compared with healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results are consistent with a role for UCP3 in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis and suggest a role for UCP3 in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
