<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> is a proinsulin cleavage product released from the pancreas in amounts equimolar to insulin, and elevated levels of C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> have been found in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and early type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent data suggest that C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> could play a causal role in the pathophysiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e>, but nothing is known about the prognostic value of C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> concentrations in the circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We examined whether C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> is associated with cardiovascular and total mortality in 2,306 patients from the Ludwigshafen Risk and Cardiovascular Health Study who underwent coronary angiography at baseline (1997-2000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS During a mean follow-up of 7.6 years, 440 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (19.1%) occurred, 252 (10.9%) of which were due to cardiovascular causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) in the third compared with the first tertile of C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> were 1.46 (95% CI 1.15-1.85; P = 0.002) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cause and 1.58 (1.15-2.18; P = 0.005) for cardiovascular mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After further adjustment for common risk factors as well as markers of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism, these HRs remained significant at 1.46 (1.10-1.93; P = 0.008) and 1.55 (1.07-2.24; P = 0.022), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, patients in higher tertiles of C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> exhibited higher levels of markers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> as well as a more severe extent of coronary lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS In patients undergoing coronary angiography, C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels are independently associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cause and cardiovascular mortality as well as presence and severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to examine a potential causal role of C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> in atherogenesis in humans </plain></SENT>
