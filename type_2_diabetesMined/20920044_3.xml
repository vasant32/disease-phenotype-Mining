<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because intensive insulin therapy (IIT) can induce normoglycaemia, we reasoned that short-term IIT could enable evaluation of the beta-cell protective capacity of OADs, free from confounding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We applied this strategy to assess the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> on beta-cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this pilot study, 37 patients with T2DM of 6.0 + 6.4 years duration and A1c 7.0 + 0.8% on 0-2 OADs were switched to 4-8 weeks of IIT consisting of basal detemir and premeal insulin aspart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects achieving fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &lt;7.0 mmol/l 1 day after completing IIT (n = 21) were then randomized to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> with either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> (n = 10) or placebo (n = 11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subjects were followed for 48 weeks, with serial assessment of beta-cell function [ratio of AUC(Cpep) to AUC(gluc) over Homeostasis Model Assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin Resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-IR) (AUC(Cpep/gluc) /HOMA-IR)] on 4-h meal tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the study, fasting glucagon-like-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 was higher (p = 0.003) and A1c lower in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> arm (p = 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, although beta-cell function improved during the IIT phase, it declined similarly in both arms over time (p = 0.61) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By study end, AUC(Cpep/gluc) /HOMA-IR was not significantly different between the placebo and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> arms (median 71.2 vs 80.4; p = 0.36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Pretreatment IIT can provide a useful strategy for evaluating the beta-cell protective capacity of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In this pilot study, improved A1c with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> could not be attributed to a significant effect on preservation of beta-cell function </plain></SENT>
