<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> on perfusion regulation and brain volumes in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 147 subjects (71 diabetic and 76 nondiabetic, aged 65.2 Â± 8 years) were studied using 3T anatomical and continuous arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analysis focused on the relationship between serum soluble vascular and intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules (sVCAM and sICAM, respectively, both markers of endothelial integrity), regional vasoreactivity, and tissue volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Diabetic subjects had greater vasoconstriction reactivity, more <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and slower walking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">Adhesion</z:e> molecules were specifically related to gray matter <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> (P = 0.04) and altered vasoreactivity (P = 0.03) in the diabetic and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Regionally, sVCAM and sICAM were linked to exaggerated vasoconstriction, blunted vasodilatation, and increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0002120'>cortical atrophy</z:hpo> in the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes (P = 0.04-0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>sICAM correlated with worse functionality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002120'>cortical atrophy</z:hpo>, vasoconstriction, and worse performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">Adhesion</z:e> molecules, as markers of vascular health, have been indicated to contribute to altered vasoregulation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
