<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Randomized controlled trial including a subsample of 1781 Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> (ACCORD) participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants received dietary counseling to consume a reduced-fat diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Outcome measures included HbA1c, fasting <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile, blood pressure, and weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Longitudinal linear regression analyses were used to evaluate relationships between baseline and follow-up PEP scores and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PEP scores decreased significantly from baseline to 12-month follow up with a mean difference of -0.09Â±0.39, P&lt;0.001 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>White race, female gender, and more hours per week of physical activity were correlated with a decline in PEP scores at 1-year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A longitudinal decrease in dietary fat intake was associated with significantly less <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> at 12- and 36-months and lower serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> at 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Reduced fat intake as measured by a brief questionnaire was associated with significant improvement in some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> and weight), but not in others </plain></SENT>
