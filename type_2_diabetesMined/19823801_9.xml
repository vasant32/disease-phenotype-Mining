<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined prospectively the relation of calcium and <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> intake to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk in a Japanese cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Participants were 59,796 middle-aged and older men and women, who participated in the Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study and had no history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or other serious diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dietary intake of calcium and <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> were estimated using a validated food frequency questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression was used to assess the association between intake of these nutrients and self-reported newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During a 5 year follow-up, 1,114 cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, calcium intake was not associated with a significantly lower risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; the multivariable odds ratio for the highest vs lowest quartiles was 0.93 (95% CI 0.71-1.22) in men and 0.76 (95% CI 0.56-1.03) in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, among participants with a higher <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> intake, calcium intake was inversely associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk; the odds ratio for the highest vs lowest intake categories was 0.62 (95% CI 0.41-0.94) in men and 0.59 (95% CI 0.38-0.91) in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Dairy food intake was significantly associated with a lower risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in women only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Calcium and <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> may not be independently associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our finding suggesting a joint action of these nutrients against type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> warrants further investigation </plain></SENT>
