<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We enrolled 7,594 Japanese men aged 35-60 years who did not have <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> at study entry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was defined as a fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level of &gt; or = 126 mg/dl or a 2-h postload plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level of &gt; or = 200 mg/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood pressure was defined as no history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and a systolic blood pressure of &gt; or = 130 and &lt; 140 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure of &gt; or = 85 and &lt; 90 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects were considered to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> if they had a systolic blood pressure &gt; or = 140 mmHg, if they had a diastolic blood pressure &gt; or = 90 mmHg, or if they were taking anti-hypertensive medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We confirmed 600 cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during the 72,946 person-years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both high <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood pressure and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> were associated with the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with normotensive men, men with high <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood pressure had a multiple adjusted relative risk (RR) of 1.39 (95% CI 1.14-1.69), and men with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> had a multiple adjusted RR of 1.76 (1.43-2.16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Even among lean men (BMI &lt; 22.7 kg/m2), men with high <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood pressure had a multiple adjusted RR of 1.71 (1.20-2.42), and men with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> had a multiple adjusted RR of 2.02 (1.34-3.05) compared with normotensive men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood pressure and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> are associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
