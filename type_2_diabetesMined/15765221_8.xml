<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We also aimed to determine the respective contributions made by 2hPG and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> to the metabolic risk profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We compared <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> and insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion by using several indices calculated using measurements obtained during an OGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects (n=643, age 18-71 years) were participants in the Quebec Family Study and were categorised according to 2hPG as having low NPG (2hPG &lt;5.6 mmol/l, the group median for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values), high NPG (2hPG 5.6-7.7 mmol/l) or IGT (2hPG 7.8-11.0 mmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were excluded from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Beta cell function and insulin sensitivity progressively decreased with increasing 2hPG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with subjects with low NPG, subjects with high NPG were more insulin-resistant (p&lt;0.05) and had <z:mp ids='MP_0003059'>reduced insulin secretion</z:mp> (adjusted for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>) (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They also had higher plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> concentrations (p&lt;0.01) and cholesterol:<z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> ratios (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These differences remained even after adjustment for age, sex, BMI and waist circumference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analyses showed that 2hPG was closely associated with risk factors for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and with cardiovascular variables, including <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (p&lt;0.0001) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These results show that deteriorations in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-insulin metabolism, which may predispose individuals to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, are already present in subjects with 2hPG concentrations within the high <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Independently of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, 2hPG was found to explain, in part, the variance observed in cardiovascular and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In addition, elevated 2hPG was associated with metabolic alterations that appear to be the most detrimental to metabolic health </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Thus, 2hPG values within the high <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range may be an important marker for the identification of people at risk of complications related to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
