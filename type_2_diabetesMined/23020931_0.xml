<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Stem cells may be able to generate new tissue and even cure diseases for which there is no adequate therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T1DM), an <z:mp ids='MP_0002056'>insulin-dependent diabetes</z:mp>, is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disease affecting genetically predisposed individuals, in which insulin-secreting beta (β)-cells within pancreatic islets of Langerhans are selectively and irreversibly destroyed by autoimmune assault </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2DM) is characterized by a gradual decrease in insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues and the liver (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>), followed by a gradual decline in β-cell function and insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Successful replacing of damaged β-cells has shown considerable potential in treating T1DM, but lack of adequate donors is a barrier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The literature suggests that embryonic and adult stem cells are promising alternatives in long-term treatment of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, any successful strategy should address both the need for β-cell replacement and controlling the <z:mp ids='MP_0001844'>autoimmune response</z:mp> to cells that express insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This review summarizes the current knowledge of options and the potential of stem cell transplantation in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treatment </plain></SENT>
