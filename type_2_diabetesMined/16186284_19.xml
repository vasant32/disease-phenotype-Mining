<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Until now, few clinical studies have reported on the association between the indexes of body fat distribution and serum ferritin, an indicator of body iron stores and a putative risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the association between serum ferritin concentrations and the indexes of distribution of adipose tissues in the body, such as the visceral fat area (VFA), the subcutaneous fat area (SFA), and the hepatic fat content in Japanese subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 248 Japanese subjects (127 men and 121 postmenopausal women aged 57.8 +/- 13.9 years, BMI 25.7 +/- 4.6 kg/m2; 140 subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 108 nondiabetic subjects) were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects with a history of alcohol intake were excluded from the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We measured body height, body weight, and serum ferritin, as well as fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and plasma insulin concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We estimated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> by homeostasis model assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The fat distribution was evaluated by measuring the VFA and SFA by abdominal computed tomography at the umbilical level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To assess the hepatic fat content, the ratio of the computed tomography attenuation value of the liver to that of the spleen was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum ferritin was significantly correlated with the various indexes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> examined, such as the hepatic fat content (r = -0.280, P &lt; 0.0001), VFA (r = 0.254, P &lt; 0.0001), SFA (r = 0.231, P = 0.0005), and homeostasis model assessment (r = 0.286, P = 0.0008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report to directly demonstrate an association between serum ferritin and VFA and SFA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results of this study suggest that the serum ferritin concentration may be a useful indicator of systemic fat content and degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
