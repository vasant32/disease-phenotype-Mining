<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Proportional hazards analyses were performed to examine the relationships between <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> subfractions and the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Pima Indian women and men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results were controlled for age, BMI, systolic blood pressure, and 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Some 54 of 123 women and 25 of 50 men developed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during a mean follow-up of 10 (2-19) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For women, in separate models, high levels of total <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>, HDL2a, and HDL3 were negatively associated with incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; results were unchanged in models further controlled for fasting insulin level or alcohol consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For men, the results were inconsistent and associated with wide confidence intervals; high total <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> and HDL3 were positively associated with incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in models further controlled for fasting insulin level, but the risk estimates were attenuated in models further controlled for alcohol consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High levels of total <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>, HDL2a, and HDL3 were potential protective factors against type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in women after accounting for alcohol consumption and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>High levels of total <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> and HDL3 were predictive of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in men; the relationship in men appeared to be due to an association with alcohol consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The sex differences in the effects of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> may be related to the effects of sex hormones or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
