<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A missense mutation in amylin at amino acid 20 from Serine to Glycine (S20G) has been shown to be associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, the frequency and clinical characteristics of the S20G mutation in Korean was examined with 364 unrelated type 2 diabetic and 151 non-diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The S20G mutation was found in seven out of 364 diabetic patients (1.92%) and in three out of 151 non-diabetic subjects (1.99%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The body mass index (BMI) of the patients with the S20G mutation was lower than those with the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> (21.2+/-1.8 vs. 24.3+/-3.0 kg/m(2); P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetic</z:e> maximum BMI was also lower in patients with the S20G mutation (22.4+/-2.3 vs. 26.4+/-3.2 kg/m(2); P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with the S20G mutation had a higher HbA(1c) level than those with the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> (9.3+/-1.4 vs. 7.7+/-1.3%; P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In summary, the frequency of the S20G mutation in the amylin gene is 1.92% in unrelated Korean type 2 diabetic patients and this mutation is associated with a lower BMI and a higher HbA(1c) level </plain></SENT>
