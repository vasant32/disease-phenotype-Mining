<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: This study investigates the role of serine/threonine protein kinase 25 (STK25), a member of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001924'>sterile</z:mp> 20 (STE20) superfamily of kinases, in the regulation of skeletal muscle metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The effect of depleting STK25 in muscle cells was studied by reducing the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein content of this target in the rat myoblast cell line L6 by small interfering (si)<z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The changes in the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels of several members of the fatty acid oxidative and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolic pathways were measured by quantitative real-time (qRT)-PCR and western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rate of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> oxidation and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake was measured after transfection with siRNA for Stk25 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of STK25 was also evaluated in skeletal muscle biopsies from 41 white Europid men and women with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> using qRT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We demonstrate that partial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of STK25 increases the expression of uncoupling protein 3 (Ucp3), accompanied by increased <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> oxidation, in myoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, a reduced level of STK25 enhances the expression of Slc2a1 (also known as Glut1), Slc2a4 (also known as Glut4) and hexokinase 2, and correspondingly, improves insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake in muscle cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Consistent with these results, significantly higher STK25 levels were observed in the skeletal muscle of type 2 diabetic patients, compared with individuals with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: This is the first study indicating a possible role for STK25 in the regulation of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism in L6 myoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This kinase appears to be an interesting new mediator to be evaluated for therapeutic intervention in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and related complications, as controlled increase in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> oxidation and insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake in skeletal muscle is favourable and can restore energy balance in metabolically compromised states </plain></SENT>
