<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore treated young, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-tolerant relatives with the insulin action enhancer <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> in order to determine the effects on insulin sensitivity, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism, and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Relatives were randomized in a double-blind manner and treated for 12 weeks with either 200 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Before and after treatment, an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) and a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp (40 mU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>m(-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>min(-1)) were performed, including 3-(3)H <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion, glycolytic flux calculations, indirect calorimetry, and muscle biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twelve relatives received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> and 12 placebo (aged 30.8 +/- 2.0 vs. 30.3 +/- 1.6 years, BMI 29.6 +/- 0.8 vs. 30.5 +/- 1.3 kg/m(2); means +/- SE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Area under the curve (AUC) for plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> at the second OGTT was unchanged after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> reduced fasting (from 70.3 +/- 6.9 to 52.2 +/- 5.8 vs. 73.6 +/- 11.0 to 73.3 +/- 6.5 pmol/l, P &lt; 0.02) and AUC plasma insulin (mean [CI] from 335.7 [230.9-488.1] to 277.4 [179.4-428.8] vs. 313.8 [218.2-451.2] to 353.9 [208.3-601.3] pmol/l, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additionally, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> were reduced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> (from 1.86 +/- 0.33 to 1.38 +/- 0.27 vs. 2.22 +/- 0.44 to 2.35 +/- 0.46 mmol/l, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal increased in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> group (from 208.3 +/- 23.7 to 263.5 +/- 30.4 vs. 197.1 +/- 20.0 to 200.8 +/- 20.8 mg </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>min(-1), P &lt; 0.02) mainly due to increased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> storage (from 99.9 +/- 17.9 to 146.0 +/- 25.3 vs. 87.1 +/- 16.7 to 87.9 +/- 15.7 mg </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-tolerant first-degree relatives, treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> improved insulin sensitivity almost 50%, primarily due to increased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> storage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the use of insulin action enhancers can be especially valuable in this group of subjects with a known high risk for developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
