<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied seven <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and seven lean and seven <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> control subjects (fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, 7.5 +/- 0.5, 4.8 +/- 0.1, and 5.2 +/- 0.1 mmol/l, respectively) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Insulin levels decreased normally during exercise in diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels decreased in diabetic subjects, but remained constant in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Basal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production was not different among groups and increased similarly during exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The decrease in plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in diabetic subjects was due to greater <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization (867 +/- 83 vs. 726 +/- 143 micromol x m(-2) x min(-1); P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This was a consequence of the mass effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, since <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolic clearance increased similarly in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> response to exercise was blunted in diabetic subjects, presumably indicating <z:hpo ids='HP_0002459'>autonomic dysfunction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, during moderate-intensity exercise in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> diabetic subjects with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, 1) insulin secretory responses were normally regulated; 2) <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis was different from that in nondiabetic subjects because <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels decreased during exercise; 3) the decrease in plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was due to greater-than-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rates of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization, which were sustained by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>; and 4) elevated basal rates of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> cycling decreased during exercise, presumably because exercise simultaneously lowered plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, was associated with a blunted <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> response, and accentuated an underlying defect in hepatic glucokinase activity in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
