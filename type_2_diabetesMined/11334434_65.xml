<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast, exercise results in a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> increase in GLUT4 translocation and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several groups have recently hypothesized that exercise increases <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake via an insulin-independent mechanism mediated by the activation of <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (AMPK) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>If this hypothesis is correct, people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> should have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> AMPK activation in response to exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and eight matched control subjects exercised on a cycle ergometer for 45 min at 70% of maximum workload </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Biopsies of vastus lateralis muscle were taken before exercise, after 20 and 45 min of exercise, and at 30 min postexercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations decreased from 7.6 to 4.77 mmol/l with 45 min of exercise in the diabetic group and did not change in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Exercise significantly increased AMPK alpha2 activity 2.7-fold over basal at 20 min in both groups and remained elevated throughout the protocol, but there was no effect of exercise on AMPK alpha1 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had similar protein expression of AMPK alpha1, alpha2, and beta1 in muscle compared with control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>AMPK alpha2 was shown to represent approximately two-thirds of the total alpha <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the muscle from both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> exercise-induced AMPK alpha2 activity and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> expression of the alpha1, alpha2 and beta1 isoforms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Pharmacological activation of AMPK may be an attractive target for the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
