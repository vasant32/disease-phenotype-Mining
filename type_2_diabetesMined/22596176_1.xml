<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Older people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are at high risk of mobility disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the association of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with lower-limb muscle mass and muscle quality to verify whether <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related muscle impairments mediate the association between <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and low walking speed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of 835 participants (65 years old and older) enrolled in the InCHIANTI (Invecchiare in Chianti, aging in the Chianti area) population-based study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Total, muscular, and fat cross-sectional areas of the calf and relative muscle density were measured using peripheral quantitative computerized tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Indicators of muscle performance included knee-extension torque, ankle plantar flexion and dorsiflexion strength, lower-extremity muscle power, and ankle muscle quality (ratio of ankle strength to the muscle area [kilograms per centimeters squared]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Gait performance was assessed by 4- and 400-m walking speed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> was ascertained by standard American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 11.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for age and sex, participants with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had lower muscle density, knee and ankle strength, and muscle power and worse muscle quality (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Diabetic participants were also slower on both 4-m (β: -0.115 ± 0.024 m/s, P &lt; 0.001) and 400-m (β:-0.053 ± 0.023 m/s, P &lt; 0.05) walking tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In multivariable linear regression models, lower-limb muscle characteristics accounted for 24.3 and 15.1% of walking speed difference comparing diabetic and nondiabetic subjects in the 4- and 400-m walks, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In older persons, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is associated with reduced muscle strength and worse muscle quality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These impairments are important contributors of walking limitations related to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
