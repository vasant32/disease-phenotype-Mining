<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of ruboxistaurin on diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, pilot study was performed to evaluate the effects of 32 mg/day ruboxistaurin for 1 year in persons (n = 123) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and persistent <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> (albumin-to-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio [ACR] 200-2,000 mg/g), despite therapy with renin-angiotensin system inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was a change in the ACR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (four-component equation from the Modification of Diet in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Renal Disease</z:e> study) was also calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, urinary ACR was 764 +/- 427 mg/g (means +/- SD), and eGFR was 70 +/- 24 ml/min per 1.73 m2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 135 +/- 14 and 75 +/- 9 mmHg, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HbA(1c) was 8.0 +/- 1.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After 1 year, urinary ACR decreased significantly (-24 +/- 9%) in participants treated with ruboxistaurin (P = 0.020) and nonsignificantly (-9 +/- 11%) in the placebo group (P = 0.430) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The ACR-lowering effect of ruboxistaurin appeared by 1 month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>eGFR did not decline significantly in the ruboxistaurin group (-2.5 +/- 1.9 ml/min per 1.73 m2) (P = 0.185), whereas the placebo group lost significant eGFR over 1 year (-4.8 +/- 1.8 ml/min per 1.73 m2) (P = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Between-group differences for changes in ACR and eGFR were not statistically significant, but this pilot study was underpowered to determine such differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In persons with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, treatment with ruboxistaurin reduced <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> and maintained eGFR over 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Ruboxistaurin may add benefit to established therapies for diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
