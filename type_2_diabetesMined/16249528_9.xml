<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Incidence of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is considered to be low in adults, but no study has been performed in Mediterranean countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We extended the study base of the registry of the province of Turin, Italy, to subjects aged 30-49 years in the period 1999-2001 to estimate the incidences of type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was based on permanent insulin treatment or a fasting C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> level &lt; or =0.20 nmol/l or islet cell (ICA) or GAD (GADA) antibody positivities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 1,135 case subjects with high completeness of ascertainment (99%), giving an incidence rate of 58.0 per 100,000 person-years (95% CI 54.7-61.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 7.3 per 100,000 person-years (6.2-8.6), comparable with the rates in subjects aged 0-14 and 15-29 years (10.3 [9.5-11.2] and 6.8 [6.3-7.4]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Male subjects had a higher risk than female subjects for both type 1 (rate ratio [RR] 1.70 [95% CI 1.21-2.38]) and type 2 (2.10 [1.84-2.40]) <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ICA and/or GADA positivities were found in 16% of the cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In logistic regression, variables independently associated with autoimmune <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were age 30-39 years (odds ratio [OR] 2.39 [95% CI 1.40-4.07]), fasting C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> &lt;0.60 nmol/l (3.09 [1.74-5.5]), and BMI &lt;26 kg/m2 (2.17 [1.22-3.85]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Risk of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> between age 30 and 49 years is similar to that found in the same area between age 15 and 29 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further studies are required to allow geographical comparisons of risks of both childhood and adulthood autoimmune <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the latter being probably higher than previously believed </plain></SENT>
