<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that lower vital capacity is cross-sectionally associated with features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and is an independent predictor of incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of vital capacity as a predictor of incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> using 9-year follow-up data on 11,479 middle-aged adults without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at baseline from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 s were measured at baseline using standard spirometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> cases were ascertained during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At baseline, low FVC (% predicted) was independently associated with indicators of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> syndrome, including higher fasting levels of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>; lower fasting <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>; and higher systolic blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In prospective analyses, there were graded associations between low FVC (% predicted) and incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These associations persisted in multivariable analyses that adjusted for age, race, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e>, smoking, physical activity, and ARIC center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with individuals in the highest quartile of FVC (% predicted), the fully adjusted hazard ratio (95% CI) of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in individuals in the lowest quartile was 1.6 (1.3-2.0) in men and 1.7 (1.3-2.1) in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These relationships were stronger in those who have never smoked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Lower vital capacity is an independent predictor of incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary factors related to vital capacity deserve attention as possible risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
