<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been hypothesized that this abnormality represents an intrinsic abnormality of the beta-cell and/or may result from an increase in beta-cell secretory demand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To address this, six patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and six age- and BMI-matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects received a combined 3-h insulin and somatostatin clamp to decrease beta-cell secretory demand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An arginine stimulation test was performed before and at the end of the clamp to measure beta-cell <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In keeping with the reduction in secretory demand, C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels were suppressed by 60-80% during the clamp, as were proinsulin (PI) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The arginine-stimulated PI/C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> ratio decreased in the diabetic subjects from 4.4 +/- 1.5% before to 1.8 +/- 0.5% after the clamp (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This latter ratio was similar to that observed in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects before the somatostatin infusion (1.5 +/- 0.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, after the clamp the PI/C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> ratio had decreased to 0.8 +/- 0.3% (P &lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, the postclamp PI/C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> ratio in the subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was elevated compared with that in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects (P &lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Based on these observations, while relief of secretory demand on beta-cells by somatostatin decreases the disproportionate elevation in PI levels in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the failure to normalize this measure suggests that an intrinsic abnormality of beta-cell function exists in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> that may be aggravated by increased secretory demand </plain></SENT>
