<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the inter-relationship between insulin sensitivity (S(I)) and S(G) in offspring of two parents with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and in individuals with no family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty non-diabetic individuals, including 26 offspring of two type 2 diabetic parents (family history, FH+) and 24 with no family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (FH-) similar in gender, age, ethnicity and body mass index (BMI) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each subject underwent a 100-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) and insulin modified frequently sampled intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, analysed using the Bergman's minimal model (MINMOD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirteen subjects of the FH+ group and nine of the FH- group had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>S(I) and S(G) were independent variables in the FH+ group, while they correlated highly with each other in the FH- group (r = 0.69, p = 0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relationship between S(I) and S(G) persisted when analysing the IGT and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance subgroups separately, demonstrating that these associations were not because of differences in glycaemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Consistently, S(G) strongly correlated with additional measures of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> only in the FH- group, including fasting insulin (r = 0.56, p = 0.004), homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (r = 0.57 p = 0.003) and BMI (r = 0.66, p = 0.0004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that familial factors impart important physiological differences in the inter-relationship between insulin-dependent and insulin-independent <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal, which may be important in modulating risk for development of disease </plain></SENT>
