<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of a high-protein (HP) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> diet compared with a lower-protein (LP) diet on fat and lean tissue and fasting and postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Replacing dietary protein for carbohydrate (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi>) during energy restriction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> has been effective in sparing lean mass and improving insulin sensitivity in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects but has not been tested in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared an HP diet (28% protein, 42% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi>, 28% fat [8% <z:chebi fb="4" ids="26607">saturated fatty acids</z:chebi>, 12% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25413">monounsaturated fatty acids</z:chebi>, 5% <z:chebi fb="7" ids="26208">polyunsaturated fatty acids</z:chebi>]) with an LP diet (16% protein, 55% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi>, 26% fat [8% <z:chebi fb="4" ids="26607">saturated fatty acids</z:chebi>, 11% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25413">monounsaturated fatty acids</z:chebi>, 5% <z:chebi fb="7" ids="26208">polyunsaturated fatty acids</z:chebi>]) in 54 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> men and women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during 8 weeks of energy restriction (1,600 kcal) and 4 weeks of energy balance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Body composition was determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at weeks 0 and 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> of 5.2 +/- 1.8 kg was achieved independently of diet composition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, women on the HP diet lost significantly more total (5.3 vs. 2.8 kg, P=0.009) and abdominal (1.3 vs. 0.7 kg, P=0.006) fat compared with the women on the LP diet, whereas, in men, there was no difference in fat loss between diets (3.9 vs. 5.1 kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Total lean mass decreased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects independently of diet composition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> reduction was significantly greater on the HP diet (5.7%) than on the LP diet (2.7%) (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Both dietary patterns resulted in improvements in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) risk profile as a consequence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the greater reductions in total and abdominal fat mass in women and greater <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> reduction observed in both sexes on the HP diet suggest that it is a valid diet choice for reducing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
