<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We also examined the risk of biliary disease (defined as occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001081'>cholelithiasis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001082'>cholecystitis</z:hpo>, or cholecystectomy), which is a major cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001733'>pancreatitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a large, geographically diverse U.S. health care claims database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eligible patients (&gt;or=18 years) were enrolled for at least 12 continuous months (1999-2005), with no incident events of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001733'>pancreatitis</z:hpo> or biliary disease during that 1 year baseline period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9 codes and prescription data were used to identify patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9 codes were also used to identify cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001733'>pancreatitis</z:hpo> and biliary disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, 337,067 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were matched on age and sex with 337,067 patients without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Incidence rates of disease and 95% CI were calculated per 100,000 person-years of exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The type 2 diabetic cohort had a 2.83-fold (95% CI 2.61-3.06) greater risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001733'>pancreatitis</z:hpo> and 1.91-fold (1.84-1.99) greater risk of biliary disease compared with the nondiabetic cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Relative to patients of corresponding age without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, younger type 2 diabetic patients had the highest risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001733'>pancreatitis</z:hpo> (&lt;45 years: incidence rate ratio [IRR] 5.26 [95% CI 4.31-6.42]; &gt;or=45 years: 2.44 [2.23-2.66]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may have an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001735'>acute pancreatitis</z:hpo> and biliary disease </plain></SENT>
