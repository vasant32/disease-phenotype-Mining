<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known about <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values of HbA(1c) in infants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to describe the distribution of HbA(1c) in 8- to 12-month-old nondiabetic infants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: HbA(1c) was measured in 86 infants participating in the Groningen Expert Center for Kids with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> (GECKO)-Drenthe birth cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anthropometric measurements were performed at Well Baby Clinics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data on parents and children were collected prospectively using questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HbA(1c) was normally distributed with a mean (SD) HbA(1c) level of 5.38% (0.24), range 4.8-6.0% or 35.29 mmol/mol (2.65), range 29.1-42.1 mmol/mol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Age, sex, birth weight, duration of breastfeeding, anthropometric measurements, and maternal BMI were not associated with HbA(1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> distribution of HbA(1c) with a relatively high mean HbA(1c) of 5.38% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant association between risk factors for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and HbA(1c) levels was found </plain></SENT>
