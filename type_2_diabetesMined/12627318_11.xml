<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is associated with impaired insulin action and secretion, including disturbed pulsatile release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Impaired pulsatility has been related to impaired insulin action, thus providing a possible link between release and action of insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, progressive loss of beta-cell mass has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate a possible link between loss of beta-cell mass and impaired pulsatile insulin secretion with special focus on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> responsiveness of insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The kinetic and dynamic profiles of insulin in GÃ¶ttingen minipigs are favourable for studies on pulsatility and a model of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with reduced beta-cell mass has recently been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pigs were studied before (n=14) and after (n=10) reduction of beta-cell mass by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17154">nicotinamide</z:chebi> (67 mg/kg) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> (125 mg/kg) from 17.7+/-4.7 (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> animals, n=5) to 6.1+/-2.0 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pulsatile insulin secretion was examined during basal (n=8 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, n=6 beta-cell reduced) and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> entrained (n=6 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, n=4 beta-cell reduced) conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Insulin concentration time series were analysed by autocorrelation and spectral analyses for periodicities and regularity, and by deconvolution for pulse frequency, mass and amplitude </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Reduction of beta-cell mass and secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> resulted in correspondingly (r=0.7421, p=0.0275) reduced pulse mass (42% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> during basal and 31% during entrained conditions) with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> periodicity (6.6+/-2.2 vs 5.8+/-2.4 min, p=0.50), regularity and entrainability of insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: Neither beta-cell loss, nor 2 weeks of slight <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e>, as seen in the beta-cell-reduced minipig, probably accounts for the disturbed insulin pulsatility observed in human Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
