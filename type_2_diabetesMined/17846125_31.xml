<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data come from 300 case subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> &lt;25 years and 334 nondiabetic control subjects aged &gt;or=45 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To provide for tests of within-family association, 121 nondiabetic siblings of case subjects were included along with 140 diabetic siblings of control subjects (172 sibships) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Individuals were genotyped on the Affymetrix 100K array, resulting in 80,044 usable single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SNPs were analyzed for within-family association and for general association in case and control subjects, and these tests were combined by Fisher's method, with priority given to the within-family test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were more SNPs with low P values than expected theoretically under the global null hypothesis of no association, and 128 SNPs had evidence for association at P &lt; 0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The association of these SNPs with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was further investigated in 1,207 diabetic and 1,627 nondiabetic individuals from the population study who were not included in the genome-wide study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SNPs from 10 genomic regions showed evidence for replication at P &lt; 0.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These included SNPs on chromosome 3 near ZNF659, chromosome 11 near FANCF, chromosome 11 near ZBTB15, and chromosome 12 near SENP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These studies suggest several regions where marker alleles are potentially in linkage disequilibrium with variants that confer susceptibility to young-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in American Indians </plain></SENT>
