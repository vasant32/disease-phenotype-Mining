<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study attempted to assess whether apo e4 allele is associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> in women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We selected 144 Chinese Han female type 2 diabetic patients without clinically detectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">angiopathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction/ASO probes were used to determine their mouthwash DNA apo E genotypes, and high-resolution ultrasound was used to measure brachial artery diameter at rest, after reactive hyperemia (with increased flow causing endothelium-dependent dilation) and after sublingual glyceryltrinitrate (GTN, an endothelium-independent dilator) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The flow-mediated arterial dilation among the subjects with e4/3 or e4/4 was 3.56+/-0.23%, which was significantly lower than that in subjects with e2/2 or e3/2 (3.97+/-0.36%) (p=0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The baseline vessel size, GTN-induced dilation and baseline blood flows were not significantly different among different apo E genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On univariate analysis, reduced flow-mediated arterial dilation was significantly related to total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>, Lp(a), <z:mp ids='MP_0002842'>high blood pressure</z:mp>, older age, family history of premature <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e>, larger vessel size, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and e4 allele (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By multiple stepwise regression analysis, reduced flow-mediated arterial dilation was associated with older age, large vessel size, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, positive family history, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>, Lp(a) and e4 allele (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The apo e4 allele is associated with impairment of endothelium-dependent arterial dilation in the relatively early stage of female type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
