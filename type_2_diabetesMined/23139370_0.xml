<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two important determinants of intracellular cholesterol content are the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters A1 (ABCA1) and -G1 (ABCG1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whether genetic variation in ABCA1 and ABCG1 predicts risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the general population is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We tested whether genetic variation in the promoter and coding regions of ABCA1 and ABCG1 predicted risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven variants, identified by previous resequencing of both genes, were genotyped in the Copenhagen City Heart Study (CCHS) (n = 10,185) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two loss-of-function mutations (ABCA1 N1800H and ABCG1 g.-376C&gt;T) (n = 322) and a common variant (ABCG1 g.-530A&gt;G) were further genotyped in the Copenhagen General Population Study (CGPS) (n = 30,415) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Only one of the variants examined, ABCG1 g.-530A&gt;G, predicted a decreased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the CCHS (P for trend = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, when validated in the CGPS or in the CCHS and CGPS combined (n = 40,600), neither the two loss-of-function mutations (ABCA1 N1800H, ABCG1 g.-376C&gt;T) nor ABCG1 g.-530A&gt;G were associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P values &gt;0.57 and &gt;0.30, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Genetic variations in ABCA1 and ABCG1 were not associated with increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data were obtained in general population samples harboring the largest number of heterozygotes for loss-of-function mutations in ABCA1 and ABCG1 </plain></SENT>
