<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This cross-sectional analysis was a substudy in 711 patients (159 with and 552 without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) of the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT) based on digital 30-degree images of superior and inferior temporal <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> fields </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SAA was associated with arteriolar length-to-diameter ratio positively in nondiabetic patients (P(trend)= 0.028) but negatively in diabetic patients (P(trend)= 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The difference was unlikely to be a chance finding (P = 0.007 for interaction) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similar results were found for the association of SAA with arteriolar tortuosity (P = 0.05 for interaction) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Associations were less pronounced for CRP and <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Inflammatory processes are differentially involved in <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> microvascular disease in diabetic compared with nondiabetic hypertensive individuals </plain></SENT>
