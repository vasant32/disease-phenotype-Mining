<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The Veterans Affairs <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Trial (VADT) was a randomized, prospective, controlled trial of 1,791 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> to determine whether intensive glycemic control would reduce cardiovascular events compared with standard control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effect of intensive glycemic control and selected baseline variables on renal outcomes is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Baseline mean age was 60.4 years, mean duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 11.5 years, HbA(1c) was 9.4%, and blood pressure was 132/76 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The renal exclusion was serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> &gt;1.6 mg/dL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Renal outcomes were sustained worsening of the urine albumin-to-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio (ACR) and sustained worsening by one or more stages in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Intensive glycemic control did not independently reduce ACR progression but was associated with a significant attenuation in the progression of ACR in those who had baseline photocoagulation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo> surgery, or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The beneficial effect of intensive glycemic control increased with increasing BMI and with decreasing diastolic blood pressure (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intensive glycemic control was associated with less worsening of eGFR with increasing baseline ACR and insulin use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Baseline systolic blood pressure, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, and photocoagulation were associated with worsening of eGFR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intensive glycemic control had no significant effect on the progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal disease</z:e> in the whole cohort but was associated with some protection against increasing ACR in those with more advanced microvascular disease, lower baseline <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi>, or higher baseline BMI and on worsening of eGFR in those with high baseline ACR </plain></SENT>
