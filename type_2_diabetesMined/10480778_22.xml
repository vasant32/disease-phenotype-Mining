<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously demonstrated that African-American children are hyperinsulinemic and insulin resistant compared with their white American peers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present investigation was to assess the impact of family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on insulin sensitivity in African-American children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 13 prepubertal healthy children with negative family history (FH-) and 9 with positive family history (FH+) of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> underwent a 3-h hyperinsulinemic (40 mU x m(-2) x min(-1))-euglycemic clamp study to assess insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The groups were comparable for age, pubertal status, total body <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, abdominal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> assessed by computed tomography scan at the level of L4-5 lumbar vertebra, and physical fitness measured by maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The FH+, compared with the FH-, group had lower insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal (10.9+/-1.2 vs. 14.2+/-0.9 mg x kg(-1) x min(-1), P = 0.035) and lower nonoxidative <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal (5.7+/-0.8 vs. 8.3+/-0.6 mg x kg(-1) x min(-1), P = 0.015), with no differences in rates of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> oxidation, fat oxidation, or insulin-mediated free fatty acid suppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fasting hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production assessed with [6,6-2H2]<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and basal rates of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and fat oxidation were not different between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that in African-American children, family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These children manifest important metabolic alterations, including impaired insulin-stimulated total and nonoxidative <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal early in the first decade of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We propose that this familial tendency, combined with environmental influences, could lead to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> decades later </plain></SENT>
