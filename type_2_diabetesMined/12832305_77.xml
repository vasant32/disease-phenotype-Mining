<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The serum levels of adiponectin and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) at baseline (from 1995 to 1997) were evaluated in 1,792 individuals (1,023 women and 769 men, aged 58.5 +/- 12.5 years) from a cohort population (n = 3,706) of the Funagata study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> tolerance was evaluated at baseline and also at 5-year follow-up examinations (n = 978, follow-up rate, 54.6%) according to the 1985 World Health Organization criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The correlation of clinical traits with serum levels of adiponectin was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The association of the traits with the progression to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at the 5-year follow-up was also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the traits examined, the correlation with aging was highest (r = 0.312, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eighteen subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (NGT) developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and 709 remained NGT at the 5-year follow-up examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The subjects who became diabetic had decreased serum levels of adiponectin (7.29 +/- 2.35 vs. 9.13 +/- 2.35 10 x log microg/ml, P = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analysis with age, sex, waist-to-hip ratio, and 2-h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> as the variables revealed that serum adiponectin level (odds ratio [per 0.1 log microg/ml] 0.766, P = 0.029) was an independent risk factor for the progression to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The subjects whose serum levels of adiponectin were in the lowest tertile were 9.320 times (95% CI 1.046-83.1) more likely to develop <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than those in the highest tertile (P = 0.046) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Decreased serum adiponectin level is an independent risk factor for progression to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
