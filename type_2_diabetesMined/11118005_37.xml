<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Hedgehogs (Hhs) are intercellular signaling molecules that regulate tissue patterning in mammalian development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mammalian Hhs include Sonic hedgehog (Shh), Indian hedgehog (Ihh), and Desert hedgehog (Dhh) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The absence of Shh expression is required for the early development of the <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> and exocrine pancreas, but whether Hh signaling functions in the fully developed adult <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> pancreas is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we report that Hhs Ihh and Dhh and their receptors patched (Ptc) and smoothened are expressed in the <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> islets of Langerhans of the fully developed rat pancreas and in the clonal gamma-cell line INS-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate the coexpression of Ptc with insulin in beta-cells of mouse pancreatic islets, indicating that beta-cells are targets of active Hh signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The administration of cyclopamine, a Hh signaling inhibitor, decreases both insulin secretion from and insulin content of INS-1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effects of Hh signaling on insulin production occur at the transcriptional level because activation of Hh signal transduction by ectopic expression of Shh increases rat insulin I promoter activation in a dose-dependent manner in transient transfections of INS-1 and MIN6 beta-cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, inhibition of Hh signaling with increasing concentrations of cyclopamine progressively reduces insulin promoter activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the treatment of INS-1 cells with cyclopamine diminishes endogenous insulin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We propose that Hh signaling is not restricted to patterning in early pancreas development but also continues to signal in differentiated beta-cells of the <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> pancreas in regulating insulin production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, defective Hh signaling in the pancreas should be considered as a potential factor in the pathogenesis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
