<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To study associations of the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi>-1alpha gene locus with carbohydrate metabolism and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in humans, we identified several polymorphisms in the promoter region that were located in a haplotype block distinct from a second haplotype block containing part of intron 2 and extending beyond exon 13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each block contained five common haplotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance testing revealed associations of promoter haplotype combinations with 30- and 60-min postload plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, whereas haplotypes in both blocks were associated with indexes of beta-cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The associations of promoter haplotypes are supported by functional studies showing that some polymorphisms are located in transcription factor binding sites and affect transactivation in an allele-specific manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By comparing patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and control subjects, we observed borderline significant differences of four-loci haplotype distributions in the downstream haplotype block </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the haplotype that was associated with the strongest insulin response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> conferred the lowest risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi>-1alpha gene locus influences carbohydrate metabolism and contributes to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the population studied </plain></SENT>
