<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is characterized by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948379" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">impaired insulin secretion</z:e> in response to increased metabolic demand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This defect in beta-cell compensation seems to result from the interplay between environmental factors and genetic predisposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genome-wide association studies reveal that common variants in transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) are associated with increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to establish whether TCF7L2 plays a role in beta-cell function and/or survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: To investigate the effects of TCFL7L2 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath>, isolated islets were exposed to TCF7L2 small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (siRNA) versus scrambled siRNA, and beta-cell survival and function were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For TCF7L2 overexpression, islets were cultured in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations of 5.5-33.3 mmol/l and the cytokine mix interleukin-1 beta/gamma-interferon with or without overexpression of TCF7L2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), beta-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> [by transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick-end labeling assay and Western blotting for poly(<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi>) polymerase and Caspase-3 cleavage], and beta-cell proliferation (by Ki67 immunostaining) were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Depleting TCF7L2 by siRNA resulted in a 5.1-fold increase in beta-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, 2.2-fold decrease in beta-cell proliferation (P &lt; 0.001), and 2.6-fold decrease in GSIS (P &lt; 0.01) in human islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similarly, loss of TCF7L2 resulted in impaired beta-cell function in mouse islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, overexpression of TCF7L2 protected islets from <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and cytokine-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and impaired function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TCF7L2 is required for maintaining GSIS and beta-cell survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Changes in the level of active TCF7L2 in beta-cells from carriers of at-risk allele may be the reason for defective insulin secretion and progression of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
