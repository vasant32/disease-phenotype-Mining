<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The increasing proportions of older persons accounting for global populations, and the implications for increasing rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> diseases such as type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, continue to be a cause of concern for clinicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Considering that older persons are a very <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> group of individuals, the management of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is particularly challenging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Once type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is diagnosed, the principles of its management are similar to those in younger patients, but with special considerations linked to the increased prevalence of comorbidities and relative inability to tolerate adverse effects of medication and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, there are clinical aspects complicating <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care in the elderly including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009241" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive disorders</z:e>, physical disability and geriatric syndromes, such as frailty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Available anti-diabetic oral drugs include insulin secretagogues (meglitinides and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3095">biguanides</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>) alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> (TZDs) and newly introduced glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) analogues and inhibitors of GLP-1 degrading enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, as type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> progresses in older persons, polypharmacy intensification is required to reach adequate metabolic control with the risk of adverse effects due to age-related changes in drug metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The present review discusses the European <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Working Party guidelines for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in older persons with and without frailty and their importance on preventing or at least slowing down diverse aspects of disability </plain></SENT>
