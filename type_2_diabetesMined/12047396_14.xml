<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This multicentre, double-blind, parallel group trial included 467 metformin-treated patients with glycosylated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA1c) between 6.8% and 11% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomized to add nateglinide 60 mg, 120 mg or placebo before three meals to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> 1000 mg b.i.d. for 24 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HbA1c was significantly reduced with nateglinide 60 mg and 120 mg plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> control (-0.36%, p = 0.003; -0.59%, p &lt; 0.001 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Greater benefits occurred if patients had elevated HbA1c at baseline (-1.38% with nateglinide 120 mg in patients with HbA1c &gt; 9.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A modest fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> reduction was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most symptoms suggestive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> occurred in patients with low HbA1c levels (&lt;or= 8%) at baseline, although no confirmed cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> occurred with nateglinide 60 mg in this patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Events suggestive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> were confirmed in 1.1% of cases (plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &lt;or= 3.3 mmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>Weight gain</z:mp> over 24 weeks was 0.9 kg with nateglinide 120 mg vs. <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> alone, and plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In patients stabilized on high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, the addition of nateglinide improved glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The combination of these agents was well tolerated and both doses of nateglinide proved effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of nateglinide 60 mg and the low rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> observed at this dose make it suitable for patients close to their therapeutic target on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy </plain></SENT>
