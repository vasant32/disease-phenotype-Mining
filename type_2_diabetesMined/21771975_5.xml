<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether other novel genes influence the variation in adiponectin level and the roles of these genetic variants on subsequent clinical outcomes has not been thoroughly investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we aimed not only to identify genetic variants modulating plasma adiponectin levels but also to investigate whether these variants are associated with adiponectin-related metabolic traits and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with high molecular weight forms of adiponectin levels by genotyping 382 young-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> hypertensive (YOH) subjects with Illumina HumanHap550 SNP chips </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The culpable single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variants responsible for lowered adiponectin were then confirmed in another 559 YOH subjects, and the association of these SNP variants with the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> (MS), type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> was examined in an independent community-based prospective cohort, the CardioVascular Disease risk FACtors Two-township Study (CVDFACTS, n = 3,350) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The SNP (rs4783244) most significantly associated with adiponectin levels was located in intron 1 of the T-cadherin (CDH13) gene in the first stage (P = 7.57 × 10(-9)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We replicated and confirmed the association between rs4783244 and plasma adiponectin levels in an additional 559 YOH subjects (P = 5.70 × 10(-17)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This SNP was further associated with the risk of MS (odds ratio [OR] = 1.42, P = 0.027), T2DM in men (OR = 3.25, P = 0.026), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (OR = 2.13, P = 0.002) in the CVDFACTS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicated the role of T-cadherin in modulating adiponectin levels and the involvement of CDH13 or adiponectin in the development of cardiometabolic diseases </plain></SENT>
