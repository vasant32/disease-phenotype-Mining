<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Overload of the beta cell, mediated by a variety of mechanisms, may sensitise it to immune damage and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and thus accelerate ongoing autoimmune processes leading to its destruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Environmental risk determinants that may exert such overload effects include <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> due to excess fat cell accumulation, and increased insulin requirement due to a high growth rate, physical stress (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038443" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychological stress</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The increasing incidence of childhood <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and the shift to younger age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, is unlikely to be driven by environmental risk factors that have been associated with initiation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo>, e.g. <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042769" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">virus infections</z:e> or early infant feeding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Risk factors that may accelerate beta cell destruction have shown a steady increase in the population, and are more plausible causes of such a pattern of change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Child growth, weight and birthweight are well-established estimates of community wealth and increase in most countries of Europe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overfeeding of children early in life leads to both accelerated growth and weight, and even a moderate excess of child growth, not necessarily associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, is associated with risk of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>New, safe and effective immune-modulating drugs for possible arrest of the autoimmune process may become available in time, but in the interim these accelerating factors may be targeted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Public health programmes for pregnant mothers and young families, aiming at changing overfeeding and the sedentary lifestyle of the children would be preferable to other alternatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interventions such as these would be safe and could potentially influence future risks of type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and other major threats to adult health </plain></SENT>
