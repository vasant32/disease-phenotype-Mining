<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fibrinogen fractional (FSR) and absolute (ASR) synthesis rates were measured using a leucine isotopic model in type 2 diabetic men (n = 7; age = 51 +/- 3 years; BMI = 26.7 +/- 1 kg/m(2)) compared with matched nondiabetic subjects under basal conditions and following a 4-h euglycemic-, euaminoacidemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Basal fibrinogen concentration (+35%, P &lt; 0.05) and ASR (+35%, P &lt; 0.05) were greater in the diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Following clamp, fibrinogen FSR and ASR were unchanged in the control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, fibrinogen FSR and ASR increased by 41 and 43%, respectively (P &lt; 0.05), in the diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, fibrinogen production is acutely increased by insulin when euglycemia and euaminoacidemia are maintained in type 2 diabetic individuals but not in nondiabetic individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Enhanced fibrinogen production by insulin is likely to be a key alteration contributing to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011899'>hyperfibrinogenemia</z:hpo> and therefore cardiovascular risk in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Unchanged fibrinogen production in nondiabetic individuals suggests a role of plasma amino acids in regulating fibrinogen production in humans </plain></SENT>
