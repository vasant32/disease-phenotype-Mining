<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This review describes possible reasons for the discrepancies which include species variation of GIP, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of molecules with different immunoreactivity and bioactivity, deterioration of immunoreactivity of standard and sample on prolonged storage and the effect of the preceding intake of type and quantity of food </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The problems can be resolved by raising antibodies to synthetic human GIP and its fragments, the chemical characterization of and the raising of antibodies to immunoreactive GIP 8000, the correct storage of samples and the standard preparation of subjects prior to experimental procedures </plain></SENT>
