<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Six healthy men underwent 9,11,12,12-[(2)H](4)-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> infusions with simultaneous sampling of arterialized and superficial epigastric vein blood sampling </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, visceral adipose 11beta-HSD1 activity is insufficient to increase portal vein <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> concentrations and hence to influence intrahepatic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> signaling </plain></SENT>
