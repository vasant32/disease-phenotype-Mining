<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The postprandial blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level in voglibose-treated GK rats was significantly lower than in untreated GK rats (190+/-19 vs. 250+/-25 mg/dl, P&lt;0.01; 1 h, 212+/-23 vs. 256+/-20, P&lt;0.05; 2 h), and the activities of maltase, sucrase, and isomaltase remained significantly lower throughout the 6 months of voglibose treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The expressions of protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> of sucrase-isomaltase (SI) complex were significantly higher in voglibose-treated GK rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Voglibose administration then was stopped after 6 months of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level and protein level of the SI complex became normalized during the interruption of drug administration, and disaccharidase activities increased almost to the level of the untreated group 1 month after treatment was stopped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 1 day of re-administration of the drug, however, disaccharidase activities again became significantly inhibited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that voglibose may improve <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance since it inhibits activities of disaccharidases in spite of increasing the expression of them on intestine, furthermore voglibose may be reversible and reproducible through interruption and re-administration </plain></SENT>
