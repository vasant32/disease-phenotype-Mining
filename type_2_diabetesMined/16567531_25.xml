<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests (OGTTs) and intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests (IVGTTs) were performed at 15-month intervals for up to 5 years or until fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> exceeded 140 mg/dl in Hispanic women with recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data were analyzed 1) to compare changes in insulin sensitivity, beta-cell function, and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels between women who had <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at one or more visits and women who remained <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> free and 2) to determine longitudinal patterns of change in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> beta-cell compensation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seventy-one women provided data from a total of 280 paired OGTTs and IVGTTs during a median follow-up of 46 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with the 47 women who remained free of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the 24 who either had <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 9) or developed it during follow-up (n = 15) had higher baseline <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels and lower <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> beta-cell compensation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Baseline insulin sensitivity was low in both groups and did not change significantly during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fasting and 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels increased more rapidly in the diabetic group despite a decline in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> beta-cell compensation that was significantly slower than the decline in women who did not develop <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This paradox was explained by an accelerated rise in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels for any decline in beta-cell compensation when beta-cell compensation reached approximately 10% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, a level that was reached in the women who had or developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> but not in the women who remained <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> free </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings define a pathogenesis for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in one high-risk group that is characterized by a relatively long-term decline in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> beta-cell compensation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> that is attended by slowly rising <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only relatively late in this process do <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels rise rapidly and into the diabetic range </plain></SENT>
