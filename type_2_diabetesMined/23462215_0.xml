<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The worldwide growing epidemic of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is driven by the increase in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The very insidious natural history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the availability of simple means to detect it as well as its preceding silent stages make type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and ideal disease for screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although public policies for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> screening do exist in many developed countries, issues related to its benefits on disease outcomes and its cost-effectiveness have been a concern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recent results from the Anglo-Danish-Dutch Study of Intensive Treatment in People with Screen-Detected <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> in Primary Care (ADDITION)-Cambridge show that screening for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is not associated with a reduction in mortality, either <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause, cardiovascular or <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related, after 10 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It seems crucial to raise the awareness of the medical community on the high risk of misinterpretation of these results as the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> knell of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To that end, we discuss here some potential explanations of the lack of benefit, and we suggest a cautious uptake of the results, especially in low-income countries where type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> screening is by far more likely to yield substantial health benefits </plain></SENT>
