<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we focused on a family of serine-threonine kinases known as homeodomain-interacting protein kinases (HIPKs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HIPKs are implicated in the modulation of Wnt signalling, which plays a crucial role in transcriptional activity, and in pancreas development and maintenance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to characterise the role of HIPKs in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> interference to characterise the role of HIPKs in regulating insulin secretion and transcription activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conducted RT-PCR and western blot analyses to analyse the expression and abundance of HIPK genes and proteins in the islets of high-fat diet-fed mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi>-induced insulin secretion and beta cell proliferation were measured in islets from Hipk3 ( -/- ) mice, which have <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> owing to an insulin secretion deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The abundance of pancreatic duodenal homeobox (PDX)-1 and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase kinase (GSK)-3β phosphorylation in Hipk3 ( -/- ) islets was determined by immunohistology and western blot analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that HIPKs regulate insulin secretion and transcription activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hipk3 expression was most significantly increased in the islets of high-fat diet-fed mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced insulin secretion and beta cell proliferation were decreased in the islets of Hipk3 ( -/- ) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Levels of PDX1 and GSK-3β phosphorylation were significantly decreased in Hipk3 ( -/- ) islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>Depletion</z:mpath> of HIPK3 impairs insulin secretion and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Decreased levels of HIPK3 may play a substantial role in the pathogenesis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
