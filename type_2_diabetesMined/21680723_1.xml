<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We recruited people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> aged ≥ 40 years with a glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (A1C) ≥ 7%, living in Hamilton, Canada, who were enrolled in a community-based program (<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Hamilton) that provided regular evidence-based information and <z:mp ids='MP_0008913'>listings</z:mp> of community resources designed to facilitate <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After completing a questionnaire, participants were randomly allocated to either receive or not receive periodic computer-generated, evidence-based feedback on the basis of their questionnaire responses and designed to facilitate improved glycemic control and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was a change in A1C after 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 465 participants (50% women, mean age 62 years, and mean A1C 7.83%) were randomly assigned, and 12-month A1C values were available in 96% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants, at which time the A1C level had decreased by an absolute amount of 0.24 and 0.15% in the intervention and control groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The difference in A1C reduction for the intervention versus control group was 0.09% (95% CI -0.08 to 0.26; P = 0.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No between-group differences in measures of quality of life, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-management behaviors, or clinical outcomes were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Providing computer-generated tailored feedback to registrants of a generic, community-based program that supports <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-management does not lead to lower A1C levels or a better quality of life than participation in the community-based program (augmented by periodic A1C testing) alone </plain></SENT>
