<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) -634G&gt;C at the 5' regulatory region of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the risk of proliferative diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDR</z:e>) in the Brazilian population of European ancestry with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A case-control study was conducted in 501 type 2 diabetic patients of European ancestry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent a standardized clinical, ophthalmological, and laboratory evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these, 167 patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDR</z:e> (case patients), and 334 were considered as control subjects (patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDR</z:e>) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDR</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A reference population (110 individuals of European ancestry) was also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No evidence of association between -634G&gt;C/VEGF and the presence of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was observed (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, CC homozygous for the SNP -634G&gt;C was significantly more frequent in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDR</z:e> (37 of 167; 22.2%) than in the corresponding control group (40 of 334; 12%) in accordance with a recessive model (P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This effect was further observed when <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, BMI, sex, duration of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, and systolic blood pressure were taken into account (odds ratio 1.9 [95% CI 1.01-3.79], P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The presence of the allele -634C/VEGF in homozygosity is an independent risk factor for the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDR</z:e> in type 2 diabetic patients of European ancestry </plain></SENT>
