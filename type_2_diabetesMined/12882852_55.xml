<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied a random sample of 1,364 subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were members of a Michigan health maintenance organization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Demographic characteristics, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treatments, glycemic control, complications, and comorbidities were assessed by surveys and medical chart reviews </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Annual resource utilization and costs were assessed using health insurance claims </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The log-transformed annual direct medical costs were fitted by multiple linear regression to indicator variables for demographics, treatments, glycemic control, complications, and comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median annual direct medical costs for subjects with diet-controlled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, BMI 30 kg/m(2), and no microvascular, neuropathic, or cardiovascular complications were 1,700 dollars for white men and 2,100 dollars for white women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A 10-kg/m(2) increase in BMI, treatment with oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive agents</z:chebi>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011881" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic kidney disease</z:e>, cerebrovascular disease, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo> were each associated with 10-30% increases in cost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Insulin treatment, <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp>, and MI were each associated with 60-90% increases in cost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Dialysis was associated with an 11-fold increase in cost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Insulin treatment and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> complications have a substantial impact on the direct medical costs of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The estimates presented in this model may be used to analyze the cost-effectiveness of interventions for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
