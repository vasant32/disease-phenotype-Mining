<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study describes the mechanisms of this effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In proportional hazards regression models with 2,155 subjects, changes in weight, the insulinogenic index (IGR), fasting insulin, and proinsulin were predictive of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, though to different degrees within each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean change in weight, fasting insulin, and proinsulin, but not IGR, differed between groups during the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 1.7-kg <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> versus a 0.3-kg gain with placebo alone explained 64% of the beneficial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> effect on <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adjustment for weight, fasting insulin, proinsulin, and other metabolic factors combined explained 81% of the beneficial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> effect, but it remained nominally significant (P = 0.034) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After the addition of changes in fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, 99% of the group effect was explained and is no longer significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment of high-risk subjects with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> results in modest <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and favorable changes in insulin sensitivity and proinsulin, which contribute to a reduction in the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> apart from the associated reductions in fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
