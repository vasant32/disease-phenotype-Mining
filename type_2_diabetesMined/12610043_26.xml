<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that increased <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, measured early in pregnancy, is associated with the subsequent development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> mellitus (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e>), a precursor of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective nested case-control study in a pregnancy cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>First-trimester C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were measured using a high-resolution assay in 43 women who subsequently developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> and in a random sample of 94 women who remained euglycemic throughout pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median CRP levels were compared using Wilcoxon's rank-sum test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression was used to compute unadjusted and multivariable-adjusted odds ratios for developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> among CRP tertiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: First-trimester CRP levels were significantly increased among women who subsequently developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> compared with control subjects (3.1 vs. 2.1 mg/l, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> among women in the highest CRP tertile compared with the lowest tertile was 3.2 (95% CI 1.2-8.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, smoking, parity, blood pressure, and gestational age at CRP sampling, the risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> among women in the highest compared with the lowest tertile was 3.6 (95% CI 1.2-11.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When BMI was included in the model, however, the association between increased CRP and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> was attenuated (odds ratio for the highest compared with lowest tertile 1.5 [95% CI 0.4-5.5]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In women who develop <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e>, there is evidence of increased <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> during the first trimester </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This association is mediated in part by <z:mp ids='MP_0006087'>increased BMI</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Larger studies are needed to verify these results </plain></SENT>
