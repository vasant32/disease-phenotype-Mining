<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A number of risk factors are associated with prevalent undiagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The use of routinely available information on these factors has been proposed as a simple and effective way of identifying individuals at high risk for having the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of the Cambridge risk score in a large and representative population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A risk score derived from data in a previous study was tested for its ability to detect prevalent undiagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> as measured by a GHb &gt; or = 6.0, 6.5, or 7% in 6,567 subjects aged 39-78 years in the European Prospective Investigation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e>-Norfolk cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For a specificity of 78%, the risk score predicted a GHb of &gt; or = 7.0% in subjects aged 39-78 years, with a sensitivity of 51% (95% CI 40-62) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The areas under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve for GHb &gt; or = 6.0, 6.5, and 7% were 65.7% (63.8-67.6), 71.2% (68.4-75.2), and 74.2% (69.5-79.0), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The area under the ROC curve was not significantly reduced if data on family and smoking history were unavailable for any of the cut-offs for GHb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The risk score performed as well as other previously reported models in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We concluded that a simple risk score using data routinely available in primary care can identify people with an elevated GHb with reasonable sensitivity and specificity, and it could therefore form part of a strategy for early detection of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
