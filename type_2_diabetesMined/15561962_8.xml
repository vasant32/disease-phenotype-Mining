<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its gene, CASQ1, is encoded on chromosome 1q21, a region that has been linked to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the Amish and several other populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We screened <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 11 exons, exon-intron junctions, and the proximal regulatory region of CASQ1 for mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We detected four novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (-1470C--&gt;T, -1456delG, -1366insG, and 593C--&gt;T) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ten informative SNPs within CASQ1 were genotyped in Amish subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 145), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (n = 148), and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (n = 358) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rs2275703 and rs617698 in introns 4 and 2 were significantly associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P = 0.008 and 0.04, respectively); three other SNPs showed borderline evidence for association to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P = 0.076-0.093) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in nondiabetic subjects (n = 754), both rs2275703 and rs617698 were significantly associated with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> area under the curve during an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (P = 0.035 and 0.013, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Haplotype analysis suggested that no haplotype could explain these associations better than rs2275703 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings, coupled with similar findings in Utah Caucasians, suggest that sequence variation in CASQ1 may influence risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
