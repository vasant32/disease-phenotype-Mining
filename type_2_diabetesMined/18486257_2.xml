<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the effects of changes in basal/total daily insulin ratio (B/TD ratio) in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients on intensive insulin therapy including insulin glargine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The B/TD ratio used in our Japanese patients was about 0.35, and the ratio was increased up to about 0.46+/-0.12 without change of total insulin daily dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 24-week-treatment, mean glycated albumin of the patients whose B/TD ratio was increased was significantly lower than those of the patients whose B/TD ratio was not changed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that adequate supplementation of basal insulin may be important for maximum effect of bolus insulin even in Japanese who have serious defect in postprandial rapid insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
