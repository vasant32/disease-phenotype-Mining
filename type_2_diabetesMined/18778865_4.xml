<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the effects of two insulin-sensitizing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi> on plasma visfatin and adiponectin levels in patients with newly diagnosed and untreated type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-four patients with T2DM were randomized to treatment either with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (15-45mg/day) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (1000-2000mg/day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma visfatin and adiponectin levels and homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-IR) scores were determined at baseline and at 12th week of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: By the end of the 12th week, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, HbA1c, HOMA-IR scores and waist circumferences improved equally in both treatment arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> and adiponectin levels increased only in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> group (p=0.01 and p=0.003, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> treatment had additional regulatory effects on BMI, blood pressure and total and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> levels (p=0.002, p=0.01, p=0.004, p=0.001 and p&lt;0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neither <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> nor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> displayed a significant effect on circulating visfatin concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite improvements in insulin sensitivity and glycemic regulation, either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> treatment did not result in any effect on blood visfatin levels in patients with treatment na√Øve T2DM </plain></SENT>
