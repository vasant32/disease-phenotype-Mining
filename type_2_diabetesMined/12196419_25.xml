<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed cross-sectional metabolic studies in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals with and without type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study population consisted of 16 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (BMI &gt;30 kg/m(2)) diabetic subjects with a mean age of 52 +/- 2 years (SE) and 16 nondiabetic control subjects of similar age and weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cholesterol absorption efficiency was measured with peroral dual isotopes and cholesterol synthesis with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15889">sterol</z:chebi> balance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum total cholesterol did not differ between the groups, but <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> were significantly lower and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47773">VLDL cholesterol</z:chebi> and serum total and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47776">VLDL triglycerides</z:chebi> were higher in the diabetic group than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cholesterol absorption efficiency was 29 +/- 1% in diabetic subjects vs. 42 +/- 2% in the control subjects (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cholesterol synthesis was higher (17 +/- 1 vs. 14 +/- 1 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>kg(-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>day(-1); P &lt; 0.05) and neutral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15889">sterol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> excretion and cholesterol turnover tended to be higher in the diabetic group than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was positively related to cholesterol synthesis in the diabetic group (r = +0.663, P &lt; 0.01) and in the control group (r = +0.590, P &lt; 0.05), suggesting that the higher blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level, the higher the cholesterol synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was significantly positively related to fecal neutral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15889">sterol</z:chebi> excretion in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cholesterol absorption efficiency was lower and cholesterol synthesis was higher in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than in those without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, suggesting that <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> modulates cholesterol metabolism more than <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> alone </plain></SENT>
