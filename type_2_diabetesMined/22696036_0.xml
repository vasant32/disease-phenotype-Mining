<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The c-Kit-dependent effects are due to enhanced Akt activity that phosphorylates and inhibits <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), thereby increasing the expression of numerous genes that promote insulin production and cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Regulating the c-Kit/Akt/GSK3β pathway may provide novel means for improving beta cell function in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
