<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two 2-year, randomised, multicentre trials were performed in patients with inadequately controlled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (HbA1c 7.5-11% inclusive), who were receiving either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> or a sulphonylurea at &gt; or = 50% of the maximum recommended dose or at the maximum tolerated dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the first study, patients on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> received add-on therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (15-45 mg/day, n = 317) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi> (80-320 mg/day, n = 313) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the second study, patients on sulphonylurea therapy were randomised to receive add-on therapy with either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (15-45 mg/day, n = 319) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (850-2,550 mg/day, n = 320) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HbA(1)c, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At week 104, the mean reduction from baseline in HbA(1)c was 0.89% for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> and 0.77% for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi> addition to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (p = 0.200) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a statistically significant between-group difference for the change in mean fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> at week 104 (-1.8 mmol/l for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> vs -1.1 mmol/l for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi>, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in changes from baseline in glycaemic parameters for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> addition to sulphonylurea therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Whether added to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> or sulphonylurea, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> caused significantly greater decreases in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> and significantly greater increases in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> than the comparator regimens (p &lt; or = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were decreases in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> in the comparator groups and these were significantly different from the small changes observed with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> treatment regimens were well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were weight increases of 2.5 kg and 3.7 kg in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> and 1.2 kg in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi> add-on groups, and there was a mean decrease of 1.7 kg in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> add-on group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: As add-on therapy to existing sulphonylurea or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> therapy, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> improved glycaemic control and this improvement was sustained over 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there were potential benefits in terms of improvements in specific <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This could offer an advantage over the addition of other oral agents in the long-term treatment of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
