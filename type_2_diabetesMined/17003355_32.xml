<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that visfatin is associated with insulin secretion in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To this aim, a cross-sectional study was conducted in 118 nondiabetic men and 64 (35 men and 29 women) type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Type 1 diabetic patients with long-standing disease (n = 58; 31 men and 27 women) were also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In nondiabetic subjects, circulating visfatin (enzyme immunoassay) was independently associated with insulin secretion (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> [AIRg] from intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests) but not with insulin sensitivity (Si) or other metabolic or anthropometric parameters, and AIRg alone explained 8% of visfatin variance (beta = -0.29, P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Circulating visfatin was increased in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (mean 18 [95% CI 16-21] vs. 15 ng/ml [13-17] for type 2 diabetic and nondiabetic subjects, respectively; P = 0.017, adjusted for sex, age, and BMI), although this association was largely attenuated after accounting for HbA1c (A1C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, circulating visfatin was found to be increased in patients with long-standing type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, even after adjusting for A1C values (37 ng/ml [34-40]; P &lt; 0.0001, adjusted for sex, age, BMI, and A1C compared with either type 2 diabetic or nondiabetic subjects) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In summary, circulating visfatin is increased with progressive beta-cell deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The study of the regulation and role of visfatin in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> merits further consideration </plain></SENT>
