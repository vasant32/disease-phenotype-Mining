<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to identify factors that influence basal insulin requirement in insulin-naïve patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 50 insulin-naïve patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their basal insulin requirement was calculated by 8h overnight intravenous insulin infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent abdominal computed tomography; subcutaneous and visceral fat areas were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The basal insulin requirement was 31.3 ± 16.9 units/day, and it varied widely from 0.2 to 1.4 units/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was positively correlated with visceral fat area (γ=0.485, P&lt;0.001), body mass index (BMI, γ=0.339, P=0.008), glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA1C, γ=0.327, P=0.019), alanine aminotransferase (ALT, γ=0.310, P=0.027), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> (γ=0.305, P=0.032) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, body weight, waist circumference and total fat mass were not related to basal insulin requirement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multiple linear regression analysis showed that visceral fat area, HbA1C, and ALT are independent predictors of basal insulin requirement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Visceral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> was a better predictor than generalized <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> for basal insulin requirement at the initiation of insulin therapy in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
