<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Individuals with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism (NGM, n=161), impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism (IGM, n=19) and type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM, n=20) underwent a 75 g-OGTT and an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> (75 g carbohydrates, 50 g fat, 24 g proteins) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Classical estimates of beta-cell function (insulinogenic index and the ratio of areas under insulin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> curves) were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mathematical modelling was used to determine beta-cell <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> sensitivity, rate sensitivity and potentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity was characterized by three surrogate estimates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both classical and model-based estimates of beta-cell function were higher during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> than during OGTT (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Regarding the model-based parameters, especially beta-cell sensitivity was increased following <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> as compared with OGTT (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both during OGTT and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>, across most parameters describing beta-cell function, the largest reduction in beta-cell response occurred between IGM and DM, while the largest reduction in insulin sensitivity occurred between NGM and IGM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that beta-cell response is stronger after a mixed meal than after an OGTT with equal carbohydrate quantity, both for classical and model-based parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The higher response was mostly explained by higher beta-cell sensitivity during the meal </plain></SENT>
