<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male C57BL/6 mice (n = 12/group) aged 4 to 6 weeks and weighing &gt;15 g received a high-fat diet throughout this 45-day study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After a 7-day handling period, baseline levels of plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, plasma insulin and glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA1c) were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Animals were allocated to one of six groups: compound vehicle control, intraperitoneal <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> (STZ, 50 mg/kg)-treated control and saxagliptin (10 mg/kg) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> (10 mg/kg, positive control) initiated 7 days before or 1 day after STZ administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endpoints included changes in body weight, food and water consumption, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (approximately 3 weeks post-STZ), fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and HbA1c and immunohistochemical analyses of the pancreas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Body weight, <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> and food intake were reduced in STZ versus control mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DPP-4 inhibitor treatment did not affect these changes, but the increase in water intake observed post-STZ administration was significantly attenuated with DPP-4 inhibitors whether initiated before or after STZ injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Small but significant improvements in glycaemic control were observed with DPP-4 inhibitors versus the STZ control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Improved β-cell mass and <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> were observed with saxagliptin given pre- or post-STZ and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> given post-STZ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Saxagliptin mitigated damage to β-cells and improved glycaemic control in this mouse model of T2DM </plain></SENT>
