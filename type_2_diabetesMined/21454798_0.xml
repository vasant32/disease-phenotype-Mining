<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We tested whether long-term treatment with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5959">irbesartan</z:chebi> reduces nucleic acid oxidation in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5959">Irbesartan</z:chebi> in Patients With Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>Microalbuminuria</z:mp> (IRMA 2) study was a 2-year multicenter randomized double-blind trial comparing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5959">irbesartan</z:chebi> (150 and 300 mg once daily) with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied a subgroup of 50 patients where urine samples were available for analysis of albumin and the oxidatively modified <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16235">guanine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33838">nucleosides</z:chebi> 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) and 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanosine (8-oxoGuo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the 2-year trial, no significant differences in 8-oxodG and 8-oxoGuo excretions between placebo and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5959">irbesartan</z:chebi> treatment were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>8-oxodG and albumin excretion decreased with time (P = 0.0004 and P &lt; 0.0001, respectively), whereas treatment-related differences were shown for albumin excretion (P = 0.0008) only, as previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Important secondary findings were significant associations between changes in 8-oxodG excretion and changes in albumin excretion and glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA(1c)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the study period, 8-oxodG excretion decreased by 3 and 26% in smokers and nonsmokers, respectively (P = 0.015), and urinary albumin excretion decreased 22% in smokers and 58% in nonsmokers (P = 0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5959">Irbesartan</z:chebi> treatment was not significantly more effective than placebo in reducing nucleic acid oxidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that DNA oxidation in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients is reduced by various components in the treatment of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> where glycemic control seems to be important and addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> does not lead to any substantial additional reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the reductions in DNA oxidation and albumin excretion seem to be counteracted by smoking </plain></SENT>
