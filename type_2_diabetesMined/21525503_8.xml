<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the impact of the mode of exercise on cardiovascular (CV) risk factors in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the literature between 1970 and October 2009 in representative databases for the effect of aerobic or resistance exercise training on clinical markers of CV risk, including glycemic control, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e>, blood pressure, and body composition in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 645 articles retrieved, 34 met our inclusion criteria; most investigated aerobic exercise alone, and 10 reported combined exercise training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Aerobic alone or combined with resistance training (RT) significantly improved HbA(1c) -0.6 and -0.67%, respectively (95% CI -0.98 to -0.27 and -0.93 to -0.40, respectively), systolic blood pressure (SBP) -6.08 and -3.59 mmHg, respectively (95% CI -10.79 to -1.36 and -6.93 to -0.24, respectively), and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> -0.3 mmol/L (95% CI -0.48 to -0.11 and -0.57 to -0.02, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Waist circumference was significantly improved -3.1 cm (95% CI -10.3 to -1.2) with combined aerobic and resistance exercise, although fewer studies and more <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of the responses were observed in the latter two markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Resistance exercise alone or combined with any other form of exercise was not found to have any significant effect on CV markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Aerobic exercise alone or combined with RT improves glycemic control, SBP, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, and waist circumference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The impact of resistance exercise alone on CV risk markers in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> remains unclear </plain></SENT>
