<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To confirm this we examined the association between offspring birthweight and paternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in late adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We did a cross-sectional survey of 4252 men who were 60 to 79 years of age and from 24 British towns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these, 2788 men provided details of their offsprings' birthweight and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Offspring birthweight was inversely associated with paternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> defined by the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) score and with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in late adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fathers of offspring in the highest quartile of sex-standardised birthweight SD scores had a 34% reduction in odds of having a high HOMA <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> score (OR=0.66, 95% CI: 0.47 to 0.92) compared with fathers of offspring in the lowest quartile after adjustment for potential confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A stronger inverse association was seen between offspring birthweight and risk of paternal <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (adjusted OR=0.59, 95% CI: 0.39 to 0.88 top quartile vs lowest quartile) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For each increase of offspring-birthweight SD score the odds of high HOMA scores decreased by 13% (OR=0.87, 95% CI: 0.78 to 0.98) and the odds for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by 17% (OR=0.83, 95% CI: 0.72 to 0.95), after full adjustment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Offspring birthweight is inversely associated with paternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in late adulthood, supporting the hypothesis that genetic factors related to insulin action contribute to the association between birthweight and adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
