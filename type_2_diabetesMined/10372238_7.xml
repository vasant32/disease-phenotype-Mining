<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Most individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are overweight, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> for them is an important therapeutic objective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, usual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight-loss</z:hpo> strategies have generally not produced sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pharmacologic agents to assist <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> might be useful, but no long-term data on their effectiveness and safety in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We therefore initiated a 2-year placebo-controlled trial of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight-loss</z:hpo> medications fenfluramine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8080">phentermine</z:chebi> in type 2 diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 44 overweight (&gt; 120% ideal body weight) subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were enrolled in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of fenfluramine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8080">phentermine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects received intensive nutrition counseling, an exercise prescription, and instruction in behavior modification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subjects were randomly assigned to 20 mg fenfluramine three times a day and 37.5 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8080">phentermine</z:chebi> daily (n = 23) or dual placebos (n = 21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> medications were adjusted as necessary to achieve glycemic goals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Changes in weight, glycemia, <z:mp ids='MP_0001548'>lipemia</z:mp>, and blood pressure were assessed every 2 months, as were adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In September 1997, when fenfluramine was withdrawn from the U.S. market, fenfluramine was stopped in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus the length of drug treatment varied, but 16 subjects (8 in each group) reached 12 months of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Only data obtained before the withdrawal of fenfluramine are included in this report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A study termination, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> medications had been reduced in 1 subject in the placebo group (5%) and 11 subjects in the drug treatment group (52%) (P = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Drug treatment resulted in significant reductions in body weight, BMI, and HbA1c at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time points through 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Changes in weight at 6 months were -2.7 +/- 1.4 kg (mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) with placebo treatment and -9.6 +/- 1.5 kg with drug treatment (P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Even though more subjects in the drug treatment group required reductions in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> medications, at 6 months, changes in HbA1c were -0.3 +/- 0.2% with placebo treatment and -1.6 +/- 0.3% with drug treatment (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> were significantly reduced at some time points with drug treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>No serious adverse events attributable to study medications were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Premature study termination decreased the power of our study at later time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>However, our data suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> medications are an effective treatment for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during active <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Whether the benefit persists after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> has stopped remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
