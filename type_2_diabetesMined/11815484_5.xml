<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, an oral C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> minimal model has been proposed and applied to subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (NGT) during graded up-and-down <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion protocols (40-min periods at 4, 8, 16, 8, 4, and 0 mg.kg(-1).min(-1)) and oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These tests are characterized by slow <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> dynamics, which reproduce prandial conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In view of the importance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta-cell dysfunction</z:hpo> in the pathogenesis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, our aim was to test and use the oral minimal model in subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) to identify deranged mechanisms of beta-cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> data from graded up-and-down <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusions were analyzed in nine NGT and four IGT subjects using the classic deconvolution approach and the oral minimal model, and indexes of beta-cell function were derived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An index of insulin sensitivity was also obtained for each subject from minimal model analysis of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin levels achieved during the test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both deconvolution and minimal model analyses revealed that individuals with IGT have a relative defect in the ability to secrete enough insulin to adequately compensate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, minimal model analysis suggests that insulin secretory defect in IGT arises from delays in the timing of the beta-cell response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
