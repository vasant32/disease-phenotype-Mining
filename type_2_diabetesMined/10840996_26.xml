<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that an elevated C3 concentration might be linked to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo>, abnormalities commonly observed in association with the above conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Fasting concentrations of C3 and acylation stimulating protein (ASP, C3adesarg), a cleavage product of C3 recently found to stimulate <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake in vitro, were measured in 33 healthy nondiabetic Pima Indians (14 women and 19 men; age 27 +/- 1 and body fat 33 +/- 1%, means +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects were characterized for body composition dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, insulin action (insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal [M], hyperinsulinemic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> clamp), and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (75-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fasting C3 and ASP concentrations were positively correlated (r = 0.43, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fasting C3 concentration was closely related to percent body fat (r = 0.77), M (r = -0.75), and fasting insulin concentration (r = 0.72) (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fasting C3 concentrations remained significantly related to M and fasting insulin after adjusting for percent body fat (partial r = -0.53 and 0.33, both P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo>, fasting C3 concentrations were higher than in those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance--a difference that remained after adjustment for percent body fat and M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found that fasting ASP concentrations were significantly related to percent body fat (r = 0.37, P &lt; 0.05), but not to M or fasting insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In Pima Indians, fasting C3 concentration is closely related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e>, insulin action, and fasting insulin levels and may thus be a mediator for the postulated link between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo>, and possibly <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
