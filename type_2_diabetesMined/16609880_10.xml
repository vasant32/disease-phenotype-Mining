<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanisms by which adiponectin improves insulin sensitivity remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Combining euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp studies with indirect calorimetry and skeletal muscle biopsies, we examined the relationship between plasma adiponectin and parameters of whole-body <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism, and muscle <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase (GS) activity in 51 Caucasians (ten lean, 21 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and 20 with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Plasma adiponectin was significantly reduced in type 2 diabetic compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and lean subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In lean and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects, insulin significantly reduced plasma adiponectin, but this response was blunted in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma adiponectin was positively associated with insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal (r = 0.48), <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> oxidation (r = 0.54), respiratory quotient (r = 0.58) and non-oxidative <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism (r = 0.38), and negatively associated with <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> oxidation during insulin stimulation (r = -0.60) after adjustment for body fat (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most notably, we found a positive association between plasma adiponectin and insulin stimulation of GS activity in skeletal muscle (r = 0.44, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our results indicate that plasma adiponectin may enhance insulin sensitivity by improving the capacity to switch from <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> oxidation and to store <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> as <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> in response to insulin, and that low adiponectin may contribute to impaired insulin activation of GS in skeletal muscle of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
