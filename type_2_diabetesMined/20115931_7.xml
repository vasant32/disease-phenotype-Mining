<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the Dietary Intervention Randomized Controlled Trial (DIRECT) 322 moderately <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> participants were randomized for 2 years to one of three diet groups: low-fat, Mediterranean and low-carbohydrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Differential effects were observed in the sub-group of patients with T2DM at 24 months: participants randomized to the Mediterranean diet, which had the highest intake of dietary fibers and unsaturated to saturated fat ratio, achieved greater significant improvements in fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients who were randomized to the low-carbohydrate diet, which had the minimal intake of carbohydrates, achieved a significant reduction of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although improvements were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups, the low-fat diet was likely to be less beneficial in terms of glycemic control and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interpretation of results from different studies on dietary strategies may be complex since there is often no consistency in diet compositions, calorie restriction, intensity of intervention, dietary assessment or extent of adherence in the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, it seems that low fat restricted calorie diets are effective for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and are associated with some metabolic benefits; however, some recent trials have shown that low carbohydrate diets are as efficient in inducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and in some metabolic measures such as serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> may be even superior to low fat diets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When addressing the issue of diet quality rather than quantity applying the glycemic index may have some added benefits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore special features of the Mediterranean diet have apparent additional favorable effects for patients with T2DM </plain></SENT>
