<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent evidence points to molecules secreted by the adipose tissue, or adipokines, as possible links between increased adipose mass and <z:mp ids='MP_0005266'>metabolic abnormalities</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among these molecules, adiponectin has drawn much attention because of its insulin-sensitizing and antiatherogenic actions, suggesting that genetic deficits in its production or action may contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A meta-analysis of the data published to date supports this hypothesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two independent effects, corresponding to the two linkage disequilibrium blocks that can be identified at the adiponectin locus, appear to be present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the 5' block, the g.-11391G--&gt;A variant has a modest but significant effect on adiponectinemia, with a mean difference between genotypes of 1.64 ng/ml (95% CI 0.88-2.41) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the 3' block, the g.+276G--&gt;T variant is a strong determinant of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and CAD, with minor allele homozygotes having a lower homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA(IR)) index (-0.36 units, 95% CI 0.24-0.47) and a lower cardiovascular risk (odds ratio 0.55, 95% CI 0.38-0.80) than carriers of other genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No consistent effect on BMI or risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is evident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Polymorphisms in the genes coding for the adiponectin receptors may also influence the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and CAD, but data on these genes are still too sparse to draw firm conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In summary, the studies published to date indicate that polymorphisms at the adiponectin locus are indeed predictors of circulating adiponectin levels, insulin sensitivity, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, highlighting the pivotal role of this adipokine in the modulation of metabolism and atherogenesis </plain></SENT>
