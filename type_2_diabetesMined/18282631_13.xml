<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The prevalence of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM) among Emirati subjects is one of the highest in the world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This has been attributed to rising prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> acting on genetically susceptible individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the associations between TCF7L2 polymorphism and DM, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e>, and markers of beta cell function and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in a population-based sample of Emirati subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We genotyped the two TCF7L2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs12255372 and rs7903146 in 368 adult subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) was used to assess beta cell function (HOMA2-%B) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA2-IR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The SNP genotypes were analyzed against disease stage [<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>=0 (n=188), pre-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>=1 (n=85), and DM=2 (n=95)] and against clinical and biochemical measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Age and sex were included as covariates in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> association analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additional adjustments were made for body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference in several analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> disease stage was marginally significantly associated with the frequency of the T variant at rs12255372 (p=0.057; adjusted p=0.017) but not at rs7903146 (p=0.5; adjusted p=0.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Comparison between subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and the combined DM/pre-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> showed a significant association with rs12255372 (OR 1.47, CI 1.04-2.08; p=0.03) but not with rs7903146 (OR 1.16, CI 0.81-1.64; p=0.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We found no association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e>, or with insulin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, HOMA2-%B or HOMA2-IR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The age-standardized prevalence rate for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> was 43.9% in men and 42.1% in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data suggest that TCF7L2 variants are associated with increased risk for DM in Emirati subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We also demonstrate a high prevalence of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> in this population </plain></SENT>
