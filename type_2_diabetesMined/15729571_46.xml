<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to map the genetic loci underlying this phenotype, to further characterise the physiological defects and to identify candidate genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> tolerance was measured in an intraperitoneal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test and genetic determinants mapped in an F2 intercross </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity was measured by injecting insulin and following <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal from the plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To measure beta cell function, insulin secretion and electrophysiological studies were carried out on isolated islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Candidate genes were investigated by sequencing and quantitative <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: C57BL/6J mice showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> insulin sensitivity and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948379" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">impaired insulin secretion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In beta cells, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> did not stimulate a rise in intracellular calcium and its ability to close KATP channels was impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We identified three genetic loci responsible for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="25527">Nicotinamide nucleotide</z:chebi> transhydrogenase (Nnt) lies within one locus and is a nuclear-encoded <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> proton pump </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Expression of Nnt is more than sevenfold and fivefold lower respectively in C57BL/6J liver and islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There is a missense mutation in exon 1 and a multi-exon deletion in the C57BL/6J gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Glucokinase lies within the Gluchos2 locus and shows reduced enzyme activity in liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The C57BL/6J mouse strain exhibits plasma <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> reminiscent of human type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest a defect in beta cell <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism that results in reduced electrical activity and insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>We have identified three loci that are responsible for the inherited impaired plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance and identified a novel candidate gene for contribution to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> through reduced beta cell activity </plain></SENT>
