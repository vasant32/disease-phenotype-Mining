<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play an important role in the regulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover and vascular remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vasoactive factor endothelin (ET)-1 not only causes potent vasoconstriction but also exerts profibrotic and proliferative effects that change vessel architecture, which makes it a likely candidate for a key role in vascular complications of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, this study investigated the regulation of MMP activity of resistance arteries under mild-to-moderate <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> conditions, as seen in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and the relative role of ET receptors in this process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Vessel structure, MMP activity, and ECM proteins were assessed in control Wistar and diabetic Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats treated with vehicle, ET(A) receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> atrasentan (5 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)), or ET(B) receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> A-192621 (15 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)) for 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: M/l ratio was increased in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Atrasentan prevented this increase, whereas A-192621 caused further thickening of the medial layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increased MMP-2 activity in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was prevented by atrasentan treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Collagenase activity was significantly decreased in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and while ET(A) antagonism improved enzyme activity, ET(B) blockade further reduced collagenase levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, collagen deposition was augmented in GK rats, which was reversed by atrasentan but exacerbated with A-192621 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ET-1 contributes to the remodeling of mesenteric resistance arteries in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> via activation of ET(A) receptors, and ET(B) receptors provide vasculoprotective effects </plain></SENT>
