<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: beta-Cells are particularly susceptible to fatty acid-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> associated with decreased insulin receptor/phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/Akt signaling and the activation of stress kinases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the mechanism of fatty acid-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of mouse beta-cells especially as related to the role played by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced Foxo1 activation and whether decreasing Foxo1 activity could enhance cell survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1522248" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Mouse insulinoma</z:e> (MIN6) cells were administered with fatty acids, and the role of Foxo1 in mediating effects on signaling pathways and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was examined by measuring Foxo1 activity and using dominant-negative Foxo1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Increasing fatty acid concentrations (100-400 micromol/l <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30823">oleate</z:chebi>) led to early Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) activation that preceded induction of ER stress markers and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Foxo1 activity was increased with fatty acid administration and by pharmacological inducers of ER stress, and this increase was prevented by JNK inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fatty acids induced nuclear localization of Foxo1 at 4 h when Akt activity was increased, indicating that FoxO1 activation was not mediated by JNK inhibition of Akt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, fatty acid administration for 24 h was associated with decreased insulin signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A dominant-negative Foxo1 adenovirus (Adv-DNFoxo) conferred cells with protection from ER stress and fatty acid-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Microarray analysis revealed that fatty acid induction of gene expression was in most cases reversed by Adv-DNFoxo, including the proapoptotic transcription factor CHOP (C/EBP [CCAAT/enhancer binding protein] homologous protein) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Early induction of JNK and Foxo1 activation plays an important role in fatty acid-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Expressing a dominant-negative allele of Foxo1 reduces expression of apoptotic and ER stress markers and promotes beta-cell survival from fatty acid and ER stress, identifying a potential therapeutic target for preserving beta-cells in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
