<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-eight subjects (age 63 ± 11.6 years) with type 2 DM and serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> &lt;125 μmol/l were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A CT scan of femoral, posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries was carried out at baseline and at one year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum osteoprotegerin (OPG) and RANKL were measured along with routine biochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-eight percent of patients had baseline VC, 47% with femoral VC, 49% with VC at two sites - femoral and foot, and 4% foot VC alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Age, ethnicity, <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> and eGFR were independent predictors of baseline VC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Baseline calcification was the most important predictor of VC progression and was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects with progression compared to 35% of non-progressors (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Exclusion of demographic factors from models revealed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> and serum OPG levels as independent predictors of both; baseline VC and progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Subjects with type 2 DM and well-preserved renal function had a high prevalence of VC, which was <z:hpo ids='HP_0003678'>rapidly progressive</z:hpo> especially in those with baseline VC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Age, ethnicity, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e>, smoking and eGFR were predictors of baseline VC and progression </plain></SENT>
