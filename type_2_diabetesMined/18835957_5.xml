<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> effects of consumption of monounsaturated (MUFAs) and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="26607">saturated fatty acids</z:chebi> (SAFAs) on endothelial function in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 33 participants were examined after consumption of two different isocaloric meals: one rich in MUFA and one rich in SAFA, in the form of extra-virgin olive oil and butter, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Endothelial function was assessed by determination of flow-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> (FMD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: FMD did not change significantly after the MUFA-rich meal but declined after the SAFA-rich meal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The FMD during the experiment, expressed as incremental area under the curve, increased after the MUFA-rich meal by 5.2 +/- 2.5% and decreased after the SAFA-rich meal by 16.7 +/- 6.0% (Delta = -11.5 +/- 6.4%; P = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Consumption of an SAFA-rich meal is harmful for the endothelium, while a MUFA-rich meal does not impair endothelial function in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
