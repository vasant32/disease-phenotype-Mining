<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is best known as a regulator of seasonal and circadian rhythms; its levels are high during the night and low during the day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, insulin levels also exhibit a nocturnal drop, which has previously been suggested to be controlled, at least in part, by <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This regulation can be explained by the proposed inhibitory action of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> on insulin release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Indeed, both <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> receptor 1A (MTNR1A) and MTNR1B are expressed in pancreatic islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The role of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> in the regulation of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis has been highlighted by three independent publications based on genome-wide association studies of traits connected with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, such as elevated fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and, subsequently, of the disease itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The studies demonstrate a link between variations in the MTNR1B gene, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e>, impaired early phase insulin secretion and beta cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The risk genotype predicts the future development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Carriers of the risk genotype exhibit increased expression of MTNR1B in islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This suggests that these individuals may be more sensitive to the actions of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi>, leading to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948379" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">impaired insulin secretion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Blocking the inhibition of insulin secretion by <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> may be a novel therapeutic avenue for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
