<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: With increased focus on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> epidemics, and the clear benefit of exercise in disease prevention and management, this study determined the lifetime prevalence of health professional advice to exercise among individuals with or at risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey is a nationally representative survey of the U.S. population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the 2002 survey, 26,878 adults responded when asked about ever receiving health professional advice to exercise more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Information on sociodemographic characteristics and health conditions were self-reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk factors were age &gt; or =45 years, non-Caucasian ethnicity, physical inactivity, BMI &gt; or =25 kg/m(2), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 73% of adults with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were told by a health professional to exercise more versus 31% of adults without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proportion receiving advice increased as the number of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk factors increased until reaching similar rates as people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for sociodemographic and clinical factors, the strongest correlates of receiving advice were BMI and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among respondents with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the likelihood of receiving advice did not vary by age, sex, education, or income level but was less likely in Hispanics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Health professionals advised most patients with or at highest risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> to exercise, suggesting recognition of its importance for disease management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As risk factors declined, fewer patients were advised to exercise, suggesting missed opportunities for disease prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, exercise has not increased proportional to exercise advice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The challenge remains converting patient awareness into behavior change </plain></SENT>
