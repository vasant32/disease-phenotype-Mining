<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Plasma FFA concentrations were higher in patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (two way analysis of variance, p less than 0.001) over a plasma insulin concentration which ranged from approximately 5 to 55 mU/l of insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although plasma FFA concentrations were higher in patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at any given insulin concentration, the relative ability of insulin to suppress plasma FFA concentration to half the initial value was comparable in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals and patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, occurring at a plasma insulin concentration of approximately 20 mU/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that plasma FFA levels are regulated over a narrow range of plasma insulin concentrations in humans, and that plasma concentrations are higher than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> throughout this range </plain></SENT>
