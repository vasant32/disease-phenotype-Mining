<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using the provider perspective and a time horizon to the end of the 1-year intervention, we calculate the costs of a telephonic intervention by health educators compared with an active control (print) intervention to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We calculate the cost-effectiveness ratios for a reduction of one percentage point in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c) (A1C), as well as for one participant to achieve an A1C &lt;7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Base-case and sensitivity analysis results are presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The intervention cost $176.61 per person randomized to the telephone group to achieve a mean 0.36 percentage point of A1C improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $490.58 per incremental percentage point of A1C improvement and $2,617.35 per person over a 1-year intervention in achieving the A1C goal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the median (interquartile range) of per capita cost, cost per percentage point reduction in A1C, and cost per person achieving the A1C goal of &lt;7% are $175.82 (147.32-203.56), $487.75 (356.50-718.32), and $2,312.88 (1,785.58-3,220.78), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The costs of a telephonic intervention for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-management support are moderate and commensurate to the modest associated improvement in glycemic control </plain></SENT>
