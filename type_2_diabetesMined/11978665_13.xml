<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Haplotype combination 112/121 and its intrinsic variants (UCSNP43, -19, and -63) identified within the calpain 10 gene are associated with increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Mexican-Americans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated whether this haplotype combination and its constituent haplotypes and variants contribute to increased susceptibility to impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (IFG)/<z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a South Indian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two study groups were used: 95 families ascertained through a proband with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 468 subjects recruited as part of an urban survey (69.1% with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, 12.8% with IFG/IGT, and 18.2% with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The four-locus haplotype combination 1112/1121 (UCSNP44, -43, -19, and -63) in South Indians conferred both a 10.7-fold increased risk for IFG/IGT (P = 0.001) and a 5.78- to 6.52-fold increased risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the two study groups (families P = 0.025, urban survey P = 0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A combination of the 1112 haplotype with the 1221 haplotype also appeared to increase risk for both IFG/IGT and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Contrary to what might be expected, quantitative trait analysis in the families found that transmission of the disease-related 1121 and 1112 haplotypes was associated with a reduced hip size and lower waist-to-hip ratio, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study supports the paradigm that specific haplotype combinations of calpain 10 variants increase risk of both IFG/IGT and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the relative infrequency of the "at-risk" combinations in the South Indian population suggests that calpain 10 is not a common determinant of susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
