<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Experimental and clinical work over the last 6 years has confirmed and broadened, but also challenged, the incretin concept </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> component of the entero-insular axis is still poorly defined, especially the peptidergic nerves, of which several contain insulinotropic regulatory <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The incretin effect is preserved after complete denervation of the porcine pancreas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Type 2 (non insulin-dependent) diabetic patients have a significantly decreased incretin effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>GIP (gastric inhibitory <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi>; <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> dependent insulin releasing <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>) remains the strongest incretin factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Its secretion depends on the absorption of nutrients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the correlation between the GIP response and disturbances of the entero-insular axis in some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017178" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastrointestinal diseases</z:e> and, in particular, Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, is poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, physiological concentrations of exogenous GIP do not produce fully the incretin effect and injection of GIP antibodies does not abolish the incretin effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This suggests the existence of additional humoral incretin factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, GIP seems to have direct metabolic effects independent of its insulinotropic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The incretin effect of oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> is smaller if plasma levels of C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> rather than insulin are measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, decreased hepatic extraction of insulin after <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> ingestion only accounts partially for the incretin effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>GIP is unlikely to be the gut factor which regulates hepatic insulin extraction </plain></SENT>
