<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Participants underwent symptom-limited maximal GXTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Questionnaires and physical examinations were used to determine demographic, anthropometric, metabolic, and health status predictors of abnormal GXT results, which were defined as an ST segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> &gt; or =1.0 mm, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001681'>angina pectoris</z:hpo>, poor postexercise heart rate recovery (&lt;22 bpm reduction 2 min after exercise), or maximal exercise capacity less than 5.0 METs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Systolic blood pressure response to exercise was examined as a continuous variable, without a threshold to define abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Exercise-induced abnormalities were present in 1,303 (22.5%) participants, of which 693 (12.0%) consisted of impaired exercise capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ST segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> occurred in 440 (7.6%), <z:mp ids='MP_0001629'>abnormal heart rate</z:mp> recovery in 206 (5.0%), <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp> in 63 (1.1%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in 41 (0.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of potential predictors, only greater age was associated with increased prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Other predictors were associated with some, but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Systolic blood pressure response decreased with greater age, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found a high rate of abnormal GXT results despite careful screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In this cohort of overweight and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, greater age most consistently predicted abnormal GXT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Long-term follow-up of these participants will show whether these abnormalities are clinically significant </plain></SENT>
