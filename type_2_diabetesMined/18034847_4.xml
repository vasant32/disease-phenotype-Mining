<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Next to its antithrombotic effects, several lines of evidence demonstrate anti-inflammatory properties of aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We determined the effects of aspirin on <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> - represented by C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) - in type 2 diabetic subjects without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> and assessed differential effects of aspirin 300 mg compared with 100 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover trial was performed in 40 type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In two periods of 6 weeks, patients used 100 or 300 mg aspirin and placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma CRP and IL-6 levels were measured before and after both periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Use of aspirin resulted in a CRP reduction of 1.23 +/- 1.02 mg/l (mean +/- s.e.m.), whereas use of placebo resulted in a mean increase of 0.04 +/- 1.32 mg/l (P = 0.366) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Aspirin reduced IL-6 with 0.7 +/- 0.5 pg/ml, whereas use of placebo resulted in a mean increase of 0.2 +/- 0.8 pg/ml (P = 0.302) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in effects on CRP and IL-6 between 100 and 300 mg aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that a 6-week course of aspirin does not improve low-grade <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, although a modest effect could not be excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No significant differential effects between aspirin 100 and 300 mg were found </plain></SENT>
