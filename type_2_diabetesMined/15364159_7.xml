<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied cross-sectionally 64 non-smoking outpatients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> without clinical evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> attended at Brazilian University General Hospital aged 59.5 +/- 8.1 years and with a known duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> of 11.5 +/- 8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Urinary albumin excretion rate (AER) was determined in timed overnight urine samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum alpha(1)-acid <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> (AGP) and plasma fibrinogen were determined by immunoturbidimetry assay and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) was measured by a high-sensitive immunonephelometry assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A higher levels of AGP (P = 0.0000), CRP (P= 0.003) and fibrinogen ( P = 0.0001) were found in microalbuminuric (n = 26) than in normoalbuminuric patients ( n = 38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase proteins were correlated with each other and with AER, respectively (r = 0.67 for AGP; 0.35 for fibrinogen, and 0.41 for CRP, P &lt; 0.01 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that AGP was independently associated with AER along with systolic blood pressure (r2 = 0.49, P = 0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis showed that AGP was independently related to <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> with an odds ratio (95% CI) of 1.16 ((1.08-1.24), P = 0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: According to our results <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase proteins a known markers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> were associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> independently of clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The influence of AGP on AER and <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> needs to be confirmed in prospective studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Intervention studies are necessary to assess whether anti-inflammatory treatment would have a beneficial effect on this <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> complication of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
