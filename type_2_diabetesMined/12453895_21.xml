<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Chronically elevated NPY levels in the hypothalamus, as in genetically <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> ob/ob mice, are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, a syndrome of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000789'>infertility</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it is not known which of the five cloned Y receptors mediate these effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that crossing the Y2 receptor knockout mouse (Y2(-/-)) onto the ob/ob background attenuates the <z:mp ids='MP_0010024'>increased adiposity</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, and increased hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (<z:chebi fb="5" ids="53393">HPA</z:chebi>) axis activity of ob/ob mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with lean controls, ob/ob mice had elevated expression of NPY and agouti-related protein (AgRP) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the arcuate nucleus and decreased expression of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and cocaine- and <z:chebi fb="110" ids="2679">amphetamine</z:chebi>-regulated transcript (CART) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Y2 deletion in ob/ob mice significantly increased the hypothalamic POMC <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression, with no effect on NPY, AgRP, or CART expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>[Y2(-/-)ob/ob] mice were no different from ob/ob littermates with respect to food intake and body weight, and Y2 receptor deficiency had no beneficial effect on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000789'>infertility</z:hpo> or the reduced hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadotropic function of ob/ob mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that Y2 receptors mediate the <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> phenotype of ob/ob mice, possibly via alterations in melanocortin tonus in the arcuate nucleus and/or effects on the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53393">HPA</z:chebi> axis </plain></SENT>
