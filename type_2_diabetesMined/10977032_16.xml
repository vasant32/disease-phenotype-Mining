<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the role of beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity in this disparity among 4 ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: beta-Cell function and insulin sensitivity were assessed in 77 healthy <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-tolerant subjects using a hyperglycemic clamp (18 Asian-Americans, 9 African-Americans, 34 Caucasians, and 16 Mexican-Americans) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A wide range of variation was evident in clinical features of the studied subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity index and the second-phase insulin response differed among the 4 groups (P = 0.0023 and P = 0.0082, respectively), whereas the first-phase insulin response was marginally different (P = 0.1090) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stepwise regression analysis revealed that ethnicity was an independent determinant for the insulin sensitivity index (P = 0.0014) after adjusting for sex, age, diastolic blood pressure, waist-to-hip ratio, and BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also, a compensatory response of beta-cell function was observed among the ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we observed a drastic difference in insulin sensitivity among the different ethnic groups and observed that their beta-cell function compensates for the prevailing insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The difference in the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001952'>abnormal glucose tolerance</z:hpo> in different ethnic groups could be a result of differences in insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
