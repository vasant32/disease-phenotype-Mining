<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For example, there is evidence suggesting that <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> binding protein (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi>) amino acid variants at codons 416 (aspartic acid--&gt;glutamic acid) and 420 (threonine--&gt;lysine) may affect genetic susceptibility to T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study are: (1) to determine the allele, genotype, haplotype and haplotype combination frequencies of those <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> amino acid variants in a Polish population and (2) to examine their role in the genetic susceptibility to T2DM in a Polish population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall 393 individuals were included in this study: 231 T2DM patients and 162 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sequence of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> exon 11, which contains both examined variants, was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Alleles and genotypes were determined based on electrophoresis of the DNA digestion products by specific restriction enzymes HaeIII and StyI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since variants of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> were in very strong linkage disequilibrium, haplotypes could be assigned to phase-unknown individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Differences in distributions between the groups were examined by chi(2) test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At codon 416 the frequency of Asp/Glu alleles was 44.6/55.4% in T2DM patients and 40.7/59.3% in controls (chi(2)=2.1, d.f.=1, P=0.28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At codon 420 the frequency of Thr/Lys alleles were 69.4/30.6% and 71.6/28.4%, (chi(2)=0.41, d.f.=1, P=0.52), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Distribution of genotypes, haplotypes and haplotype combinations were similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the frequency of amino acid variants at codons 416 and 420 of <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> binding protein gene in a Polish population is similar to other Caucasian populations, but differs significantly from other races </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No evidence was found for an association between <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> frequent polymorphisms and T2DM in this population </plain></SENT>
