<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A major goal of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> therapy is to promote the formation of new beta cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Polymorphisms of T cell factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) are associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, negatively regulating beta cell survival and function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we provide evidence for a role of TCF7L2 in beta cell proliferation and regeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Pancreatic sections from three mouse models (high-fat diet, exendin-4 and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi>-treated mice) and from healthy individuals and patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were used to investigate the association of beta cell regeneration and TCF7L2 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To analyse a direct effect of TCF7L2 on duct cell to beta cell conversion, TCF7L2 was overexpressed in isolated exocrine cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TCF7L2 levels correlated with beta cell compensation during high-fat diet feeding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TCF7L2 was increased together with pancreatic duct cell proliferation and differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Small islet-like cell clusters (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICCs</z:e>) that contained TCF7L2 originated in the vicinity of the ductal epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In human isolated exocrine tissue, TCF7L2 overexpression induced proliferation of pancreatic duct cells and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e> formation next to duct cells, an effect dependent on the JAK2/STAT3 pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The present study demonstrates that TCF7L2 overexpression fosters beta cell regeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our findings imply correlation of TCF7L2 levels and new beta cell formation </plain></SENT>
