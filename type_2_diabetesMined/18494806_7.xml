<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present results of 3 months of treatment in Chinese patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> who were inadequately controlled on current treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients received BIAsp 30 treatment with or without oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs (OADs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were categorized according to their treatment prior to entering the study: drug-naive (n = 3697), OAD (n = 4754), insulin (n = 2392) or OAD + insulin (n = 817) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At 3 months, significant reductions from baseline were observed in the mean <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c) (HbA(1c)) (-2.24 +/- 1.67, -2.04 +/- 1.57, -1.82 +/- 1.49 and -1.86 +/- 1.61%), fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (-3.93 +/- 3.12, -3.51 +/- 2.55, -2.99 +/- 2.93 and -3.38 +/- 3.16 mmol/l) and postprandial plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (-7.09 +/- 4.92, -6.51 +/- 4.02, -5.20 +/- 4.31 and -5.50 +/- 4.32 mmol/l) in the drug-naive, OAD, insulin and insulin + OAD groups respectively (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The proportions of patients in each group achieving target HbA(1c) of less than 7% were higher at 3 months (49.5, 51.8, 51.0 and 48.3%) compared with baseline (3.2, 4.2, 7.1 and 8.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0745153" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemic episodes</z:e> (events per patient-year) were lower at the end of the study in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the groups compared with baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0745153" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hypoglycaemic episodes</z:e> were mostly minor and diurnal in nature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A total of 151 adverse drug reactions were reported, of which five were serious adverse drug reaction (SADRs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These SADRs were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> symptoms of local hypersensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The use of BIAsp 30 monotherapy or in combination with OADs in clinical practice was efficacious and safe in Chinese patients with poorly controlled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
