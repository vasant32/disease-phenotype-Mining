<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase activity is required for insulin-stimulated translocation of GLUT4 transporters and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake and utilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, genes encoding the subunits of PI 3-kinase are promising candidate genes for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We recently cloned the catalytic subunit p110beta gene of human PI 3-kinase and reported two nucleotide polymorphisms, -359T/C and -303A/G, in the promoter region of this gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we determined the effects of these polymorphisms on insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied two separate groups of Finnish nondiabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Insulin secretion was evaluated by intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test and insulin sensitivity by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our results showed that the -359T/C and -303A/G polymorphisms did not have a significant effect on fasting plasma insulin levels, insulin secretion, or insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: It is unlikely that the promoter polymorphisms -359T/C and -303A/G of the catalytic subunit p110beta gene of human PI 3-kinase have a major impact on insulin secretion, insulin sensitivity, or the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Finnish subjects </plain></SENT>
