<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This could be due in part to decreased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced flux through glucokinase (GK) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28757">fructose</z:chebi> activates hepatic GK, we examined whether catalytic amounts of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28757">fructose</z:chebi> could restore inhibition of GP by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> in humans with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> fluxes ([3-(3)H]<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>) were measured during euglycemia (5 mmol/l) and after abrupt <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> (10 mmol/l; variable <z:chebi fb="10" ids="4167">dextrose</z:chebi> infusion) under fixed hormonal conditions (somatostatin infusion for 6 h with basal insulin/glucagon/growth hormone replacement) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 10 subjects with moderately controlled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 7 age- and BMI-matched nondiabetic subjects were studied on up to three separate occasions under the following conditions: without <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28757">fructose</z:chebi> (F(-)) or with infusion of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28757">fructose</z:chebi> at two dosages: 0.6 mg/kg center dot min (low F) and 1.8 mg/kg center dot min (high F) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although GP failed to decrease in response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the coinfusion of both doses of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28757">fructose</z:chebi> was associated with comparable decreases in GP in response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> (low F = -27%, high F = -33%; P &lt; 0.01 vs. F(-) at both dosages), which approached the 44% decline in GP observed without <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28757">fructose</z:chebi> in the nondiabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>GP responses to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> were not altered by the addition of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28757">fructose</z:chebi> in the nondiabetic group (low F = -47%, high F = -42%; P &gt; 0.05 vs. F(-)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, the administration of small amounts of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28757">fructose</z:chebi> to type 2 diabetic subjects partially corrected the regulation of GP by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> per se, yet did not affect this regulation in the nondiabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the liver's inability to respond to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, likely caused by impaired GK activity, contributes substantially to the increased GP in these individuals </plain></SENT>
