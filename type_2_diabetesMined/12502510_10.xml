<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in humans is not a single gene disorder but a multifactorial disease caused by the interaction of multiple genes and environmental factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recombinant inbred (RI) strains are a powerful tool for analyzing not only single genetic traits but also multifactorial genetic traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By using the SMXA RI mice, we genetically dissected <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related traits (BMI, nonfasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration, and blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration during intraperitoneal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For minimizing the variation of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance in each strain, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> mice were fed the high-carbohydrate diet and subjected to phenotypic and genetic analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The parental strains, SM/J and A/J, were nondiabetic, and the differences of the mean values of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related traits were small </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> was observed in (SM x A)F1 mice, and marked differences in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related traits were observed in 19 SMXA RI strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In particular, several SMXA RI strains showed markedly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis revealed a locus on chromosome (Chr) 10 contributing significant effect on nonfasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration, as well as six <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related loci on four chromosomes with suggestive evidence of linkage with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The A/J-derived QTLs on Chr 2 and 18 and an SM/J-derived QTL on Chr 10 contributed to the impairment of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance and/or the increase of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The present study indicates that QTLs derived from parental SM/J and A/J genomes, both of which are nondiabetic, interact in the RI genomes, leading to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> and diabetic phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Genetic dissection of this kind of diabetogenesis will increase our understanding of the complex gene-gene interaction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>mode of inheritance</z:hpo> in human type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
