<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In mammalian cells the UPR is mediated by at least three ER-localized sensors/transducers, and the cellular response and susceptibility to ER stress is likely to be cell-type specific to some degree </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we review the response of pancreatic β-cells or islets to ER stress induced by pharmacological agents, misfolded insulin expression, excessive nutrient exposure and in animal models of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This review highlights the particular importance of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17300">PERK</z:chebi>-mediated translational control and the transcriptional response in pancreatic β-cells and how these relate to the highly specialized function of β-cells, namely <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-regulated insulin secretion and production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We examine how <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> ER stress may prematurely 'age' the β-cell or cause its genetic reprogramming to either reduce its ability to mount a cell survival response to ER stress, or impair <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both could contribute to β-cell failure in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also explore the therapeutic potential of targeting the UPR to preserve β-cell function </plain></SENT>
