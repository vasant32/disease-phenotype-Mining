<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During this study period, a total of 9,242,259 school students underwent the screening program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of them, 54 children, 19 males and 35 females, aged 11.6+/-2.4 years, were diagnosed to have SPT1D by this method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The overall incidence of SPT1D was 0.57/100,000/year, which was about one fifth of that of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> detected by the same method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence was significantly higher in junior high school students than in primary school students (0.32 vs. 1.13/100,000/year, p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SPT1D accounts for one third of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> pediatric cases of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Japan, showing that this clinical form is not rare in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no significant changes in the incidence of SPT1D during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Japanese children is quite low in comparison with Caucasian populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This incidence, regardless of the clinical form of the disease, does not seem to be influenced by environmental factors in contrast with that of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
