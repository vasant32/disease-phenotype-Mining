<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of islet cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> in youth clinically diagnosed with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and describe associated clinical and laboratory findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Children (10-17 years) diagnosed with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were screened for participation in the Treatment Options for Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> in Adolescents and Youth (TODAY) study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Measurements included GAD-65 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021670" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">insulinoma</z:e>-associated protein 2 autoantibodies using the new National Institute of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> and Digestive and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Kidney Diseases</z:e>/National Institutes of Health (NIDDK/NIH) standardized assays, a physical examination, and fasting <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>, C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, and A1C determinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 1,206 subjects screened and considered clinically to have type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 118 (9.8%) were antibody positive; of these, 71 (5.9%) were positive for a single antibody, and 47 were positive (3.9%) for both antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> autoantibody (DAA) positivity was significantly associated with race (P &lt; 0.0001), with positive subjects more likely to be white (40.7 vs. 19%) (P &lt; 0.0001) and male (51.7 vs. 35.7%) (P = 0.0007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BMI, BMI z score, C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, A1C, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, and blood pressure were significantly different by antibody status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The antibody-positive subjects were less likely to display characteristics clinically associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> phenotype, although the range for BMI z score, blood pressure, fasting C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, and serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> overlapped between antibody-positive and antibody-negative subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>Obese</z:mp> youth with a clinical diagnosis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may have evidence of islet <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> contributing to insulin deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As a group, patients with DAA have clinical characteristics significantly different from those without DAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, without islet autoantibody analysis, these characteristics cannot reliably distinguish between <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> young individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and those with autoimmune <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
