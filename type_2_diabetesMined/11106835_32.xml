<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> is associated with changes in self-care behaviour and use of health and social services in older subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a community based, case-control study of subjects registered with general practices participating in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> Wales Research into Elderly (AWARE) <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 396 patients aged 65 years or older with known <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> were compared with 393 age- and sex-matched, non-diabetic controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adjusted odds ratio estimates of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> performance on Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Clock Drawing Test (numbers and hands) were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Information on self-care behaviours and use of services was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 283 (71%) diabetic subjects scored 24 or more on MMSE, compared with 323 (88%) of controls (OR 0.54, P&lt;0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean (S.D.) scores were 24.5 (5.1) and 25.7 (4.3), respectively (difference between means 1.22; 95% CI 0.56, 1.88; P&lt;0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clock testing demonstrated that 257 (65%) and 286 (72%) diabetic subjects correctly placed the numbers and hands, respectively, compared with 299 (76%) and 329 (84%) of controls (OR 0.59, P&lt;0.001 and P&lt;0.52, P&lt;0.0005, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both test scores declined with increasing age, earlier school leaving age and deteriorating visual acuity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of other variables examined, only need for oral hypoglycaemic drugs or insulin, history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> and symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0259749" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autonomic neuropathy</z:e> significantly impaired one or more cognitive test scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The odds ratios (95% CI) for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cognitive test results in subjects with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after adjusting for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significant variables was 0.74 (0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>56, 0.97), P=0.029 for MMSE scores and 0.63 (0.44, 0.93), P=0.019, and 0.58 (0.38, 0.89), P=0.013, for the numbers and hands parts of the clock test, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In comparison with diabetic subjects with no evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, diabetic subjects with an MMSE score &lt;23 were significantly less likely to be involved in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-care (P&lt;0.001) and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> monitoring (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A low MMSE score was also significantly associated with higher hospitalisation in the previous year (P=0.001), reduced ADL (activities of daily living) ability (P&lt;0.001) and increased need for assistance in personal care (P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Elderly subjects with predominantly Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> display significant excess of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e>, associated with poorer ability in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-care and greater dependency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Routine screening of cognition in older subjects with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is recommended </plain></SENT>
