<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The NH(2)-terminal portion of the precursor of brain natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (Nt-proBNP) has been reported to be elevated in left ventricular dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> is a split product from the proBNP molecule, and its level in the circulation is not, as the mature BNP <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, dependent on the peripheral number of BNP receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to test the hypothesis that asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction (ALVD), as estimated by Nt-proBNP, would be more prevalent in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> without overt <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> in comparison with matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study population consisted of 253 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 230 matched control subjects aged 40-70 years without any overt <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> from primary care centers in Western Finland and Southern Sweden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nt-proBNP was measured in plasma by competitive enzyme immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were shown to have higher Nt-proBNP values (360.9 pmol/l [262.6-467.9]) than control subjects (302.7 pmol/l [215.4-419.2]) (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nt-proBNP levels were independently related to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after adjustment for age, sex, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, BMI, heart rate, drug treatment, serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, and cystatin C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the secretion of Nt-proBNP is increased in type 2 diabetic patients with no overt <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>, suggesting that type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is associated with a higher prevalence of ALVD than hitherto thought </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nt-proBNP may thus serve as a screening instrument to select patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who could benefit from an echocardiographical examination </plain></SENT>
