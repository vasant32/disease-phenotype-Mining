<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the adiponectin gene is a promising candidate gene for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) +45T/G and +276G/T of the adiponectin gene as predictors for the conversion from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the STOP-<z:mp ids='MP_0002057'>NIDDM</z:mp> trial, which aimed to investigate the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> compared with placebo on the prevention of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared with the TT genotype, the G-allele of SNP +45 was associated with a 1.8-fold risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (95% CI 1.12-3.00, P = 0.015) in the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects treated with placebo and simultaneously having the G-allele of SNP +45 and the T-allele of SNP +276 (the risk genotype combination) had a 4.5-fold (1.78-11.3, P = 0.001) higher risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with subjects carrying neither of these alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Women carrying the risk genotype combination had an especially high risk of conversion to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (odds ratio 22.2, 95% CI 2.7-183.3, P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the G-allele of SNP +45 is a predictor for the conversion to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the combined effect of SNP +45 and SNP +276 on the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was stronger than that of each SNP alone </plain></SENT>
