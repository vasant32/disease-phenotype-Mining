<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine prevalence estimates in order to monitor <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, particularly type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, in American Indian youth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: To explore the feasibility of developing a case definition using information from primary care records, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> youth aged &lt;20 years with an outpatient visit or hospitalization for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were identified from the Billings Area Indian Health Service database in Montana and Wyoming from 1997 to 1999, and the medical records were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Classification for probable type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was based on age &lt; or =5 years, weight per age &lt; or =15th percentile at diagnosis, or positive results of islet cell antibody test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Classification for probable type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was based on weight per age &gt; or =85th percentile or presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000956'>acanthosis nigricans</z:hpo> at diagnosis, elevated C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> or insulin, family history for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, or use of oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi> with or without insulin or absence of current treatment 1 year after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 52 case subjects with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were identified, 3 of whom had <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> secondary to other conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining 49 case subjects, 25 (51%) were categorized as having probable type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 14 (29%) as having probable type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and 10 (20%) could not be categorized because of missing or negative information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prevalence estimates for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types, type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were 2.3, 0.6, and 1.1, respectively, per 1,000 youth aged &lt;20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our definitions may be useful for surveillance in primary care settings until further studies develop feasible case definitions for monitoring trends in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among youth </plain></SENT>
