<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cellular levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> proteins, cellular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> DNA content, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> function and <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> were assessed by MitoTracker staining and electron microscopy, in white adipose tissue of 12-week-old male <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (ob/ob), and diabetic (db/db) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> proteins were found to be very similar in the livers and muscles of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the mice studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, levels were greatly decreased in the adipocytes of db/db mice, but not in those of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and ob/ob mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> DNA were also found to be considerably reduced in the adipocytes of db/db mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MitoTracker staining and under electron microscopy revealed that the number of mitochondria was reduced in adipocytes of db/db mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Respiration and fatty acid oxidation studies indicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction in adipocytes of db/db mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, there was an increase in mitochondria and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> protein production in adipocytes of db/db mice treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>, an agent that enhances insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Taken together, these data indicate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> loss in adipose tissue is correlated with the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
