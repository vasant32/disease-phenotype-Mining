<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether atypical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (ADM) is present in the Chinese population in Hong Kong </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The records of Chinese patients who attended the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Clinic at Queen Mary Hospital were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We identified 11 patients who initially presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001953'>diabetic ketoacidosis</z:hpo> but subsequently displayed clinical features more typical of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Metabolic studies and HLA typing were performed to characterize this group of Chinese patients with ADM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> response of the patients with ADM 1 h after a standard meal was intermediate between that of type 1 diabetic patients (matched for age and duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) and that of nondiabetic control subjects (matched for age and BMI) (analysis of variance, P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity measured by a short insulin tolerance test was not significantly different between patients with ADM and their matched nondiabetic control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HLA typing showed that none of the patients with ADM had the DR3 allele and that the frequency of DR9 was not increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only one patient had significantly increased levels of antibodies to GAD and islet cell antigen 512 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ADM, which was first described in African-Americans, is seen also in Chinese subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These patients have significant residual C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> secretory capacity and should not be misdiagnosed and treated as patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with life-long insulin therapy </plain></SENT>
