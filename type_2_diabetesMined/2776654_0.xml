<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A series of 220 cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> lasting 1-25 years (mean 8.75 +/- 4.9 years) constituted the subject of study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The age of patients ranged from 31 to 77 years (mean: 63.3 +/- 9.9 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean period of effective management with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> equalled 8.75 +/- 4.9 years and was slightly longer in men (9.2 +/- 5.2 years) than in women (8.3 +/- 4.6 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the duration of effective treatment were found to be inversely proportional </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The treatment of patients who developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> before the 50th year of age was effective longer (X 10.1 +/- 5.3 years) than that of those with later <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of disease (X 7.9 +/- 4.5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This difference was statistically significant (P less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the period of drug effectiveness was significantly longer in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> men (10.1 +/- 5.5 years) than in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> women (8.8 +/- 4.2 years, P less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between secondary failure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> on the one hand and smoking and familial occurrence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on the other </plain></SENT>
