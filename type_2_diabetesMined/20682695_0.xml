<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because currently available antiobesity and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs have limited efficacy and/or safety concerns, identifying new medicinal agents, such as ginsenoside Rb1 (Rb1) as reported here, offers exciting possibilities for future development of successful antiobesity and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Changes in feeding behavior after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> intraperitoneal administration of Rb1 and the effects of intraperitoneal Rb1 for 4 weeks on body weight, energy expenditure, and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> rats were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also examined the effects of Rb1 on signaling pathways and neuropeptides in the hypothalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> intraperitoneal Rb1 dose-dependently suppressed food intake without eliciting signs of toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This inhibitory effect on feeding may be mediated by central mechanisms because Rb1 stimulated c-Fos expression in brain areas involved in energy homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this, Rb1 activated the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway and inhibited NPY gene expression in the hypothalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four-week administration of Rb1 significantly reduced food intake, body <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>, and body fat content and <z:mp ids='MP_0004889'>increased energy expenditure</z:mp> in HFD-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Rb1 also significantly decreased fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005292'>improved glucose tolerance</z:mp>, and these effects were greater than those observed in pair-fed rats, suggesting that although Rb1's antihyperglycemic effect is partially attributable to reduced food intake and body weight; there may be additional effects of Rb1 on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results identify Rb1 as an antiobesity and antihyperglycemic agent </plain></SENT>
