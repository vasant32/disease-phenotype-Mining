<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to develop a Chinese version of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Quality of Life measure (DQOL), appropriate for elderly Chinese immigrants with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and evaluate its reliability and validity through psychometric testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using an established <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> quality of life measure, we employed focus groups to modify the instrument to be appropriate for an elderly Chinese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The revised version was forward translated and back translated by four individuals independently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A review committee consensus determined the final version, which was pre-tested on five lay people to assess the equivalence of meaning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Elderly Chinese patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 70) attending either an endocrinology or family practice clinic near Toronto were recruited to complete the Chinese version of the DQOL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reliability of the instrument was assessed by evaluating internal consistency, item-internal consistency and test-retest reliability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Divergent validity was assessed to show that the instrument could detect worsening quality of life associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Chinese version of the DQOL consists of 42 items and three scales including satisfaction, impact and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related worry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The DQOL and its three scales had high degrees of internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.76-0.92) and excellent test-retest reliability (Pearson correlation = 0.94-0.99) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> items had high correlation with their hypothesized scale with the exception of three items </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Divergent validity of the instrument was demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study provides evidence for the reliability and validity of this Chinese version of the DQOL measure for an elderly Chinese population with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This instrument may be used in future studies to better understand the quality of life of the Chinese population with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
