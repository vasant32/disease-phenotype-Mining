<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have characterized the concerted regulation by insulin (3-h hyperinsulinemic clamp) of the expression of 10 genes related to insulin action in skeletal muscle and in subcutaneous adipose tissue, and we have verified whether a defective regulation of some of them could be specifically encountered in tissues of type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Basal <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels (determined by reverse transcriptase-competitive polymerase chain reaction) of insulin receptor, insulin receptor substrate-1, p85alpha phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), p110alphaPI3K, p110betaPI3K, GLUT4, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15889">sterol</z:chebi> regulatory-element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) were similar in muscle of control (n = 17), type 2 diabetic (n = 9), type 1 diabetic (n = 9), and nondiabetic <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (n = 9) subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In muscle, the expression of hexokinase II was decreased in type 2 diabetic patients (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In adipose tissue, SREBP-1c (P &lt; 0.01) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was reduced in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (nondiabetic and type 2 diabetic) subjects and was negatively correlated with the BMI of the subjects (r = -0.63, P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Insulin (+/-1,000 pmol/l) induced a two- to threefold increase (P &lt; 0.05) in hexokinase II, p85alphaPI3K, and SREBP-1c <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels in muscle and in adipose tissue in control subjects, in insulin-resistant nondiabetic <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients, and in hyperglycemic type 1 diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Upregulation of these genes was completely blunted in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study thus provides evidence for a specific defect in the regulation of a group of important genes in response to insulin in peripheral tissues of type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
