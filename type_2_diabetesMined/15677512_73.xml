<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is unknown whether higher levels of adiponectin are associated with a reduced risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> (CHD) among diabetic individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the association between plasma adiponectin levels and incidence of CHD among 745 men with confirmed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Participants were aged 46-81 years and were free of diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> at the time of blood draw in 1993/1994 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During an average of 5 years of follow-up (3,980 person-years), we identified 89 incident cases of CHD (19 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and 70 coronary artery bypass surgery), confirmed by medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Levels of adiponectin were inversely associated with BMI and directly associated with age, alcohol intake, and duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for age, BMI, smoking, alcohol consumption, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and other lifestyle factors, adiponectin was associated with a decreased risk for CHD events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The multivariate relative risk for CHD for a doubling of adiponectin was 0.71 (95% CI 0.53-0.95) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further adjustment for <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> attenuated this association (0.78 [0.57-1.06]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The inverse association between adiponectin and CHD was consistent across strata of aspirin use, family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, alcohol consumption, insulin use, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and levels of HbA(1c), <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, C-reactive protein, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests that <z:mp ids='MP_0004892'>increased adiponectin levels</z:mp> are associated with a moderately decreased CHD risk in diabetic men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This association seems to be mediated in part by effects of adiponectin on <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
