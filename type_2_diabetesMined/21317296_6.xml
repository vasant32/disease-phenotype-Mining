<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is associated with fewer circulating APCs, APC dysfunction, and impaired endothelial repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We set out to determine whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> adversely affects APCs and endothelial regeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We quantified APCs and assessed APC mobilization and function in mice hemizygous for knockout of the insulin receptor (IRKO) and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) littermate controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endothelial regeneration after femoral artery wire injury was also quantified after APC transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IRKO mice, although <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerant, had fewer circulating Sca-1(+)/Flk-1(+) APCs than WT mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Culture of mononuclear cells demonstrated that IRKO mice had fewer APCs in peripheral blood, but not in bone marrow or spleen, suggestive of a mobilization defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Defective vascular endothelial growth factor-stimulated APC mobilization was confirmed in IRKO mice, consistent with reduced endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (eNOS) expression in bone marrow and impaired vascular eNOS activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Paracrine angiogenic activity of APCs from IRKO mice was impaired compared with those from WT animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Endothelial regeneration of the femoral artery after denuding wire injury was delayed in IRKO mice compared with WT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Transfusion of mononuclear cells from WT mice normalized the impaired endothelial regeneration in IRKO mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Transfusion of c-kit(+) bone marrow cells from WT mice also restored endothelial regeneration in IRKO mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, transfusion of c-kit(+) cells from IRKO mice was less effective at improving endothelial repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo> impairs APC function and delays endothelial regeneration after arterial injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These findings support the hypothesis that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> per se is sufficient to jeopardize endogenous vascular repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Defective endothelial repair may be normalized by transfusion of APCs from insulin-sensitive animals but not from insulin-resistant animals </plain></SENT>
