<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: African-American women, age &gt; or =40 years with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, were recruited from central North Carolina to participate in three sequential phases: 1) Seven focus groups were convened and transcripts evaluated to generate questions and identify plausible domains; 2) Ten one-on-one cognitive response interviews were performed to ensure clarity and cultural appropriateness of the questions; and 3) 217 women participated in psychometric evaluation to establish the internal consistency and validity of the instrument </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three broad categories--mental, physical, and social well-being--captured important issues generated during the focus groups. "My <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>" was added during the cognitive response interviews as a way of separating the impact of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from coexisting issues that affect health status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The response option was changed from a six- to a four-point Likert scale to accommodate subject preference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using principal components and subsequent promax rotation, we identified two hierarchical domains (mental and social well-being) and a physical symptom index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) of the mental and social well-being subscales are 0.83 and 0.93, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A priori hypothesized correlations between subscales along with each subscale and glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration, physical activity, and a perceived health competence scale helped establish the construct validity of the instrument </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A culturally appropriate disease-specific health status measure for older African-American women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> has been developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We have established the internal consistency, construct validity, and factor analytic properties of the measure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This measure should prove useful for investigators who seek a health status instrument that addresses issues <z:chebi fb="36" ids="30443">germane</z:chebi> to African-American women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
