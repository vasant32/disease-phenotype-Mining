<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We explored the relation between HbA1c (A1C), sex, treatment allocation, and their interactions with behavioral and attitudinal characteristics in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Six years after their <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosis, a population-based sample of 874 primary care patients cluster-randomized to receive structured personal care or routine care reported lifestyle, medication, social support, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related consultations, and attitudes toward <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analyses were applied, split by sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A marked intervention effect on A1C was confined to the structured personal care women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median A1C was 8.4% in structured personal care women and 9.2% in routine care women (P &lt; 0.0001) and 8.5% in structured personal care men and 8.9% in routine care men (P = 0.052) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Routine care women had a 1.10 times higher A1C than structured personal care women, (P &lt; 0.0001, adjusted analysis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Structured personal care women had relatively more consultations than routine care women, but neither number of consultations nor other covariates helped to explain the sex difference in A1C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Irrespective of treatment allocation, women had more adaptive attitudes toward <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> but lacked support compared with men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the observed effect of structured personal care on A1C was present only among women, possibly because they were more inclined to comply with regular follow-up and had a tendency to have a more adaptive attitude toward <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
