<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although metabolic sensitivity to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> may differ between ethnic groups, this has been little studied in childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have therefore examined the associations among <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, and glycemia markers in children of different ethnic origins.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSCross-sectional study of 4,633 9- to 10-year-old children (response rate 68%) predominantly of South Asian, black African-Caribbean, and white European origin (n = 1,266, 1,176, and 1,109, respectively) who had homeostasis model assessments of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-IR), glycemia markers (HbA(1c) and fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> (BMI, waist circumference, skinfold thicknesses, and bioimpedance [fat mass]).RESULTSAll <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> measures were positively associated with HOMA-IR in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ethnic groups, but associations were stronger among South Asians compared to black African-Caribbeans and white Europeans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For a 1-SD increase in fat mass percentage, percentage differences in HOMA-IR were 37.5 (95% CI 33.3-41.7%), 29.7 (25.8-33.8%), and 27.0% (22.9-31.2%), respectively (P interaction &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
