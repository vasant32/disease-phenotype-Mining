<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 30 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, inadequately controlled (HbA(1c)&gt;7.5%) with oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi> (OHAs), were assigned to human insulin 30 min before meals or aspart immediately before meals, both with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> 500 mg t.i.d. for 90 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients then switched to the alternate insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 90 and 180 days, blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> were measured at baseline and every 30 min after test meals, for 3h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HbA(1c) and hypoglycemic events were also assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 3 months, HbA(1c) was significantly reduced with aspart, but not human insulin (-0.4+/-0.7% versus +0.1+/-0.7%, p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During meal tests, blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> area under the curve (AUC) was significantly lower with aspart than human insulin (1240+/-476 min/mmol/l versus 1588+/-766 min/mmol/l, p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>AUCs for <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> were similar for both treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neither group experienced serious hypoglycemic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results encourage treatment with mealtime insulin aspart plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011998'>postprandial hyperglycemia</z:hpo> inadequately controlled by OHAs alone </plain></SENT>
