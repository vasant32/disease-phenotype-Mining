<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) underestimate their risk of developing severe complications, and they do not always understand the risk communication by their caregivers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of an intervention focused on the communication of the absolute 10-year risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) in patients with T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was performed in T2DM patients newly referred to the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Care System (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DCS</z:e>) West-Friesland, a managed-care system in the Netherlands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The intervention group (n = 131) received a six-step <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk communication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Control subjects (n = 130) received standard managed care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome measure was appropriateness of risk perception (difference between actual <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk calculated by the UK Prospective <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study risk engine and risk perception) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Secondary outcome measures were illness perceptions, attitude and intention to change behavior, satisfaction with the communication, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and worry about <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients completed questionnaires at baseline, at 2 weeks (immediately after the intervention), and at 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Appropriateness of risk perception improved between the intervention and control groups at 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This effect disappeared at 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No effects were found on illness perceptions, attitude and intention to change behavior, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and worry about <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients in the intervention group were significantly more satisfied with the communication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This risk communication method improved patients' risk perception at 2 weeks but not at 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Negative effects were not found, as patients did not become anxious or worried after the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk communication </plain></SENT>
