<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We examined the associations of television viewing time with fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) and 2-h postchallenge plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (2-h PG) levels in Australian adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 8,357 adults aged &gt; 35 years who were free from diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and who attended a population-based cross-sectional study (Australian <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> and Lifestyle Study [AusDiab]) were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Measures of FPG and 2-h PG were obtained from an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Self-reported television viewing time (in the previous week) was assessed using an interviewer-administered questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) of insulin sensitivity (HOMA-%S) and beta-cell function (HOMA-%B) were calculated based on fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After adjustment for confounders and physical activity time, time spent watching television in women was positively associated with 2-h PG, log fasting insulin, and log HOMA-%B and inversely associated with log HOMA-%S (P &lt; 0.05) but not with FPG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant associations were observed with glycemic measures in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The beta-coefficients across categories of average hours spent watching television per day (&lt; 1.0, 1.0-1.9, 2.0-2.9, 3.0-3.9, and &gt; or = 4.0) for 2-h PG in women were 0 (reference), 0.009, 0.047, 0.473, and 0.501, respectively (P for trend = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the unique deleterious relationship of sedentary behavior (indicated by television viewing time) and glycemic measures independent of physical activity time and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These relationships differed according to sex and type of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> measurement, with the 2-h PG measure being more strongly associated with television viewing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The findings suggest an important role for reducing sedentary behavior in the prevention of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, especially in women </plain></SENT>
