<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi> causes more <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> and cardiovascular events than other secretagogues or insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data sources were Medline, Embase, Cochrane, and three other web-based clinical trial registers (1966-2005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Parallel, randomized, controlled trials in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> comparing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi> monotherapy with monotherapy using secretagogues or insulin were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Outcomes were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>, glycemic control, cardiovascular events, body weight, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Titles and abstracts of 1,806 publications were reviewed in duplicate and 21 relevant articles identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data on patient characteristics, interventions, outcomes, and validity were extracted in duplicate using predefined criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">Glyburide</z:chebi> was associated with a 52% greater risk of experiencing at least one episode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> compared with other secretagogues (relative risk 1.52 [95% CI 1.21-1.92]) and with 83% greater risk compared with other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> (1.83 [1.35-2.49]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">Glyburide</z:chebi> was not associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events (0.84 [0.56-1.26]), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (0.87 [0.70-1.07]), or end-of-trial weight (weighted mean difference 1.69 kg [95% CI -0.41 to 3.80]) compared with other secretagogues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Limitations included suboptimal reporting of original trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Loss to follow-up exceeded 20% in some studies, and major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> was infrequently reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">Glyburide</z:chebi> caused more <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> than other secretagogues and other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">Glyburide</z:chebi> was not associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, or <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
