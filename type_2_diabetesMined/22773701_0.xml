<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Recent human studies suggested that serum osteocalcin is associated with the cross-talk between bone and energy metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine whether serum osteocalcin level is independently associated with the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed of 1,229 nondiabetic men, aged 25-60 years, who were recruited from the Health Promotion Center, Samsung Medical Center, between January 1997 and December 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were followed regularly at the center on an out-patient basis and during hospitalization for a mean of 8.4 years, and the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the baseline analysis, BMI, body fat percentage, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>, homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> value, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 levels varied inversely with the osteocalcin tertiles, and serum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> levels increased with the osteocalcin tertiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, no differences were observed in fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels across the osteocalcin tertiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> occurred in 90 (7.3%) of the study subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In Cox proportional hazards models, however, no statistical differences in the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> across the osteocalcin tertiles were evident after adjustment of other risk factors for incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite baseline associations with favorable metabolic parameters, the serum osteocalcin level was not associated with the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in middle-aged males </plain></SENT>
