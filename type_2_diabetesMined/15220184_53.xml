<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> arises from a combination of impaired insulin action and defective pancreatic beta-cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Classically, the two abnormalities have been viewed as distinct yet mutually detrimental processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The combination of impaired insulin-dependent <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in skeletal muscle and impaired beta-cell function causes an increase of hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production, leading to a constellation of tissue abnormalities that has been referred to as the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> "ruling triumvirate." Targeted mutagenesis in mice has led to a critical reappraisal of the integrated <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> of insulin action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These studies indicate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue does not necessarily lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, so long as insulin sensitivity in other tissues is preserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additional data suggest a direct role of insulin signaling in beta-cell function and regulation of beta-cell mass, thus raising the possibility that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> may be the overarching feature of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> target tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>I propose that we replace the original picture of a ruling triumvirate with that of a squabbling republic in which every tissue contributes to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the disease </plain></SENT>
