<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study included 220 affected subjects from 29 families in which early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> occurred in multiple generations and was not linked to known MODY genes (MODY gene-negative families) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> individuals underwent an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test and other clinical measurements aimed at investigating the underlying metabolic defect and the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For comparison, 79 affected carriers of MODY3 (hepatocyte nuclear factor [HNF]-1 alpha) mutations were similarly examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Subjects from MODY gene-negative pedigrees were diagnosed with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at an older age (36 +/- 17 vs. 21 +/- 10 years, P = 0.0001) and were more frequently <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (52 vs. 18%, P = 0.0001) than MODY3 individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MODY gene-negative patients who were insulin treated required more exogenous insulin than did MODY3 subjects (0.7 +/- 0.4 vs. 0.45 +/- 0.2 U.kg-1.day-1, P = 0.04), despite similar C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among subjects not treated with insulin, MODY gene-negative subjects had significantly higher serum insulin levels, both fasting (16.5 +/- 15 vs. 6.5 +/- 5 microU/ml, P = 0.027) and 2 h after a <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> load (53 +/- 44 vs. 11 +/- 10, P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They also had higher serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (P = 0.02), higher cholesterol levels (P = 0.02), more <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (P = 0.0001), and more <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Differences persisted when families were matched for age at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate the existence of forms of early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal-dominant</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> that are distinct from MODY and are frequently characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, similar to later-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Because of the Mendelian pattern of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo>, the goal of identifying the genes involved in these forms of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> appears to be particularly feasible </plain></SENT>
