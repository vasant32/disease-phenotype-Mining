<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Inuit population in Greenland, which is highly exposed to POPs due to a high intake of marine mammals, has experienced a rapid increase in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevalence over the last 30 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus the aim was to study the association between POPs and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> and markers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and insulin secretion using a population-based design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 1999 to 2002 the Greenland population study was carried out among adult Inuit living in Greenland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The examination included a 75 g OGTT, anthropometric measurements, a structured interview, and blood tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and serum insulin were analysed, and three defined subclasses of POPs were analysed in a subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Associations were adjusted for age, sex, waist circumference, Inuit heritage, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption and educational level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Data on POPs were available on 692 individuals, 305 men (mean age 50 years) and 387 women (mean age 49 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 10.3%, and 10.5% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of several POPs were exceptionally high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>While no associations were found between POPs and stages of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> or markers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, POPs were significantly inversely associated with stimulated insulin concentrations and homeostasis model assessment of beta cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The study indicates that POPs may affect insulin secretion rather than being involved in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No association was seen between POPs and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> or markers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
