<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The response to treatment for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> typically varies among individuals within a study population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This variation is known as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of treatment response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a comprehensive literature review to identify factors that account for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of treatment response in patients treated for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three databases (PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Library) were searched for articles published in the last 10 years describing investigations of factors associated with treatment response and outcomes among people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> receiving pharmacological treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 43 articles extracted and summarized, 35 (81%) discussed clinical factors, 31 (72%) described sociodemographic factors and 17 (40%) reported on comorbidity or behavioural factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical factors identified included baseline glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c or fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) levels, insulin response or sensitivity, C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, body composition, adipose tissue proteins, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile, plasma albumin levels and duration of disease or insulin treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other factors identified included age, sex, race, socioeconomic status and comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This review identified the following research gaps: use of multiple definitions for response, few patient-reported measures and lack of evidence regarding whether factors were associated with treatment response for only specific medications or across pharmacological therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, identification of factors associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treatment response was generally a secondary objective in the research reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Understanding which patient subgroups are more likely to respond to treatment and identifying factors associated with response may result in targeted treatment decisions and alter the interpretation of efficacy or effectiveness of results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, accounting for these factors in clinical trials and when making clinical treatment decisions may improve therapy selection and individual patient outcomes </plain></SENT>
