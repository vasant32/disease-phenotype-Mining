<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Retrospective collection of information (basic patient data, treatment received for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidaemia</z:e>, clinical measurements, complications, life-style management, etc.) on paper form and prospective collection of blood samples for HbA(1c) assessment were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Means, proportions and associated factors were analyzed using non-parametric and logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequency of EOD (&lt;30 years) varies in different Asian countries (0.4-5.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overweight (BMI&gt;or=23 kg/m2) was common in both EOD (60%) and LOD (66%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EOD was characterized by significantly higher levels of HbA(1c) (median 8.9% versus 7.9%) and FPG (median 9.8 mmol/L versus 8.3 mmol/L) but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was less common (43% versus 59%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">Lipid</z:chebi> profiles (cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>) were similar between both groups of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>Cataract</z:hpo> was more common in LOD and was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> age and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration whereas an increase in frequency of advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015397" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">eye disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> and history of photocoagulation was found in EOD cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In addition to diabetic control and duration of the disease, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> age conferred risk to certain subsets of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> complications in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> population </plain></SENT>
