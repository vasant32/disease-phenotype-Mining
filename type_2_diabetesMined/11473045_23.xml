<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This risk is greater among those whose mothers were diabetic during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To define the <z:mp ids='MP_0005266'>metabolic abnormalities</z:mp> predisposing individuals in these high-risk groups to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we conducted a series of studies to measure insulin secretion and insulin action in healthy adult Pima Indians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 104 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-tolerant subjects, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin secretory response (AIR) to a 25-g intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> challenge correlated with the age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the mother (r = 0.23, P = 0.03) and, in multiple regression analyses, the age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the father (P = 0.02), after adjusting for maternal age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and after allowing for an interaction between these terms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, insulin action (hyperinsulinemic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> clamp) did not correlate with the age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the parents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To determine whether early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the parents affected insulin secretion in the offspring across a range of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations, responses to a stepped <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion were measured in 23 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Insulin secretion rates were lower in individuals whose mothers had developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> before 35 years of age (n = 8) compared with those whose parents remained nondiabetic until at least 49 years of age (n = 15) (average insulin secretory rates: geometric mean [95% CI] 369 [209-652] vs. 571 [418-780] pmol/min, P = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, the AIR was lower in individuals whose mothers were diabetic during pregnancy (n = 8) than in those whose mothers developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at an early age but after the birth of the subject (n = 41) (740 [510-1,310] vs. 1,255 [1,045-1,505] pmol/l, P &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, insulin secretion is lower in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerant offspring of people with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This impairment may be worsened by exposure to a diabetic environment in utero </plain></SENT>
