<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By the time T2DM is clinically diagnosed, only 50% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> beta-cell function remains, leading to altered control of fasting and/or postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this review is to summarize the options for introduction of basal insulin, in particular insulin glargine, and the advantages and disadvantages of using insulin glargine vs. alternative insulins or vs. oral agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall, the studies included in this review show that insulin glargine is associated with a lower risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> vs. both neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin and premixed insulin formulations, alongside clinically important improvements in glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, insulin glargine is associated with greater improvements in glycaemic control vs. intensification of oral therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, insulin glargine should be a preferred option when starting insulin therapy for people with T2DM </plain></SENT>
