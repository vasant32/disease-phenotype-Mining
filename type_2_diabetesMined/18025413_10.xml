<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Visceral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> increases risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This may partly be due to a region-specific resistance to insulin's antilipolytic effect in visceral adipocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether adipose tissue releases the vascular <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> endothelin-1 (ET-1) and whether ET-1 could account for regional differences in lipolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: One group consisted of eleven <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and eleven nonobese subjects in whom ET-1 levels were compared between abdominal subcutaneous and arterialized blood samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A second group included subjects undergoing anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Abdominal subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissues were obtained to study the effect of ET-1 on differentiated adipocytes regarding lipolysis and gene and protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Adipose tissue had a marked net release of ET-1 in vivo, which was 2.5-fold increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In adipocytes treated with ET-1, the antilipolytic effect of insulin was attenuated in visceral but not in subcutaneous adipocytes, which could not be explained by effects of ET-1 on adipocyte differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ET-1 decreased the expression of insulin receptor, insulin receptor substrate-1 and phosphodiesterase-3B and increased the expression of endothelin receptor-B (ET(B)R) in visceral but not in subcutaneous adipocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These effects were mediated via ET(B)R with signals through protein kinase C and calmodulin pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The effect of ET-1 could be mimicked by knockdown of IRS-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ET-1 is released from human adipose tissue and links fat accumulation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It selectively counteracts insulin inhibition of visceral adipocyte lipolysis via ET(B)R signaling pathways, which affect multiple steps in insulin signaling </plain></SENT>
