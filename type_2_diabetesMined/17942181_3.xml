<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Participants with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a group practice were recruited and randomly assigned to the home-based exercise intervention or usual care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants were given <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-management education, instructed to exercise 30 min 5 days/week, and were followed for 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The intervention contained three exercise routines (aerobic and resistance exercises) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Outcomes included changes from baseline at 3 months between groups in body mass index (BMI), quality of life, A1C, and blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-six sedentary adults completed the study: 49% intervention group, 68% women, 47% black, mean age 56.6+/-9.6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using intention to treat analysis, a trend towards improvement between groups for BMI (mean change -0.4 versus 0.1, respectively; P=0.06) was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty-eight percent of the intervention group adhered to 80% of the exercise recommendation and significantly improved BMI (-1.07; P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No other differences were detected between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Home-based exercise interventions have potential to reduce BMI in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results provide variance estimates necessary to power a larger study of longer duration </plain></SENT>
