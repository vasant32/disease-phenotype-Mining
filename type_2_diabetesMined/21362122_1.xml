<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled trial, 47 patients were randomized to placebo or rGLP-1 (1.25, 2.5, 5.0 or 8.5 pmol/kg/min) by CSCI for 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On day 1 (pretreatment) and on day 8, patients underwent monitoring of fasting, postprandial, and 11-h profiles of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and hormones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fasting serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> decreased by 76.2, 53.9, 37.0 and 22.7 mg/dl for the 8.5, 5.0, 2.5 and 1.25 pmol/kg/min rGLP-1 groups, respectively, compared to a decrease of 1.1 mg/dl for placebo (p = 0.0002, 0.005, 0.064 and 0.27, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean 11-h serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> area under the curve decreased by 36.3, 23.3, 16.9 and 10.0% for 8.5, 5.0, 2.5 and 1.25 pmol/kg/min rGLP-1, respectively, compared to no change for placebo (p = 0.0001, 0.0019, 0.012 and 0.14, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean fasting C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> increased dose dependently with rGLP-1 (p = 0.0023 for the highest dose) and decreased with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no serious safety concerns and no instances of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: rGLP-1 produced continuous improvements in glycaemic control across a broad dose range of up to 8.5 pmol/kg/min </plain></SENT>
