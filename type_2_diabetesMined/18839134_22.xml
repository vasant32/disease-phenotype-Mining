<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs9939609 in the fat mass and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> associated gene (FTO) and the rs7566605 SNP located 10 kb upstream of the insulin-induced gene 2 gene (INSIG2) have been proposed as risk factors for common <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We tested for genotype-treatment interactions on changes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-related traits in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Prevention Program (DPP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The DPP is a randomised controlled trial of 3,548 high-risk individuals from 27 participating centres throughout the USA who were originally randomised to receive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi>, intensive lifestyle modification or placebo to prevent the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Measures of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> from computed tomography were available in a subsample (n = 908) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This report focuses on the baseline and 1 year results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The minor A allele at FTO rs9939609 was positively associated with baseline BMI (p = 0.003), but not with baseline <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> or the change at 1 year in any anthropometric trait </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For the INSIG2 rs7566605 genotype, the minor C allele was associated with more subcutaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> (second and third lumbar vertebrae [L2/3]) at baseline (p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, CC homozygotes lost more weight than G allele carriers (p = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In an additive model, we observed nominally significant gene-lifestyle interactions on weight change (p = 0.02) and subcutaneous (L2/3 [p = 0.01] and L4/5 [p = 0.03]) and visceral (L2/3 [p = 0.02]) adipose areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No statistical evidence of association with physical activity energy expenditure or energy intake was observed for either genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Within the DPP study population, common variants in FTO and INSIG2 are nominally associated with quantitative measures of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, directly and possibly by interacting with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> or lifestyle intervention </plain></SENT>
