<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether there are common genetic and environmental factors influencing this cluster in a general population of twin pairs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A multivariate genetic analysis was performed on nine endophenotypes associated with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> from 625 adult twin pairs of the GEMINAKAR study of the Danish Twin Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> endophenotypes showed moderate to high heritability (0.31-0.69) and small common environmental variance (0.05-0.21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In general, genetic and phenotypic correlations between the endophenotypes were strong only within sets of physiologically similar endophenotypes, but weak to moderate for other pairs of endophenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, moderate correlations between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> indices and either <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-related endophenotypes or triacylglycerol levels indicated that some common genetic backgrounds are shared between those components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We demonstrated that, in a general population, the endophenotypes associated with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> apparently do not share a substantial common genetic or familial environmental background </plain></SENT>
