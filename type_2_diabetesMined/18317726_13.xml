<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined insulin secretion during OGTTs and IVGTTs, hepatic and peripheral insulin action, and glucagon and incretin hormone secretion in individuals with i-IFG (n = 18), i-IGT (n = 28) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (NGT, n = 20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> tolerance status was confirmed by a repeated OGTT, during which circulating insulin, glucagon, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent insulinotrophic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (GIP) and glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) levels were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp with [3-3H]<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> preceded by an IVGTT was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Absolute first-phase insulin secretion during IVGTT was decreased in i-IFG (p = 0.026), but not in i-IGT (p = 0.892) compared with NGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hepatic insulin sensitivity was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in i-IFG and i-IGT individuals (p &gt; or = 0.179) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Individuals with i-IGT had peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (p = 0.003 vs NGT), and consequently the disposition index (DI; insulin secretion x insulin sensitivity) during IVGTT (DI(IVGTT))) was reduced in both i-IFG and i-IGT (p &lt; 0.005 vs NGT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the DI during OGTT (DI(OGTT)) was decreased only in i-IGT (p &lt; 0.001), but not in i-IFG (p = 0.143) compared with NGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Decreased levels of GIP in i-IGT (p = 0.045 vs NGT) vs increased levels of GLP-1 in i-IFG (p = 0.013 vs NGT) during the OGTT may partially explain these discrepancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Basal and post-load glucagon levels were significantly increased in both i-IFG and i-IGT individuals (p &lt; or = 0.001 vs NGT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We propose that differentiated preventive initiatives in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetic</z:e> individuals should be tested, targeting the specific underlying metabolic defects </plain></SENT>
