<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Subjects were recruited from the cohort study on the prevention of multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disorders</z:e> and MS in Jiangsu province, China; at the 5 years follow-up period (N=1844) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III Asian criterion was used to define MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In present study, we compared the T2DM risk among individuals with or without MS at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Also the interaction between the IFG and other components of MS were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Subjects with MS had a 2.3 (1.5-3.6) adjusted relative risk (aRR) of developing T2DM when compared with individuals without non-MS at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Incidentally, the aRRs of MS components were 5.4 (2.6-10.8) for IFG, 2.6 (1.2-5.9) for greater waist circumference, 3.5 (1.6-7.4) for elevated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>, 4.7 (2.3-9.9) for elevated blood pressure, and 2.4 (1.1-5.3) for low <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high density lipoprotein</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After further adjustment of the components of MS, only IFG was found to be statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The T2DM risk of individuals combined with IFG increased by the number of other MS components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The result of interaction analysis was SI=1.41 but without significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Subjects with MS were at a higher risk of developing T2DM than those who did not have the syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Also IFG was found to be an excellent predictor of T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, there was not a significant interaction between IFG and the other MS components </plain></SENT>
