<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, animal and clinical studies have suggested that HSP60 plays a role in various diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, few epidemiological studies have demonstrated an association between HSP60 levels and type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, an epidemiological study was conducted to examine the association of HSP60 with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study included 83 type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> patients and 161 controls that were recruited from male employees who received annual health check-ups between 2005 and 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The serum HSP60 levels were measured using the ELISA method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Because the HSP60 levels were not detectable (&lt;3.125 ng/mL) in 48.0% of the study subjects, HSP60 levels were divided into two categories (detectable or undetectable) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A logistic regression analysis showed that the subjects in the undetectable had a 2.03 times higher risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> than those in the detectable after adjustment for age, BMI and rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study was the first epidemiological study to demonstrate an association between type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and HSP60, thus suggesting that HSP60 may play an important role in the type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> pathology </plain></SENT>
