<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used data from the Swedish Twin Registry on 23,539 twins born 1886-1958 who answered questionnaires between 1967 and 1972 and were followed up until 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in relation to BMI and physical activity was assessed by Cox regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Structural equation models were used to estimate genetic and environmental variance components and genetic correlations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> increased with BMI (HR 1.32 [95% CI 1.29, 1.35] per kg/m(2)) and decreased with physical activity (HR 0.56 [95% CI 0.39, 0.80] for high vs low) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Heritability was estimated to be 77% (95% CI 54%, 83%) for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 65% (95% CI 58%, 73%) for BMI, and 57% (95% CI 47%, 67%) for physical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The genetic correlation with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 0.43 (95% CI 0.31, 0.58) for BMI and -0.23 (95% CI -0.46, 0.02) for physical activity, implying that 18% (95% CI 9%, 34%) of the genetic influence on type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is shared with BMI and 5% (95% CI 0%, 20%) with physical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Indications of shared genetic effects are found for BMI and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, which suggests that these traits are partly influenced by the same genetic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, our findings suggest that the genes related to physical activity are essentially different from those associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
