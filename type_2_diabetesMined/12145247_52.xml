<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Recently, much attention has been paid to the possibility that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011998'>postprandial hyperglycemia</z:hpo> may be a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factor</z:e> in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>Oxidative stress</z:mp> has been involved in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e>, and increased plasma levels of nitrotyrosine, a product of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> action, have been found in the plasma of diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0011998'>postprandial hyperglycemia</z:hpo> is accompanied by nitrotyrosine generation and, if so, to explore a possible direct role of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> in such a phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 23 type 2 diabetic patients and 15 matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> healthy subjects were recruited for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two different tests were performed in diabetic patients: a standard meal preceded by regular insulin (0.15 units/kg body wt) or insulin aspart (0.15 units/kg body wt) to achieve different levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011998'>postprandial hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The meal test was also performed in healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 0 min and 1, 2, 4, and 6 h after each meal, blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>, and nitrotyrosine levels were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fasting nitrotyrosine was significantly increased in diabetic patients and was further increased during both meal tests in diabetic subjects but not <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As compared with regular insulin, aspart administration significantly reduced the area under the curve of both glycemia (P &lt; 0.04) and nitrotyrosine (P &lt; 0.03), whereas that of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> was not significantly affected by the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study shows a direct correlation between <z:hpo ids='HP_0011998'>postprandial hyperglycemia</z:hpo> and the production of nitrotyrosine, a marker of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
