<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>One major risk factor of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is the impairment of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced insulin secretion which is mediated by the individual genetic background and environmental factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition to impairment of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced insulin secretion, impaired glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (GLP)1-induced insulin secretion has been identified to be present in subjects with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo>, but little is known about its fundamental mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The state of GLP1 resistance is probably an important mechanism explaining the reduced incretin effect observed in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this review, we address methods that can be used for the measurement of insulin secretion in response to GLP1 in humans, and studies showing that specific <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk genes are associated with resistance of the secretory function of the β-cell in response to GLP1 administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we discuss other factors that are associated with impaired GLP1-induced insulin secretion, for example, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, we provide evidence that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> per se, the genetic background and their interaction result in the development of GLP1 resistance of the β-cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We speculate that the response or the non-response to therapy with GLP1 analogues and/or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-IV) inhibitors is critically dependent on GLP1 resistance </plain></SENT>
