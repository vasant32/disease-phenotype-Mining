<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether women with previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> mellitus (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e>) were screened postpartum for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> according to the Canadian <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CDA</z:e>) guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The 1998 CDA guidelines recommend that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> women diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> be screened postpartum for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> using a 2-h 75-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The impact of and compliance with this expert opinion-based recommendation is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> women who delivered at the Ottawa Hospital in 1997 (pre-guideline) and 2000 (post-guideline) with confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using population-based administrative databases, we determined the proportion of these women who had an OGTT, serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> test, or glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (GHb) test in the first postpartum year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Women who had not undergone any blood work were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 131 women in 1997 and 123 women in 2000 with confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of these, only 69 women in 1997 and 52 women in 2000 had blood work recorded in the database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of these women had an OGTT performed in either period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We found a significant increase in the measurement of serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (50 women pre-guideline [72.1%], 48 women post-guideline [92.3%], P &lt; 0.05) and GHb (8 women pre-guideline [11.6%], 20 women post-guideline [38.5%], P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In our region, physicians are not following the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CDA</z:e> recommendations to screen women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> postpartum with an OGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, we did find a significant increase in the measurement of serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and GHb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Publication of expert opinion-based guidelines did not change the postpartum use of an OGTT in these women but may have increased the use of less reliable screening tests for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
