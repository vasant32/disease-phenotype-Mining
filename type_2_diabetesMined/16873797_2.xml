<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 129 type 2 diabetic patients and 35 age-matched nondiabetic subjects with no apparent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> consecutively admitted to our hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At baseline, total flow volume and resistive index, as an index of vascular resistance, at the popliteal artery was evaluated using gated two-dimensional cine-mode phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed 4.8 +/- 1.5 years (range 3.0-8.2) or until their first event of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On follow-up, 16 patients developed primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> had lower blood flow (P &lt; 0.01) and higher vascular resistance (P &lt; 0.05) than patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When the patients were grouped into tertiles according to their levels of total flow volume (129.6-85.5, 85.3-63.3, and 62.7-23.8 ml/min), Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a higher probability of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> events in patients in the lowest than in patients in the highest (P = 0.0199, log-rank test) tertile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed that the lowest tertile for flow volume (hazard ratio [HR] 8.60, 95% CI 1.61-45.97, P = 0.012), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (3.99, 1.12-14.25, P = 0.033), and smoking status (12.01, 1.21-119.28, P = 0.034) were significant independent predictors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that low blood flow estimates in lower-leg arteries may be predictive for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> events among Japanese patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> even though they have a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ABI </plain></SENT>
