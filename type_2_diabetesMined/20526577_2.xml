<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is not known whether or not the effects of physical activity on mortality rates depend on the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively followed up 577 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were aged 45 to 64 years and were free of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Participants were stratified according to the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> (&lt;or=300 or &gt;300 mg/l) and the degree of physical activity (0-4 metabolic equivalent tasks [MET] or &gt;4 MET) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the association of physical activity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> with risk of mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the 18-year follow-up, 356 patients died, of whom 217 died from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Physically more active patients had significantly reduced total, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> and CHD mortality rates if they did not have <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, physically active proteinuric patients had significantly increased total and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> mortality rates (HR 1.83, 95% CI 1.00-3.36, p=0.049) in univariate analyses, with HR 2.43 (95% CI 1.09-5.40, p=0.030) in multivariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Physical activity reduces total and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> mortality rates in type 2 diabetic patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, in proteinuric patients, no protective effect was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Larger studies are needed to confirm the latter finding and to define which exercise intensity leads to possible harmful effects </plain></SENT>
