<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Although a family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is a strong risk factor for the disease, the factors mediating this excess risk are poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the InterAct case-cohort study, we investigated the association between a family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among different family members and the incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, as well as the extent to which genetic, anthropometric and lifestyle risk factors mediated this association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 13,869 individuals (including 6,168 incident cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) had family history data available, and 6,887 individuals had complete data on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> mediators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Country-specific Prentice-weighted Cox models were fitted within country, and HRs were combined using random effects meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lifestyle and anthropometric measurements were performed at baseline, and a genetic risk score comprising 35 polymorphisms associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was created </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was associated with a higher incidence of the condition (HR 2.72, 95% CI 2.48, 2.99) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adjustment for established risk factors including BMI and waist circumference only modestly attenuated this association (HR 2.44, 95% CI 2.03, 2.95); the genetic score alone explained only 2% of the family history-associated risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The greatest risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was observed in those with a biparental history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (HR 5.14, 95% CI 3.74, 7.07) and those whose parents had been diagnosed with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at a younger age (&lt;50 years; HR 4.69, 95% CI 3.35, 6.58), an effect largely confined to a maternal family history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Prominent lifestyle, anthropometric and genetic risk factors explained only a marginal proportion of the excess risk associated with family history, highlighting the fact that family history remains a strong, independent and easily assessed risk factor for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Discovering factors that will explain the association of family history with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk will provide important insight into the aetiology of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
