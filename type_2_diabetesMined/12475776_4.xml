<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we show that in the simultaneous presence of activatory and inhibitory <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi>, the polymorphism exerts opposite effects on the potencies of these modulators: channel opening through <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16862">nucleoside diphosphates</z:chebi> is facilitated, whereas sensitivity toward inhibition through ATP is slightly decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results support the conclusion that E23K predisposes to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by changing the channel's response to physiological variation of cytosolic <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi>, resulting in K(ATP) overactivity and discrete inhibition of insulin release </plain></SENT>
