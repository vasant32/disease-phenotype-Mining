<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate a novel method for assessing the axon reflex and to determine its value in detecting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The neurogenic flare response to nociceptive stimuli is mediated by an axon reflex involving small unmyelinated C-fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We developed a method to assess this reflex involving skin heating to 44 degrees C to evoke the flare followed by scanning the site using a laser Doppler imager (LDI) to measure the area; we termed this method LDIflare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To confirm its neurogenic nature, we examined the LDIflare in eight healthy subjects before and after topical administration of anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used this technique to detect C-fiber <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 36 subjects were studied: 12 subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> (group DN), 12 subjects without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> (group DC), and 12 age- and sex-matched control subjects (group NC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For comparison, small-fiber function was also assessed using the Computer Aided Sensory Evaluator-IV (CASE IV) (WR Medical Electronics, Stillwater, MN) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the eight healthy control subjects, LDIflare was markedly reduced after topical administration of anesthesia (1.62 [1.45-1.72] vs. 5.2 cm2 [3.9-5.9], P &lt;0.0001), confirming its neurogenic nature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similarly, in neuropathic subjects, LDIflare was significantly smaller compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and diabetic control subjects (LDIflare area: DN 1.3 cm2 [0.9-1.8], NC 5.5 cm2 [3.9-5.8], and DC 2.8 cm2 [2.5-3.8]; P &lt;0.0001 and P=0.01, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The group without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> (DC) also demonstrated a reduced flare compared with the NC group (P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, C-fiber function assessed by evaluating the quantitative thermal thresholds (CASE IV) did not detect a difference between the latter two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the neurogenic nature of the LDIflare and clearly demonstrates loss of C-fiber function in neuropathic subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Moreover, it demonstrates C-fiber dysfunction before its detection by other currently available methods, including CASE IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The LDIflare seems to be a simple objective method to detect early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> and may be of value in assessing therapeutic interventions aimed at preventing or reversing C-fiber dysfunction </plain></SENT>
