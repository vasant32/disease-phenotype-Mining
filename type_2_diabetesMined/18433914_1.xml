<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A population-based random sample of 1364 (participation rate 61%) men and 1461 (65%) women aged 45-74 years participated in a cross-sectional health examination including an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test and physical activity assessment by a self-administered questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Women with screen-detected type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n=110) were physically less active than those with known type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n=68) with differences in the duration of physical activity sessions (multivariate-adjusted P=0.041) and the number of moderate to high intensity exercise sessions per week (multivariate-adjusted P=0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In men no differences in LTPA were observed between individuals with screen-detected (n=126) and with known type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n=109) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study supplies indirect evidence that in women, but not in men, with diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> exercise counselling or other treatment related factors produces the desired increase in LTPA </plain></SENT>
