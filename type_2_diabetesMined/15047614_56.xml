<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> has significant effects on cell proliferation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, the contribution of the <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> to changes in islet structure and function associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is yet to be defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examined the specific effects of <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> blockade on islet structure and function in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six male <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats, 10 weeks of age, were randomized to receive the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35457">angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8024">perindopril</z:chebi> (8 mg/l in drinking water; n = 12), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5959">irbesartan</z:chebi> (15 mg/kg via gavage; n = 12), or no treatment (n = 12) for 10 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results were compared with lean littermates (ZL) (n = 12) studied concurrently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ZDF rats had increased intra-islet expression of components of the <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> correlating with increased intraislet <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Disordered islet architecture, seen in ZDF rats, was attenuated after treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8024">perindopril</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5959">irbesartan</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Islet fibrogenesis was also diminished, as measured by picrosirius staining and expression of collagens I and IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Gene expression of transforming growth factor-beta1 was increased in the ZDF pancreas (ZL, 1.0 +/- 0.1; ZDF, 2.0 +/- 0.3; P &lt; 0.05) and reduced after blockade of the <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> (ZDF + P, 1.3 +/- 0.2; ZDF + I, 1.5 +/- 0.1; vs. ZDF, both P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Improvements in structural parameters were also associated with functional improvements in first-phase insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
