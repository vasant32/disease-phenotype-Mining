<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To clarify the association between the actions of insulin on the vascular wall and on the muscles in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we evaluated insulin-mediated vasodilation and muscle <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake simultaneously using the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> clamp technique and the calculation of total peripheral vascular resistance (TPR) from arterial pulse wave analysis in 19 Japanese patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who had no signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During the clamp study, the plasma <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> (NE) level and plasma renin activity (PRA) increased without showing any significant correlation to the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion rate (GIR); a marker of muscle insulin sensitivity, and no changes of other plasma vasoactive hormone levels were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TPR decreased over time during the clamp study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The decrease of TPR from baseline was 0.88 +/- 0.02 at 1 h (mean +/- S.E.M., P &lt; 0.01) and 0.79 +/- 0.03 at 2 h (P &lt; 0.01), and the relative change in TPR from baseline was negatively correlated with GIR (r = -0.48 at 1 and 2 h; both P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that there is also <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in the vascular wall, and this phenomenon may be associated with muscle <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
