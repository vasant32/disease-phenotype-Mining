<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients in this randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled study were drug-naïve, aged 43-69 years, with baseline <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA1c) 5.9-8.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients received saxagliptin 5 mg once daily; 16 received placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were assessed at baseline and week 12 by intravenous hyperglycaemic clamp (0-180 min, fasting state), and intravenous-oral hyperglycaemic clamp (180-480 min, postprandial state) following oral ingestion of 75 g <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Primary and secondary endpoints were percent changes from baseline in insulin secretion during postprandial and fasting states, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Insulin secretion was calculated by C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> deconvolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 12 weeks, saxagliptin significantly <z:mp ids='MP_0003058'>increased insulin secretion</z:mp> percent change from baseline during the postprandial state by an 18.5% adjusted difference versus placebo (p = 0.04), an improvement associated with increased peak plasma concentrations of intact glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent insulinotropic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the fasting state, saxagliptin significantly <z:mp ids='MP_0003058'>increased insulin secretion</z:mp> by a 27.9% adjusted difference versus placebo (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Saxagliptin also improved glucagon area under the curve in the postprandial state (adjusted difference -21.8% vs. placebo, p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: DPP-4 inhibition with saxagliptin improves pancreatic β-cell function in postprandial and fasting states, and decreases postprandial glucagon concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Given the magnitude of enhancement of the insulin response in the fasting state, further study into the effect of DPP-4 inhibition on the β-cell is warranted </plain></SENT>
