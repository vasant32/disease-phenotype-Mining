<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the relationship between A(1c) levels and mortality in an international prospective cohort study of hemodialysis patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Included were 9,201 hemodialysis patients from 12 countries (Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study 3 and 4, 2006-2010) with type 1 or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and at least one A(1c) measurement during the first 8 months after study entry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Associations between A(1c) and mortality were assessed with Cox regression, adjusting for potential confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The association between A(1c) and mortality was U-shaped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with an A(1c) of 7-7.9%, the hazard ratios (95% CI) for A(1c) levels were 1.35 (1.09-1.67) for &lt;5%, 1.18 (1.01-1.37) for 5-5.9%, 1.21 (1.05-1.41) for 6-6.9%, 1.16 (0.94-1.43) for 8-8.9%, and 1.38 (1.11-1.71) for ≥9.0%, after adjustment for age, sex, race, BMI, serum albumin, years of dialysis, serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, 12 comorbid conditions, insulin use, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, country, and study phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> medications were prescribed for 35% of patients with A(1c) &lt;6% and not prescribed for 29% of those with A(1c) ≥9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A(1c) levels strongly predicted mortality in hemodialysis patients with type 1 or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mortality increased as A(1c) moved further from 7-7.9%; thus, target A(1c) in hemodialysis patients may encompass values higher than those recommended by current guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Modifying <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering medicines for dialysis patients to target A(1c) levels within this range may be a modifiable practice to improve outcomes </plain></SENT>
