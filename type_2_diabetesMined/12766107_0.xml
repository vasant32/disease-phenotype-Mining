<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To clarify the prevalence and major risk factors of reduced flow volume in lower extremities with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ankle-brachial index (ABI) in Japanese patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We recruited 208 consecutive type 2 diabetic patients and 33 age-matched nondiabetic subjects (control group) admitted to our hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two of the patients had low ABI (&lt;0.90) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004417'>intermittent claudication</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral arterial disease</z:hpo> [PAD] group), and 176 patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ABI (&gt;0.9) (non-PAD group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated flow volume and resistive index, as an index of arterial resistance to blood flow, at the popliteal artery using gated two-dimensional cine-mode phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Simple linear regression analysis showed a negative correlation between resistive index and total flow volume in the non-PAD group (r = -0.714, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We defined the means +/- 2 SD of these parameters in the control group as the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range; abnormal resistive index was &gt;1.017, and abnormal flow volume was &lt;50.8 ml/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The non-PAD group was divided according to the levels of these parameters: 80 patients had both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> resistive index and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> flow volume (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group); of 96 patients with higher resistive index, 63 had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> flow volume (borderline group) and 33 had reduced flow volume (reduced group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that the major risk factors for reduced flow volume were age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> (r(2) = 0.303, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of patients without PAD with reduced flow volume in the lower extremities was 16% (n = 33) and comparable with that of patients with PAD with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004417'>intermittent claudication</z:hpo> (n = 32), suggesting that increase in arterial resistance to blood flow may be one of the major causes of lower extremity <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial disease</z:e> in Japan </plain></SENT>
