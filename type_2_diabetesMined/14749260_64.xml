<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since then, studies on calpain 10 have been started in correlation with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and insulin-mediated signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this review, the activation mechanism of calpain by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39124">calcium ions</z:chebi>, which is essential to understand its physiological functions, is discussed on the basis of recent X-ray structural analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Further, special features of the structure of calpain 10 that differ from those of typical micro - or m-calpain used in most studies are summarized together with discussion of the physiological function of calpain with respect to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
