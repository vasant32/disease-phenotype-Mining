<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine trends in nontraumatic lower-extremity <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputations</z:mpath> (LEAs) over an 8-year period in patients with and without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Spain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who underwent an LEA using national hospital discharge data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Discharges were grouped by <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> status: type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and no <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence of discharges attributed to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputations</z:mpath> were calculated overall and stratified by <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> status and year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We calculated length of stay and in-hospital fatality stratified by <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> status and type of LEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From 2001 to 2008, 46,536 minor LEAs and 43,528 major LEAs were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the incidence of minor and major <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputations</z:mpath> decreased significantly from 2001 to 2008 (0.88-0.43 per 100,000 inhabitants and 0.59-0.22 per 100,000 inhabitants, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the incidence of minor and major LEAs increased significantly (9.23-10.9 per 100,000 inhabitants and 7.12-7.47 per 100,000 inhabitants) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hospital stay was similar among type 1 diabetic and type 2 diabetic subjects, according to the type of LEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only in-hospital mortality for minor LEAs among type 1 diabetic subjects decreased significantly (4.0% in 2001 vs. 1.6% in 2008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our national data show a decrease in the incidence of major and minor LEAs in patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and an increase among patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further improvement is necessary in the preventive care and early treatment of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The management of foot lesions, especially among type 2 diabetic patients, is particularly urgent </plain></SENT>
