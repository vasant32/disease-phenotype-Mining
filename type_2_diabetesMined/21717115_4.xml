<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using a Mendelian randomisation approach, we investigated whether there is evidence for a causal role of serum <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> for development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined the associations of serum-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric-acid</z:chebi>-raising alleles of eight common variants recently identified in genome-wide association studies and summarised this in a genetic score with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in case-control studies including 7,504 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients and 8,560 non-diabetic controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared the observed effect size to that expected based on: (1) the association between the genetic score and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> levels in non-diabetic controls; and (2) the meta-analysed <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> level to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The genetic score showed a linear association with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> levels, with a difference of 12.2 μmol/l (95% CI 9.3, 15.1) by score tertile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant associations were observed between the genetic score and potential confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No association was observed between the genetic score and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with an OR of 0.99 (95% CI 0.94, 1.04) per score tertile, significantly different (p = 0.046) from that expected (1.04 [95% CI 1.03, 1.05]) based on the observed <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> difference by score tertile and the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> association of 1.21 (95% CI 1.14, 1.29) per 60 μmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our results do not support a causal role of serum <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> for the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and limit the expectation that <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric-acid</z:chebi>-lowering drugs will be effective in the prevention of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
