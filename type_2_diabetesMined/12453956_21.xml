<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of vitamin E with incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and to do so separately among individuals who did and those who did not report regular use of vitamin supplementation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin Resistance</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Study (IRAS) included 895 nondiabetic adults at baseline (including 303 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> [IGT]), 148 of whom developed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> according to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria during the 5-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At baseline, dietary vitamin E was estimated by a validated food frequency interview, usual supplement use was confirmed by supplement label, and plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22470">alpha-tocopherol</z:chebi> was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analyses were conducted separately for individuals who did (n = 318) and did not (n = 577) use vitamin E supplements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among supplement nonusers, reported mean intake of vitamin E (mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22470">alpha-tocopherol</z:chebi> equivalents [alpha-TE]) did not differ between those who remained nondiabetic (n = 490) and those who developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 87) (10.5 +/- 5.5 vs. 9.5 +/- 4.8 [means +/- SD], respectively, NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for demographic variables, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, physical activity, and other nutrients, the association remained nonsignificant (odds ratio [OR] 0.80, 95% CI 0.13-5.06) for the highest level of intake (&gt; or =20 mg alpha-TE) compared with the lowest level (1-4 alpha-TE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, results for plasma concentration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22470">alpha-tocopherol</z:chebi> showed a significant protective effect both before and after adjustment for potential confounders (adjusted OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.02-0.68, for the highest quintile vs. the lowest quintile; overall test for trend, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among individuals who reported habitual use of vitamin E supplements (at least once per month in the year before baseline; 259 remained nondiabetic and 59 developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>), no protective effect was observed for either reported intake of vitamin E or plasma concentration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22470">alpha-tocopherol</z:chebi> CONCLUSIONS: A protective effect of vitamin E may exist within the range of intake available from food </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This effect may go undetected within studies of high-dose supplement use, which appears to hold no additional protective benefit </plain></SENT>
