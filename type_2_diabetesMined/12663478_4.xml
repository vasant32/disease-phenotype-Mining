<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Current methods for measuring long-term glycemia in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are HbA(1c) and advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which are estimated by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30396">phenyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50978">boronate</z:chebi> affinity chromatography and competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we hypothesize that the intrinsic fluorescence property of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>-AGE (Hb-AGE) may be a simple, accurate, and therefore better index for long-term glycemic status due to its highly specific nature and longer half-life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To establish this contention, in vitro and in vivo experiments were carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The former was performed by incubating commercially available <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> with 5 and 20 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and the latter through experimentally induced (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi>) <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in an animal model (male Wistar rats) to identify the new fluorophore formed due to the nonenzymatic glycosylation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An adduct exhibiting fluorescence at 308/345 nm of excitation/emission wavelengths has been identified and its time-dependent formation established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Under in vitro conditions, the first appearance of the new fluorophore was noticed only after a period of 2 months, whereas under in vivo conditions, it increased significantly after 2 months of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Consistent with the observations, studies on patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> demonstrated an elevated level of this new fluorescent adduct in patients with persisting high levels of plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> for &gt;2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on the results obtained, Hb-AGE appears to be an efficient fluorescence-based biosensing molecule for the long-term monitoring of glycemic control in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
