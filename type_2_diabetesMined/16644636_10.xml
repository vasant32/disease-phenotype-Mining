<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: An adverse fetal environment may permanently modify the effects of specific genes on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, insulin secretion, and insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we assessed a possible interaction of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma2 Pro12Ala polymorphism with prenatal exposure to famine on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We measured plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin concentrations after an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test and determined the PPAR-gamma2 genotype among 675 term singletons born around the time of the 1944-1945 Dutch famine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significant interaction effect between exposure to famine during midgestation and the PPAR-gamma2 Pro12Ala polymorphism was found on the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Ala allele of the PPAR-gamma2 gene was associated with a higher prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> but only in participants who had been prenatally exposed to famine during midgestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similar interactions were found for area under the curve for insulin and insulin increment ratio, which were lower for Ala carriers exposed to famine during midgestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The effects of the PPAR-gamma2 Pro12Ala polymorphism on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin metabolism may be modified by prenatal exposure to famine during midgestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is possibly due to a combined deficit in insulin secretion, as conferred by pancreatic beta-cell maldevelopment and carrier type of the Ala allele in the PPAR-gamma2 gene </plain></SENT>
