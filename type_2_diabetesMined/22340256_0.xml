<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nine patients with T2D and nine control subjects performed 60 min of cycling exercise at ~55% peak power (W(max) ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Skeletal muscle biopsies were obtained at baseline, immediately post and 3-h post exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>GLUT4 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression increased (p &lt; 0.05) to a similar extent immediately post exercise in control (~60%) and T2D (~66%) subjects, and remained elevated (p &lt; 0.05) 3-h post exercise with no differences between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similarly, p-<z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase, p38 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated kinase and proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator-alpha <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression were increased (p &lt; 0.05) post exercise, and were not different between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, a single bout of exercise increased skeletal muscle GLUT4 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in patients with T2D to a similar extent as in control subjects </plain></SENT>
