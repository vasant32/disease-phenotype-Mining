<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: In a recent study, iron chelation with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">deferoxamine</z:chebi> led to improvement of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that decreasing circulating iron stores might improve vascular dysfunction in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003281'>increased serum ferritin</z:hpo> concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 28 type 2 diabetic male patients with serum ferritin levels &gt;200 ng/ml ( approximately 18% of consecutive type 2 diabetic men attending our outpatient clinic) were randomized to iron <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> (three extractions of 500 ml blood at 2-week intervals; group 1A) or to observation (group 1B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>C282Y mutation was absent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vascular reactivity (high-resolution external ultrasound) was evaluated at baseline and at 4 and 12 months thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The two groups of patients were matched for age, BMI, pharmacological treatment, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Endothelium-dependent vasodilation remained essentially unchanged in both groups of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the vasodilation induced by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="24364">glyceryl</z:chebi> trinitrate (GTN) improved significantly after iron <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> (P = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These changes occurred in parallel to decreases in transferrin saturation index and HbA(1c) levels (-0.6%, P &lt; 0.05) only in group 1A patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The best predictor of the modifications in endothelium-independent vasodilation was the change in HbA(1c) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Changes in endothelium-independent vasodilation also correlated with the change in serum ferritin (r = -0.45, P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At 12 months, transferrin saturation index and GTN-induced vasodilation returned to values similar to those at baseline in both groups of subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Iron <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> improves vascular dysfunction in type 2 diabetic patients with high ferritin concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms by which these changes occur should be further investigated </plain></SENT>
