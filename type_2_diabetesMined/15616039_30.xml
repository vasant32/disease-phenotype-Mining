<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The etiology of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is multifactorial, including genetic as well as pre- and postnatal factors that influence several different defects of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis, primarily in muscle, beta-cells, and liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present twin study, we report heritability estimates (h(2)) for measures of insulin secretion, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production (HGP), and intracellular <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> partitioning using gold standard methods (euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp technique, tritiated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion, indirect calorimetry, and intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance testing) among 110 younger (22-31 years of age) and 86 older (57-66 years of age) twins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To obtain a valid estimate of beta-cell function, insulin secretion was adjusted for the individual degree of insulin action (disposition index) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In both age-groups there was a major genetic component in the etiology of insulin secretion that was statistically significantly higher among older twins (young h(2) = 0.75 [0.55-0.86] and old h(2) = 0.84 [0.69-0.92], P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The heritability estimates for peripheral insulin sensitivity (young h(2) = 0.53 [0.28-0.71] and old h(2) = 0.55 [0.20-0.76]) and nonoxidative <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism (young h(2) = 0.50 [0.32-0.64] and old h(2) = 0.48 [0.04-0.72]) were similar in younger and older twins, supporting the notion of both genetic and environmental etiological factors in the control of insulin action and nonoxidative <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results suggested that HGP was predominantly controlled by nongenetic factors in both young and old twins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we provide further evidence for a role of genes in controlling insulin secretion, insulin action, and nonoxidative <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The relative contribution of genes versus environment on in vivo insulin secretion exhibited an age dependency with a slightly greater relative impact of genes among older as compared with younger twins </plain></SENT>
