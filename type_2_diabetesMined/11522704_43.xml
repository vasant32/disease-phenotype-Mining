<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of cigarette smoking, giving up smoking, and primary or secondary pipe or cigar smoking on the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A prospective study followed 7,735 men aged 40-59 years from general practices in 24 British towns for an average of 16.8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Incident cases of physician-diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were ascertained by repeated postal questionnaires and systematic reviews of primary care records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 290 incident cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were found in 7,124 men with no history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cigarette smoking was associated with a significant increase in risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, even after adjustment for age, BMI, and other potential confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The benefit of giving up smoking was only apparent after 5 years of smoking cessation, and risk reverted to that of never-smokers only after 20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in those who switched from smoking cigarettes to pipe or cigars remained equal to the risk in continuing cigarette smokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Men who gave up smoking during the first 5 years of follow-up showed significant <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> and subsequently higher risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than continuing smokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cigarette smoking is an independent and modifiable risk factor for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Smoking cessation is associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> and a subsequent increase in risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but in the long term, the benefits of giving up smoking outweigh the adverse effects of early <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
