<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eight hundred and fourteen <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi>-drug users and 623 non-users were identified from German National Health Surveys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their serum <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi> concentrations and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The associations of <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi> concentrations with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were established by correlation analysis and multivariable regression analysis in <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi>-drug users and non-users separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">Antidiabetic</z:chebi> therapy was considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">Caffeine</z:chebi> concentrations were closely positively correlated to serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels in <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi>-drug users (Spearman r = 0.117, p = 0.001; partial r = 0.102, p = 0.020) particularly in women (Spearman r = 0.155, p &lt; 0.001; partial r = 0.150, p = 0.005) although the correlation was weak as shown by multivariable regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were significantly higher (5.403 +/- 0.033 vs. 5.306 +/- 0.037 mmol/l) whereas the <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> level was significantly lower (0.8941 +/- 0.0026 vs. 0.9024 +/- 0.0030 mmol/l) in <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi>-drug users than in non-users </plain></SENT>
