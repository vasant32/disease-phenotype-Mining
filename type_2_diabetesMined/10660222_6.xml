<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have shown that good glycaemic control can prevent the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> in type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We wished to observe the glycaemic control in patients from different centres in Peninsular Malaysia and the factors that determine it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We recruited 926 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosed before age 40 years from seven different centres, with proportionate representation from the three main ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical history and physical examination were done and blood taken for HbA1c and fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall glycaemic control was poor with geometric mean HbA1c of 8.6% whilst 61.1% of the patients had HbA1c greater than 8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Glycaemic control in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> varied between various centres and ethnic groups, with the best control obtained in Chinese patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant predictors of HbA1c in both type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> include access to nurse educators, ethnic background and WHR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, use of insulin was a significant predictor, while in type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, household income was a significant predictor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Socioeconomic status did not have a significant effect in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the glycaemic control in patients with different educational status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, glycaemic control in big hospitals in Malaysia was poor, and was closely related to the availability of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care facilities and ethnic group, rather than socioeconomic status </plain></SENT>
