<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Two cohorts of beneficiaries (n = 1,665 and 504, respectively) living in two medically underserved areas of New York between 2000 and 2007 were randomized to intensive nurse case management via televisits or usual care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Medicare service use and costs covering a 6-year follow-up period were drawn from claims data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Impacts were estimated using regression analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Informatics for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Education and Telemedicine (IDEATel) did not reduce Medicare costs in either site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Total costs were between 71 and 116% higher for the treatment group than for the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although IDEATel had modest effects on clinical outcomes (reported elsewhere), it did not reduce Medicare use or costs for health services </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The intervention's costs were excessive (over $8,000 per person per year) compared with programs with similar-sized clinical impacts </plain></SENT>
