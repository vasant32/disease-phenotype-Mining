<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In people with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM), the incretin effect is reduced, but the recent advent of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors and glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (GLP)-1 agonists/analogues has enabled restoration of at least some of the function of the incretin system, with accompanying improvements in glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two GLP-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi>/analogues are currently approved for the treatment of T2DM-exenatide (Byetta®, Eli Lilly &amp; Co., Indianapolis, IN, US) and liraglutide (Victoza®, Novo Nordisk, Bagsvaerd, Denmark); a once-weekly formulation of exenatide (Bydureon®, Eli Lilly &amp; Co.) has also been approved by the European Medicines Agency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) has recently published guidance on the use of liraglutide in T2DM, based on evidence from the Liraglutide Effect and Action in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> (LEAD) Phase III trial programme, which compared liraglutide with existing <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering therapies, such as exenatide and insulin glargine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The LEAD programme reported HbA1c reductions from 0.8 to 1.5% with liraglutide (1.2 and 1.8 mg), accompanied by low rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> and some <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>; side effects were primarily gastrointestinal in nature (e.g. <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> and diarrhoea) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on the findings of the LEAD studies and the NICE recommendation, liraglutide now represents an important therapy widely available in the UK for certain patient groups, including those with a body mass index (BMI) ≥35.0 kg/m(2) , and patients with a BMI &lt;35 kg/m(2) who are considered unsuitable for insulin and are failing to meet targets for glycaemic control with oral agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>NICE guidelines still suggest that most patients without considerable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (BMI &lt;35 kg/m(2) ) are probably best managed using insulin therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Evidence also suggests a future role for GLP-1 mimetics in combination with basal insulin </plain></SENT>
