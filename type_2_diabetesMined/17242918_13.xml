<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we investigate the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> on the expression of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism and the resulting metabolic consequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">Rosiglitazone</z:chebi> was administered to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> fa/fa rats for 4 days and to 24 diabetic patients for 12 weeks, then <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression for the genes encoding PEPCK-C, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> PEPCK, adipocyte <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-binding protein, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> kinase, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> lipase and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi>-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was examined in s.c. adipose tissue by real-time RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Glyceroneogenesis was determined using [1-(14)C]<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> incorporation into <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cultured adipose tissue explants from overweight women undergoing plastic surgery were incubated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> for various times before <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> determination and analysis of PEPCK-C protein, activity and glyceroneogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">Rosiglitazone</z:chebi> administration to rats induced the expression of the gene encoding PEPCK-C <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> (PCK1) and PEPCK-C activity in adipose tissue with a resulting 2.5-fold increase in glyceroneogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was accompanied by an improvement in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidaemia</z:e> as demonstrated by the decrease in plasma NEFAs and triacylglycerol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>-treated diabetic patients, PCK1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was raised 2.5-fold in s.c. adipose tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">Rosiglitazone</z:chebi> treatment of adipose tissue explants from overweight women caused a selective augmentation in PCK1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> which reached a maximum of 9-fold at 14 h, while <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> for other genes remained unaffected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Experiments with inhibitors showed a direct and transcription-only effect, which was followed by an increase in PEPCK-C protein, enzyme activity and glyceroneogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These results favour adipocyte glyceroneogenesis as the initial thiazolidinedione-responsive pathway leading to improvement in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
