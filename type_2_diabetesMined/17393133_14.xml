<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied physical fitness, whole-body and hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> turnover, and insulin secretion in young <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> Irish subjects before and after 3 months of aerobic exercise training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesised that exercise alone, with stable diet, should improve insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Anthropometric parameters and maximum volume of oxygen utilisation (VO(2max)) were measured in 13 subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 18 non-diabetic control subjects, matched for age and BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity and hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> turnover were measured using the hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Insulin secretion was assessed from an OGTT and a modified intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Some subjects (seven type 2 diabetic, 14 non-diabetic control subjects) then completed a 12-week supervised aerobic exercise programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> measurements were repeated on completion of the exercise programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Type 2 diabetic subjects had higher WHR, systolic blood pressure and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triacylglycerols</z:chebi> than non-diabetic control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>They were significantly more insulin-resistant as measured both by the clamp and oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>They also displayed marked defects in insulin secretion in response to oral and intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> challenges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Exercise intervention had no significant effect on whole-body or hepatic insulin sensitivity or insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>VO(2max) increased significantly in the non-diabetic control subjects, but not in the type 2 diabetic subjects after exercise training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Young <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are severely insulin-resistant with marked loss of beta cell function compared with control subjects matched for age and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Neither group responded metabolically to aerobic exercise intervention </plain></SENT>
