<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Three hundred case families and 381 control families were interviewed using structured questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The proportion of case children having at least one relative with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> outside the nuclear family was higher than that of control children (50.3 vs. 31.8%, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The proportions of case and control children having relatives with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> occurred more frequently among the case children (9.7 vs. 1.1%, P &lt; 0.001), in the case nuclear families (22.0 vs. 12.9%, P = 0.002) and in relatives outside the case nuclear family (72.0 vs. 62.2%, P = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> not only cluster in the nuclear families of children with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> but are also overrepresented in their extended families </plain></SENT>
