<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We recruited a randomly selected sample of 534 men and 441 women aged 18-75 years with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A single visit review of medical records, interview, physical examination and laboratory tests was collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The WHO criteria for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> were met by 79% [74%, 84%] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty percent [28%, 33%] had a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, 13% [11%, 16%] had <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp>, 15% [13%, 18%] had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, and 23% [21%, 26%] had <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> assessed by a monofilament test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000802'>Erectile dysfunction</z:hpo> was common (43% [38%, 47%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two thirds met the national treatment target for glycaemia (HbA1c &lt;7.5%), one-half the blood pressure target (BP &lt;140/85mmHg), and one-third the target for <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> (total/<z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> &lt;4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, only 13% reached the combined targets for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, blood pressure and cholesterol control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The classical microvascular complications of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> affected a minority of participants while the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> affected the majority </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The gap between guidelines and current clinical practice was substantial given that only one of eight patients reached the combined goals for glycaemia, blood pressure and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> control </plain></SENT>
