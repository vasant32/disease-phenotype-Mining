<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a 6-month randomized, controlled clinical trial involving 144 patients aged &gt;60 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants were randomly assigned to receive routine care (control, n = 48), to the self-monitored blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (SMBG, n = 47) group, or to the u-healthcare group (n = 49) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was the proportion of patients achieving A1C &lt;7% without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> at 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>U-healthcare system refers to an individualized medical service in which medical instructions are given through the patient's mobile phone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients receive a glucometer with a public switched telephone network-connected cradle that automatically transfers test results to a hospital-based server </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Once the data are transferred to the server, an automated system, the CDSS rule engine, generates and sends patient-specific messages by mobile phone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 6 months of follow-up, the mean A1C level was significantly decreased from 7.8 ± 1.3% to 7.4 ± 1.0% (P &lt; 0.001) in the u-healthcare group and from 7.9 ± 1.0% to 7.7 ± 1.0% (P = 0.020) in the SMBG group, compared with 7.9 ± 0.8% to 7.8 ± 1.0% (P = 0.274) in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The proportion of patients with A1C &lt;7% without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> was 30.6% in the u-healthcare group, 23.4% in the SMBG group (23.4%), and 14.0% in the control group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The CDSS-based u-healthcare service achieved better glycemic control with less <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> than SMBG and routine care and may provide effective and safe <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> management in the elderly diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
