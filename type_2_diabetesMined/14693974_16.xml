<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To identify the costs and economic consequences of expected changes in the demand for health care services for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the three main public institutions of the Mexican health care system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The cost evaluation method to estimate direct and indirect costs was based on instrumentation and consensus techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To estimate the costs and epidemiological changes for 2003-2005, three probabilistic models were constructed according to the Box-Jenkins technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Comparing the economic impact in 2003 versus 2005 (P &lt; 0.05), there is a 26% increase in financial requirements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The total amount for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in 2005 (in U.S. dollars) will be 317,631,206, dollars including 140,410,816 dollars in direct costs and 177,220,390 dollars in indirect costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The total direct costs, representing financial requirements to provide health care for expected cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and its main complications in the three main public institutions in Mexico, up to 2005, will be 37,079,587 dollars for the Ministry of Health (or Secretar√≠a de Salud [SSA], serving the uninsured population) and 103,331,235 dollars for the Mexican Social Security Institute, or Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS), and the Institute for Social Security and Services for State Workers, or Instituto de Seguridad y Servicios Sociales de los Trabajadores del Estado (ISSSTE), both of which serve the insured population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that changes in the demand for health care services for patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> will continue with an increasing trend, mainly in the insured population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In economic terms, the results of direct and indirect costs are one of the main challenges to be solved to decrease the economic burden that <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> represents for the population, the health care institutions, and for society as a whole </plain></SENT>
