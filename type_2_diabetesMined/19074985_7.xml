<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine to what extent plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) values influence 5-year <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause and cardiovascular mortality in type 2 diabetic individuals, independently of albumin excretion rate (AER) and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, and its incremental usefulness for predicting individual risk of mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Measurements of CRP were performed in 2,381 of 3,249 (73.3%) subjects as part of the population-based Casale Monferrato Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Its association with 5-year <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause and cardiovascular mortality was assessed with multivariate Cox proportional hazards modeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The C statistic and measures of calibration and global fit were also assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Results are based on 496 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in 11.717 person-years of observations (median follow-up 5.4 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With respect to subjects with CRP &lt; or =3 mg/l, those with higher values had an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.51 (95% CI 1.18-1.92) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality and 1.44 (0.99-2.08) for cardiovascular mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In normoalbuminuric subjects, respective HRs of CRP were 1.56 (1.13-2.15) and 1.65 (1.00-2.74), AER being neither a modifier nor a confounder of CRP association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In analysis limited to diabetic subjects without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>), adjusted HRs were 1.67 (1.24-2.24) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality and 1.36 (0.83-2.24) for cardiovascular mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The improvement in individual risk assessment was marginal when measured with various statistical measures of model discrimination, calibration, and global fit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CRP measurement is independently associated with short-term mortality risk in type 2 diabetic individuals, even in normoalbuminuric subjects and in those without a previous diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Its clinical usefulness in individual assessment of 5-year risk of mortality, however, is limited </plain></SENT>
