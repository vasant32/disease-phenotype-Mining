<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, two-period crossover study, patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with inadequate glycaemic control on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy (i.e. on a stable dose of &gt; or = 1500 mg/day for &gt; or = 6 weeks prior to the screening visit and an <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c) (HbA(1c)) &gt; or = 6.5% and &lt;10% and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) &lt; or = 240 mg/dl) were recruited for participation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 28 patients (baseline HbA(1c) range = 6.5-9.6%) receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> were randomized into one of two treatment sequences: the addition of placebo for 4 weeks followed by the addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> 50 mg twice daily (b.i.d.) for 4 weeks, or vice versa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the end of each treatment period, patients were domiciled for frequent blood sampling over 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was 24-h weighted mean <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (WMG) and secondary endpoints included change in FPG, mean of 7 daily self-blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> measurements (MDG) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24103">fructosamine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>beta-cell function was assessed from <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> concentrations were measured during the 5-h period after a standard breakfast meal by using the C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> minimal model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Despite a carryover effect from period 1 to period 2, the combined period 1 and period 2 results for glycaemic endpoints were statistically significant for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> relative to placebo when added to ongoing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To account for the carryover effect, the period 1 results were also compared between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Following period 1, there were significant least-squares (LS) mean reductions in 24-h WMG of 32.8 mg/dl, significant LS mean reduction from baseline in MDG of 28 mg/dl, FPG of 20.3 mg/dl and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24103">fructosamine</z:chebi> of 33.7 mmol/l in patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> relative to placebo (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When added to ongoing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> therapy, parameters of beta-cell function were significantly improved with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> compared with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> or increases in gastrointestinal adverse events or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> events were observed with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> relative to placebo during this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> 50 mg b.i.d. to ongoing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> therapy improved 24-h glycaemic control and beta-cell function, and was generally well tolerated in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
