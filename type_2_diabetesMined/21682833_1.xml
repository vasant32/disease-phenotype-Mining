<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To assess the efficacy and safety of alogliptin added to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> versus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> monotherapy, in Japanese patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who achieved inadequate glycaemic control on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> plus diet/exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were stabilized on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> 15 or 30 mg/day plus diet/exercise during a 16-week screening period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with HbA1c of 6.9-10.4% were randomized to 12 weeks' double-blind treatment with alogliptin 12.5 or 25 mg once daily or placebo, added to their stable <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was the change in HbA1c from baseline to week 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients had an option to continue in a 40-week, open-label extension study, with those originally randomized to alogliptin remaining on the same dosage regimen while patients treated with placebo were randomly allocated to alogliptin 12.5 or 25 mg (added to their stable <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The change from baseline in HbA1c after 12 weeks was significantly greater with alogliptin 12.5 mg added to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> and alogliptin 25 mg added to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> than with placebo added to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (-0.91 and -0.97% vs. -0.19%; p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Responder rates (HbA1c &lt;6.9% and HbA1c &lt;6.2%) and changes in fasting and postprandial blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels showed a similar positive trend in terms of glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The benefits seen with alogliptin were sustained during the 40-week extension period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Alogliptin added to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> was generally well tolerated; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> was infrequent and increases in body weight were minor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Once-daily alogliptin was effective and generally well tolerated when given as add-on therapy to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> in Japanese patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who achieved inadequate glycaemic control on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> plus lifestyle measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Clinical benefits were maintained for 52 weeks </plain></SENT>
