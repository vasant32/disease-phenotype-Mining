<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity was measured with a + 45 mU.m2(-1).min-1 euglycaemic insulin clamp in combination with indirect calorimetry and infusion of [3-3H]<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>GLUT-4 mRNA was measured using a human GLUT-4 cDNA probe and GLUT-4 protein with a polyclonal antibody specific for the 15 amino acid carboxy-terminal <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both Type 2 diabetic patients and their relatives showed impaired stimulation of total-body <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal by insulin compared with control subjects (29.5 +/- 2.1 and 34.0 +/- 4.8 vs 57.9 +/- 3.1 mumol.kg lean body mass-1.min-1; p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This impairment in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal was primarily accounted for by a reduction in insulin-stimulated storage of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> as <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> (13.0 +/- 2.4 and 15.6 +/- 3.9 vs 36.9 +/- 2.2 mumol.kg lean body mass-1.min-1; p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The levels of GLUT-4 mRNA expressed both per microgram of total <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and per microgram DNA, were higher in the diabetic patients compared with the control subjects (116 +/- 25 vs 53 +/- 10 pg/microgram <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and 177 +/- 35 vs 112 +/- 29 pg/microgram DNA; p less than 0.05, p less than 0.01, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
