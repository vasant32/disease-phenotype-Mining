<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genome-wide scans have mapped a susceptibility locus for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> to chromosome 3q27, where the adiponectin gene is located </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A common silent T-G exchange in nucleotide 94 (exon 2) of the adiponectin gene has been associated with increased circulating adiponectin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005266'>Metabolic abnormalities</z:mp> associated with the G allele have not been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We therefore assessed whether this polymorphism alters insulin sensitivity and/or measures of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> using the TÃ¼bingen Family Study database (prevalence of the G allele, 28%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 371 nondiabetic individuals, we found a significantly greater BMI in GG + GT (25.5 +/- 0.7 kg/m(2)) compared with TT (24.1 +/- 0.3 kg/m(2); P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity (determined by euglycemic clamp, n = 209) was significantly lower in GG + GT (0.089 +/- 0.007 units) compared with TT (0.112 +/- 0.005 units; P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This difference disappeared completely on adjustment for BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Because our population contains a relatively high proportion of first-degree relatives of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we stratified by family history (FHD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Much to our surprise, the genotype differences in BMI and insulin sensitivity in the whole population were attributable entirely to differences in the subgroup without FHD, whereas in the subgroup with FHD, the G allele had absolutely no effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, individuals without FHD had a significantly lower BMI than individuals with FHD (25.2 +/- 0.4 vs. 26.2 +/- 0.5 kg/m(2); P = 0.01), which was not the case for the GG + GT subgroup without FHD (27.0 +/- 0.9 kg/m(2); NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This suggests that in individuals without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001472'>familial predisposition</z:hpo> for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the adiponectin polymorphism may mildly increase the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> risk (and secondarily <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in individuals who are already burdened by other genetic factors, this small effect may be very hard to detect </plain></SENT>
