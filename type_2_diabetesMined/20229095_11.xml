<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Absence of the cholesterol transporter ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) results in increased islet cholesterol and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948379" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">impaired insulin secretion</z:e>, indicating that impaired cholesterol efflux leads to <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta cell dysfunction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we aimed to determine the role of the <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> receptor (LDLr) in islet cholesterol uptake and to assess the contributions of cholesterol uptake compared with efflux to islet cholesterol levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Islet cholesterol and beta cell function were assessed in mice lacking LDLr (Ldlr(-/-)), or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E (Apoe(-/-)), as well as in mice with beta-cell-specific deficiency of Abca1 crossed to Ldlr(-/-) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020443" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hypercholesterolaemia</z:e> resulted in increased islet cholesterol levels and decreased beta cell function in Apoe(-/-) mice but not in Ldlr(-/-) mice, suggesting that the <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> receptor is required for cholesterol uptake leading to cholesterol-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta cell dysfunction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, when <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> islets with functional <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> receptors were transplanted into diabetic, hypercholesterolaemic mice, islet graft function was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> compared with Ldlr(-/-) islets, suggesting that compensatory mechanisms can maintain islet cholesterol homeostasis in a hypercholesterolaemic environment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Indeed, transplanted <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> islets had increased Abca1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, lack of the Ldlr did not protect Abca1(-/-) mice from islet cholesterol accumulation, suggesting that cholesterol efflux is the critical regulator of cholesterol levels in islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our data indicate that islet cholesterol levels and beta cell function are strongly influenced by LDLr-mediated uptake of cholesterol into beta cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cholesterol efflux mediated by ABCA1, however, can compensate in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020443" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercholesterolaemia</z:e> to regulate islet cholesterol levels in vivo </plain></SENT>
