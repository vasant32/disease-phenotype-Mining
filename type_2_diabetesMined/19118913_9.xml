<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This 12-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study was performed in 291 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary assessment was change from baseline to endpoint in HbA1c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Baseline HbA1c averaged 7.4%, and the between-treatment difference (vildagliptin-placebo) in the HbA1c adjusted mean change was -0.8%, -1.0% and -1.2% with vildagliptin 10, 25 and 50mg bid, respectively (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Relative to baseline, body weight did not change significantly in vildagliptin groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no increase in incidence of adverse events in the vildagliptin groups (62.0%, 62.5% and 61.8%, 10, 25 and 50mg bid, respectively) compared to placebo (73.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> or drug-related serious adverse events were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seven hypoglycemic events were observed (four events (n=3), two events (n=2), and one event (n=1) in the vildagliptin 10 and 50mg bid, and placebo, respectively) and none of them were severe or dose related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Vildagliptin 50mg bid was considered to be the most effective and well-tolerated dose, and therefore can be considered the recommended clinical dose for Japanese patients with T2DM </plain></SENT>
