<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>Oxidative stress</z:mp> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> leads to the generation of reactive oxygen species and loss of chromosomal integrity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To clarify whether <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is a <z:mp ids='MP_0003786'>premature aging</z:mp> syndrome, we determined telomere <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosion</z:mpath> dynamics and occurrence of structural chromosomal aberrations in women of the Ludwigshafen Risk and Cardiovascular Health (LURIC) Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Telomere lengths and karyotypes were examined in peripheral blood mononuclear cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regarding these parameters, surviving and deceased type 2 diabetic women of the LURIC study were compared with nondiabetic LURIC women with or without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> and with healthy female control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significantly enhanced telomere attrition was seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> LURIC subjects compared with healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the average telomere-length loss is equivalent to well &gt;10 years of healthy aging, telomere <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosion</z:mpath> was not associated with outcome within the LURIC cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, strikingly high numbers of stable chromosomal aberrations were found in type 2 diabetic women but not in LURIC disease control subjects or in healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, within the younger age- groups, deceased type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients had significantly more marker chromosomes than the surviving type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> women at high risk for cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> have accelerated telomere <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosion</z:mpath>, not caused by type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> per se but likely linked to other risk factors, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>By contrast, the occurrence of marker chromosomes is associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and is a novel risk factor for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
