<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000217'>xerostomia</z:hpo> is a typical syndrome in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complication</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have reported that salivatin (salivary <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> P-C) derived from human saliva potentiates <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin release and inhibits arginine-stimulated glucagon release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study is aimed to gain further evidence on the physiological role by investigating the diabetic state-induced change in the amount of salivatin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The amount of salivatin was measured in saliva taken from patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with ELISA and with rabbit antiserum against human salivatin immunocytochemically in sections of parotid glands from <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi>-diabetic BALB/c mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The amount of salivatin after a meal was reduced by <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in both human saliva and in the serous secretory granule of mouse parotid gland acinar cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The above results suggest that salivatin lowers <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> after meal and sustains the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels by incretin-like mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The function may be damaged by <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and this in turn might make the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> worse </plain></SENT>
