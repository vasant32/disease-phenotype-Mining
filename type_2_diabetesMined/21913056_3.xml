<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is widely hypothesised that the predisposing variation is involved in cis-regulation of TCF7L2 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to seek evidence for the existence of novel TCF7L2 isoforms encoded within the type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-associated genomic region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We searched expressed sequence tag (EST) databases for novel TCF7L2 transcripts and sought to validate the function and integrity of any isoforms found using a combination of RT-PCR, western blotting and reporter gene techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Analysis of EST databases suggested the presence of an alternative polyadenylation site located in intron 4 of TCF7L2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used 3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends and real-time PCR to validate the integrity of this polyadenylation signal and show its wide use across human tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Western blotting results are consistent with the use of this polyadenylation signal to generate novel protein isoforms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The alternative polyadenylation signal results in the production of isoforms that retain the β-catenin binding domain but do not possess the high-mobility group box DNA-binding domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Promoter-reporter gene assays suggest that these isoforms inhibit TCF7L2-dependent target genes by sequestering β-catenin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We have identified a novel polyadenylation signal within TCF7L2 that can result in the production of isoforms that act to repress TCF/LEF-dependent target genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings may provide new insights into the association of TCF7L2 with susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
