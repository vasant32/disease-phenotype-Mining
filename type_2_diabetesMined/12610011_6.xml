<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The dietary habits of 366 type 2 diabetic men and 295 women, aged 45-64 years and free from CHD, were assessed with a 53-item food frequency questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were followed up for 7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Men in the highest tertile of the polyunsaturated/saturated fat (P/S) ratio (&gt;0.28) had a significantly lower risk for CHD <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> than men in the two lowest tertiles (5.0 vs. 14.2%, P = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> CHD events was 14.2 vs. 23.2%, respectively (P = 0.044) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>P/S ratio did not predict CHD events in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In Cox multiple regression analyses taking into account other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, the highest P/S ratio tertile was associated with the lowest rate of CHD <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in men (P = 0.048) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Low P/S ratio in men predicted future CHD events in type 2 diabetic subjects independently of conventional CHD risk factors </plain></SENT>
