<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The association between the E23K polymorphism of ATP-sensitive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> channel subunit Kir6.2 and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> has been reported in Caucasians but not in Asians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined this issue in follow-up and cross-sectional studies in a general Japanese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a 14-year follow-up study of 976 subjects aged 40-79 years with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (NGT), we investigated the impact of the E23K polymorphism on change of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance status using a 75-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we confirmed this association in a cross-sectional survey of 2,862 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the follow-up study, the frequencies of the K/K genotype or K-allele were significantly higher in subjects with conversion from NGT to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than in those in whom NGT was maintained (genotypes, P = 0.01; alleles, P = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, the risk for progression to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was significantly higher in subjects with the E/K (odds ratio 2.10 [95% CI 1.16-3.83]) and K/K (2.40 [1.01-5.70], P for trend = 0.01) genotypes than in those with the E/E genotype after adjustment for confounding factors, namely, age, sex, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, BMI, physical activity, current drinking, and current smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the cross-sectional study, the frequencies of the K/K genotype or K-allele were also significantly higher in those with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than in those with NGT (genotypes, P = 0.006; alleles, P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the Kir6.2 E23K polymorphism is an independent genetic risk factor for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the general Japanese population </plain></SENT>
