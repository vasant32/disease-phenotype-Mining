<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Serum concentration of IL-18 is a strong predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have shown that microinflammation is involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> as well as of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to test the hypothesis that the serum level of IL-18 is a common predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Eighty-two Japanese patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 55 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance &lt;1 ml/s) were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We assessed clinical parameters and measured serum and urinary IL-18 levels, serum IL-6 levels, carotid intima-media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>), and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further, we evaluated changes of urinary albumin excretion rate (AER) after 6 months in 76 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum and urinary IL-18 levels were significantly elevated in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> as compared with control subjects (serum IL-18 179 +/- 62 vs. 121 +/- 55 pg/ml, P &lt; 0.001; urinary IL-18 97 +/- 159 vs. 47 +/- 54 pg/ml, P = 0.035) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Univariate linear regression analysis showed significant positive correlations between serum IL-18 and AER (r [correlation coefficient] = 0.525, P &lt; 0.001), HbA(1c) (r = 0.242, P = 0.029), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) (r = 0.240, P = 0.031), and urinary beta-2 microglobulin (r = 0.235, P = 0.036) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Serum IL-18 levels also correlated positively with carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> (r = 0.225, P = 0.042) and baPWV (r = 0.232, P = 0.040) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We also found a significant correlation between urinary IL-18 and AER (r = 0.309, P = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Multivariate linear regression analysis showed that AER (standard correlation coefficients <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30166">[B]</z:chebi> = 0.405, P &lt; 0.001) and hs-CRP (B = 0.207, P = 0.033) were independently associated with serum IL-18 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>AER was also independently associated with urinary IL-18 levels (B = 0.295, P = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Moreover, serum and urinary IL-18 levels correlated positively with AER after 6 months (r = 0.489, P &lt; 0.001 and r = 0.320, P = 0.005) and changes in AER during the follow-up period (r = 0.268, P = 0.018 and r = 0.234, P = 0.042) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Serum levels of IL-18 might be a predictor of progression of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> as well as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
