<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We refined the association signal by direct genotyping and examined for associations of the variant displaying the most independent effect on FPG with isolated impaired fasting glycemia (i-IFG), isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (i-IGT), type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and measures of insulin release and peripheral and hepatic insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We examined European-descent participants in the Inter99 study (n = 5,553), in a sample of young healthy Danes (n = 372), in Danish twins (n = 77 elderly and n = 97 young), in additional Danish type 2 diabetic patients (n = 1,626) and control subjects (n = 505), in the Data from the Epidemiological Study on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin Resistance</z:hpo> Syndrome (DESIR) study (n = 4,656), in the North Finland Birth Cohort 86 (n = 5,258), and in the Haguenau study (n = 1,461) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The MTNR1B intronic variant, rs10830963, carried most of the effect on FPG and showed the strongest association with FPG (combined P = 5.3 x 10(-31)) and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rs10830963 G-allele increased the risk of i-IFG (odds ratio [OR] 1.64, P = 5.5 x 10(-11)) but not i-IGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The G-allele was associated with a decreased insulin release after oral and intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> challenges (P &lt; 0.01) but not after injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27999">tolbutamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In elderly twins, the G-allele associated with hepatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (P = 0.017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The G-allele of MTNR1B rs10830963 increases risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> through a state of i-IFG and not through i-IGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The same allele associates with estimates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta-cell dysfunction</z:hpo> and hepatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
