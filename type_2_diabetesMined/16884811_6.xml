<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A random sample of 30 pharmacies were allocated into two groups: (i) tick test only (TTO); or (ii) sequential screening (SS) method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both methods used the same initial risk assessment for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects with one or more risk factors in the TTO group were offered a referral to their general practitioner (GP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Under the SS method, patients with risk factors were offered a capillary blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> test and those identified as being at risk referred to a GP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these approaches was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 1286 people were screened over a period of 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rate of diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was significantly higher for SS compared with the TTO method (1.7% versus 0.2%; p=0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The SS method resulted in fewer referrals to the GP and a higher uptake of referrals than the TTO method and so was the more cost-effective screening method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SS is the superior method from a cost and efficacy perspective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It should be considered as the preferred option for screening by community based pharmacists in Australia </plain></SENT>
