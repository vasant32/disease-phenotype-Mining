<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The aim of this study was to study dynamic changes in the prevalence of different types of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in paediatric populations in Poland, with a specific focus on monogenic <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (MD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using epidemiologic data (PolPeDiab Collaboration) and nationwide genetic test results (TEAM Programme), we compared the prevalence of type 1, type 2 and cystic <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>-related <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (CFRD) and MD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genetically confirmed MD included MODY, neonatal <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="27998">Wolfram</z:chebi> and Alstr√∂m syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study covered <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children aged 0-18 years treated for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> between 2005 and 2011 in three regions, inhabited by 23.7% (1,989,988) of Polish children, with a low prevalence of childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (&lt;5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> showed a continuous increase, from 96 to 138/100,000 children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and CFRD also increased, from 0.3 to 1.01/100,000 children and from 0.1 to 0.95/100,000 children, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of MD was stable at between 4.2 and 4.6/100,000 children, accounting for 3.1-4.2% of children with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, with glucokinase (GCK)-MODY being the most frequent type, amounting to 83% of patients with MD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The percentage of positive test results decreased with the number of referrals, suggesting that children with the highest probability of MD were referred initially, followed by those with a less clear-cut phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of neonatal <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> equalled 1 in 300,000 children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The prevalence of MD in a paediatric population with a low prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> remains stable and is nearly fivefold higher than that of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and CFRD, justifying a need for increased access to genetic diagnostic procedures in diabetic children </plain></SENT>
