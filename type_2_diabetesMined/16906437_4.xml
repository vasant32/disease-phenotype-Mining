<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, we assessed genotype-by-sex interaction using a liability threshold model in an attempt to localise sex-specific type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> quantitative trait loci (QTLs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS, MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hypertensive siblings and their offspring and/or parents in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> Genetic Epidemiology Network of the Family Blood Pressure Program were recruited from five field centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diabetic phenotype was adjusted for race, study centre, age and non-linear age effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In total, 567 diabetic individuals were identified in 385 families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Variance component linkage analyses in the combined sample and stratified by sex and race were performed (SOLAR program) using race-specific marker allele frequencies derived from a random sample of participants at each centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We observed a QTL-specific genotype-by-sex interaction (p=0.009) on chromosome 17 at 31 cM, with females displaying a robust adjusted logarithm of odds (LOD) of 3.0 compared with 0.2 in males and 1.3 in the combined sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three additional regions demonstrating suggestive evidence for linkage were detected: chromosomes 2 and 5 in the female sample and chromosome 22 (adjusted LOD=1.9) in the combined sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These findings suggest that multiple genes may regulate susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, demonstrating the importance of considering the interaction of genes and environment in the aetiology of common complex traits </plain></SENT>
