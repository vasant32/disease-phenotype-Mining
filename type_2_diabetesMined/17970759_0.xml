<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The ZDF rats were divided into four medicated groups as follows: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> as a PPARgamma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> (5 mg/kg/day; P group, n = 6), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5001">fenofibrate</z:chebi> as a PPARalpha <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> (30 mg/kg/day; F group, n = 6), both these medications (P + F group, n = 6) and no treatment (UNT group, n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Non-diabetic rats (ZDF/GmiCrl-lean, CON group, n = 6) served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> particle size and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>) levels of the following factors: liver X receptor alpha (L x R alpha), ATP-binding cassette A1 (ABCA1) and ABCG1 which are regulated by PPARs and are related to early stage RCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The significant increase in <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> particle size was demonstrated in rats of the F and P + F groups, although changes in plasma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> levels were not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In accordance with this finding, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of ABCG1 in the liver increased significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest the efficacy of combined therapy with PPARgamma and PPARalpha in improving <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism, partly through the enhanced RCT, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
