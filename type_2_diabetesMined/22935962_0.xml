<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As the underlying mechanisms remain poorly characterised, we investigated its relationship with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, insulin secretion, clearance of insulin and glucagon concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One-thousand two-hundred and seventy-six non-diabetic individuals from the RISC (relationship between insulin sensitivity and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>) study without high alcohol consumption were studied; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had a euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp and an OGTT with assessment of insulin sensitivity, secretion and clearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Alcohol consumption was positively associated with insulin sensitivity in women (β = 0.15, p ( trend ) = 0.005) and in men (β = 0.07, p ( trend ) = 0.07) after controlling for age, centre, waist, smoking and physical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In women, this association persisted after adjustment for adiponectin but was attenuated after controlling for <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi>, suggesting that part of the protection is related to a higher <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Higher alcohol consumption was associated with lower basal insulin secretion in women only (β = -0.10, p ( trend ) = 0.004) and this association persisted after adjustment for insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In men, increasing alcohol consumption was associated with enhanced insulin clearance and increased fasting NEFA concentrations, independently of insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fasting glucagon decreased with increasing alcohol in women only (abstainers 9.2 ± 4.4; &lt;28 g/week 8.6 ± 4.0; 28-64 g/week 8.1 ± 3.7; &gt;64 g/week 7.5 ± 3.1 pmol/l; p ( trend ) = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Light-to-moderate alcohol consumption was associated in healthy women with enhanced insulin sensitivity, reduced basal insulin secretion rate and lower fasting plasma glucagon concentration, providing consistent mechanisms for the reduced risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
