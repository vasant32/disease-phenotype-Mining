<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A young <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is likely to result, in part, from greater genetic susceptibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Young-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> families may therefore represent a group in which genes are more easily detectable by linkage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, we conducted age at diagnosis (AAD) stratified linkage analyses in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> UK Warren 2 sibpairs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the previously published unstratified analysis, evidence for linkage (logarithm of odds [LOD] &gt;1.18) was found at seven loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The LOD scores at these seven loci were higher in the 245 families with AAD &lt;55 years (L55) compared with the 328 families with AAD &gt;55 years (G55) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five of these seven loci (1q24-25, 5q13, 8p21-22, 8q24.2, and 10q23.2) had LOD scores &gt;1.18 in the L55 subset but only one (8p21-22) did in the G55 subset </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two additional loci (8q21.13 and 21q22.2) showed evidence for linkage in the L55 subset alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Another locus (22q11) showed evidence for linkage in a subset of families with AAD &lt;45 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using a locus-counting approach, the L55 subset had significantly more loci (P approximately 0.01) than expected under the null hypothesis of no linkage across the LOD score range 0.59-3.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the G55 subset contained no more susceptibility loci than that expected by chance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, young-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> families provide both disproportionate evidence for linkage to known loci and evidence for additional novel loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our data confirm our hypothesis that families segregating young-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> represent a more powerful resource for defining susceptibility genes by linkage </plain></SENT>
