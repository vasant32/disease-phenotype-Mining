<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to characterize familial risks for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by the type and number of affected family members, including half-siblings, adoptees, and spouses, to quantify risks and estimate the contribution of environmental effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Families were identified from the Multigeneration Register, and type 2 diabetic patients were obtained from the Hospital Discharge Register </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Standardized incidence ratios were calculated for offspring with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> whose family members were hospitalized for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at ages &gt;39 years compared with those lacking affected family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The number of hospitalized type 2 diabetic patients was 157,549 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among 27,895 offspring, 27.9% had a parent or sibling also hospitalized for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The familial relative risk (RR) ranged from 2.0 to &gt;30, depending on the number and type of probands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The highest RRs of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were found in individuals who had at least two siblings affected by type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, irrespective of the parental disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adoptees showed no risk from adopted parents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The study, the largest yet published, showed that familial RRs varied by the number and type of affected family member </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, much of the familial clustering remains yet to be genetically explained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The high risk should be recognized in clinical genetic counseling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The data from adoptees confirmed the genetic basis of the familial associations, but those from half siblings and spouses suggested that a smaller part of familial clustering may be accounted for by environmental factors </plain></SENT>
