<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The evidence with respect to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (IR) and insulin secretion in individuals without type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> has been scarce and elusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined if subjective sleep complaints and their co-occurrence were associated with IR and insulin secretion in adult women and men without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Women (n = 442) and men (n = 354) 18-75 years of age without type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> underwent an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT), with insulin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> measured at fasting and at 30 and 120 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Complaints related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100785'>insomnia</z:hpo>, and daytime sleepiness were self-rated with the Basic Nordic Sleep Questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In comparison with individuals with no or minor sleep complaints, those with more frequent complaints of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100785'>insomnia</z:hpo>, and daytime sleepiness were more insulin resistant, as evidenced by higher fasting insulin concentrations and insulin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> responses to OGTT, and more frequently had high homeostasis model assessment of IR and low insulin sensitivity index values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The likelihood of being insulin resistant increased significantly and linearly according to the accumulation of co-occurring sleep complaints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These associations changed only a little when adjusted for mediating and confounding factors and for depressive symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sleep complaints were not associated with indices of deficiency in insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Subjective sleep complaints were associated with IR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The likelihood of being insulin resistant increased according to accumulation of co-occurring sleep complaints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Sleep complaints were not associated with deficiency in insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
