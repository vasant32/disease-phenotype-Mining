<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Type 2 diabetic subjects of both sexes aged &gt;or=50 years who had a urinary albumin concentration &gt;or=20 mg/l were randomly allocated to 1.25 mg/day <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8774">ramipril</z:chebi> or placebo in addition to their usual treatment and treated for 3-6 years in a double-blind fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Major outcomes including hospitalization for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> were recorded during the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 4912 included patients, 187 developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> during the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> between the two treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using a multivariate analysis, independent risk factors for the occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> were age, history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, baseline urinary albumin concentration, baseline HbA(1c), and smoking habits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 68 of the 187 patients (36.4%) died during the 12 +/- 11-month period after the first hospitalization for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e>, whereas the annual mortality rate of the population who did not develop <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> was 3.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Presence of atherosclerotic disease, baseline urinary albumin concentration, and HbA(1c) level were indicators for further development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> is a major prognostic turn in a diabetic patient's life </plain></SENT>
