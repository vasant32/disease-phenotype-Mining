<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To test the association of undiagnosed Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> with education and income level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We utilized measures of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> status, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, socio-economic status, and demographic characteristics from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) for adults of age 20 and older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We inferred the presence of undiagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> using the criterion of the American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association at the time of NHANES III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association of undiagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with education and income after controlling for other variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Undiagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is not related to education or income </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the sub-population of individuals with diagnosed or undiagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, undiagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is more likely in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals (OR 1.95, 1.01-3.76), but is not related to education or income </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Socio-economic status, as measured by education and income, is not associated with whether or not individuals are likely to have undiagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This finding suggests that screening for Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> should focus on those adults who are at risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in general (based on age, racial/ethnic groups, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and other clinical risk factors) and that socio-economic characteristics are unlikely to provide further information </plain></SENT>
