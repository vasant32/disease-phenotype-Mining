<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several studies have suggested that the common PPARGC1A polymorphism Gly482Ser may be associated with risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, with conflicting results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To clarify the role of Gly482Ser in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and related human metabolic phenotypes we genotyped this polymorphism in a case-control study and performed a meta-analysis of relevant published data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Gly482Ser was genotyped in a type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> case-control study (N=1,096) using MassArray technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A literature search revealed publications that examined Gly482Ser for association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and related metabolic phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Meta-analysis of the current study and relevant published data was undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the pooled meta-analysis, including data from this study and seven published reports (3,718 cases, 4,818 controls), there was evidence of between-study <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> (p&lt;0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the fixed-effects meta-analysis, the pooled odds ratio for risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> per Ser482 allele was 1.07 (95% CI 1.00-1.15, p=0.044) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Elimination of one of the studies from the meta-analysis gave a summary odds ratio of 1.11 (95% CI 1.04-1.20, p=0.004), with no between-study <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> (p=0.475) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For quantitative metabolic traits in normoglycaemic subjects, we also found significant between-study <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, no significant association was observed between Gly482Ser and BMI, fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> or fasting insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: This meta-analysis of data from the current and published studies supports a modest role for the Gly482Ser PPARGC1A variant in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
