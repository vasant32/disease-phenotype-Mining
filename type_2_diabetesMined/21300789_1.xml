<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the association of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011998'>postprandial hyperglycemia</z:hpo> or fasting <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> has not been clarified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We determined the impact of the total spectrum of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> abnormalities on left ventricular (LV) geometry and diastolic function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Two hundred and eighty-seven Japanese subjects who visited the university hospital to be checked for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> or known type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were consecutively recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Participants underwent an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test if they had no history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and LV geometry and LV systolic and diastolic function were analyzed by Doppler echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequency of LV diastolic dysfunction in subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (IFG), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT), newly detected <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and known <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were 13, 22, 50, 51, and 61%, respectively (Ï‡(2) = 54.2, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IGT was a predictor for LV diastolic dysfunction after adjusting for age, sex, systolic blood pressure, and heart rate (odds ratio 3.43 [95% CI 1.09-11.2]), but IFG was not (0.49 [0.06-3.08]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IGT was a predictor after adjusting for established <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> risk factors but was no longer significant after adjusting for BMI and homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this hospital-based registry of subjects without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e>, the prevalence of LV diastolic dysfunction was higher in subjects with IGT but not in those with IFG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results suggest that IGT, as well as newly detected and known <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, could be linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular events, partly through LV diastolic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
