<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine how fitness in both childhood and adulthood is associated with adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A prospective cohort study set in Australia in 2004-2006 followed up a cohort of 647 adults who had participated in the Australian Schools Health and Fitness Survey in 1985 and who had undergone anthropometry and cardiorespiratory fitness assessment during the survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Outcome measures were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, defined as a homeostasis model assessment index above the 75th sex-specific percentile and BMI &gt;or=30 kg/m(2), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Lower levels of child cardiorespiratory fitness were associated with increased odds of adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (adjusted odds ratio [OR] per unit decrease 3.0 [95% CI 1.6-5.6]) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (1.7 [1.1-2.6]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A decline in fitness level between childhood and adulthood was associated with increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (4.5 [2.6-7.7]) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (2.1 [1.5-2.9]) per unit decline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A decline in fitness from childhood to adulthood, and by inference a decline in physical activity, is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Programs aimed at maintaining high childhood physical activity levels into adulthood may have potential for reducing the burden of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in adults </plain></SENT>
