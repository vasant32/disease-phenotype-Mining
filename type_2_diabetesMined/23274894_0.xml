<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have linked polymorphisms in G6PC2 with variations in FBG and body fat, although not insulin sensitivity or <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>G6PC2 encodes an islet-specific, endoplasmic reticulum-resident <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A combination of in situ perfused pancreas, in vitro isolated islet, and in vivo analyses were used to explore the function of G6pc2 in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>G6pc2 deletion had little effect on insulin sensitivity and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, whereas body fat was reduced in female G6pc2 knockout (KO) mice on both a chow and high-fat diet, observations that are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> consistent with human GWAS data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>G6pc2 deletion resulted in a leftward shift in the dose-response curve for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As a consequence, under fasting conditions in which plasma insulin levels were identical, blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were reduced in G6pc2 KO mice, again consistent with human GWAS data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi>-6-phosphatase activity was reduced, whereas basal cytoplasmic calcium levels were elevated in islets isolated from G6pc2 KO mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that G6pc2 represents a novel, negative regulator of basal GSIS that acts by hydrolyzing <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-6-phosphate, thereby reducing glycolytic flux </plain></SENT>
