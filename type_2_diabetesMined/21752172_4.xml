<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>None of the currently-available T2DM therapies is able to change the course of the disease by halting the relentless decline in pancreatic islet cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitors, or incretin enhancers, have been introduced in the treatment of T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This class of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering agents enhances endogenous glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> 1 (GLP-1) and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent insulinotropic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (GIP) levels by blocking the incretin-degrading enzyme DPP-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DPP-4 inhibitors may restore the deranged islet-cell balance in T2DM, by stimulating meal-related insulin secretion and by decreasing postprandial glucagon levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in rodent studies, DPP-4 inhibitors demonstrated beneficial effects on (functional) β-cell mass and pancreatic insulin content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Studies in humans with T2DM have indicated improvement of islet-cell function, both in the fasted state and under postprandial conditions and these beneficial effects were sustained in studies with a duration up to 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, there is at present no evidence in humans to suggest that DPP-4 inhibitors have durable effects on β-cell function after cessation of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Long-term, large-sized trials using an active blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> lowering comparator followed by a sufficiently long washout period after discontinuation of the study drug are needed to assess whether DPP-4 inhibitors may durably preserve pancreatic islet-cell function in patients with T2DM </plain></SENT>
