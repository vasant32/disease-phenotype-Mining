<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been demonstrated that mouse satellite cells behave as multipotent stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the differentiation capacities of human satellite cells and evaluated the effect of the insulin sensitiser <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>, a well known peroxisome proliferative activated receptor gamma (PPARG) <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, on their adipogenic conversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS, MATERIALS AND METHODS: We obtained human satellite cells from human muscle biopsies of healthy subjects by single-fibre isolation and cultured them under myogenic, osteogenic and adipogenic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we compared the morphological features and the adipose-specific gene expression profiling, as assessed by quantitative PCR, between adipocytes differentiated from human satellite cells and those obtained from the stromal vascular fraction of human visceral fat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We proved by morphological analysis, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression and immunohistochemistry that human satellite cells are able to differentiate into myotubes, adipocytes and osteocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> to the adipogenic medium strongly activated PPARG expression and enhanced adipogenesis in human satellite cells, but did not in itself trigger the complete adipogenic programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we observed a decrease in wingless-type MMTV integration site family member 10B and an upregulation of growth differentiation factor 8 expression, both being independent of PPARG activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Human satellite cells possess a clear adipogenic potential that could explain the presence of mature adipocytes within skeletal muscle in pathological conditions such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and ageing-related sarcopenia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">Rosiglitazone</z:chebi> treatment, while enhancing adipogenesis, induces a more favourable pattern of adipocytokine expression in satellite-derived fat cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This could partially counteract the worsening effect of intermuscular adipose tissue depots on muscle insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
