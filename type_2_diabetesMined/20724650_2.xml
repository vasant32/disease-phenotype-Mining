<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 3,182 diabetic subjects (aged 20-80 years) were recruited from 15 community health centers in Beijing using a multistage random sampling approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that the area under the curve for neck circumference and central <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> was 0.77 for men and 0.75 for women (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a neck circumference of ≥38 cm for men and ≥35 cm for women was the best cutoff point for determining overweight subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A neck circumference of ≥39 cm for men and ≥35 cm for women was the best cutoff point to determine subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, neck circumference is positively related with BMI, waist circumference, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> in Chinese individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
