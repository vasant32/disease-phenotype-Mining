<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In some population, SUMO4, a regulator of NF-ÎºB, gene polymorphism is associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A single-nucleotide polymorphism was detected in SUMO4; substituting a highly conserved methionine with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32861">valine residue</z:chebi> (M55V) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied the association between M55V polymorphism in the SUMO4 gene insusceptibility of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants were 50 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 50 control Iranian subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genotyping was done using polymorphism chain reaction (PCR) technique and subsequent cleavage by restriction endonuclease (RFLP) for the M55V SUMO4 gene variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequency of SUMO4 AA, AG and GG were 13%, 25% and 12% in control group and 20%, 22%, 18% in the type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The SUMO4 M55V variant was not associated with the susceptibility of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The study indicates that the SUMO4 gene M55V variant was not associated with the susceptibility of the type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> polymorphism </plain></SENT>
