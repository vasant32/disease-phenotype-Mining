<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesised that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> would activate the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway and increase the expression of genes involved in adiponectin signalling, NEFA oxidation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> function in human skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A randomised, double-blind, parallel study was performed in 26 drug-naive type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients treated with: (1) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (n = 14) or (2) aggressive nutritional therapy (n = 12) to reduce HbA(1c) to levels observed in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Participants were assigned randomly to treatment using a table of random numbers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Before and after 6 months, patients reported to the Clinical Research Center of the Texas <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Institute for a vastus lateralis muscle biopsy followed by a 180 min euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic (80 mU m(-2) min(-1)) clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (n = 14) or nutritional therapy (n = 12) group were included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">Pioglitazone</z:chebi> significantly increased plasma adiponectin concentration by 79% and reduced fasting plasma NEFA by 35% (both p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Following <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>, insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal increased by 30% (p &lt; 0.01), and muscle AMPK and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15351">acetyl-CoA</z:chebi> carboxylase (ACC) phosphorylation increased by 38% and 53%, respectively (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">Pioglitazone</z:chebi> increased <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels for adiponectin receptor 1 and 2 genes (ADIPOR1, ADIPOR2), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, coactivator 1 gene (PPARGC1) and multiple genes involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> function and fat oxidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Despite a similar reduction in HbA(1c) and similar improvement in insulin sensitivity with nutritional therapy, there were no significant changes in muscle AMPK and ACC phosphorylation, or the expression of ADIPOR1, ADIPOR2, PPARGC1 and genes involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> function and fat oxidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No adverse (or unexpected) effects or side effects were reported from the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">Pioglitazone</z:chebi> increases plasma adiponectin levels, stimulates muscle AMPK signalling and increases the expression of genes involved in adiponectin signalling, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> function and fat oxidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These changes may represent an important cellular mechanism by which <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> improve skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
