<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Improved clinical management of T2DM and improved glycaemic control with traditional therapies including insulin usually result in some <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> - a frequently perceived barrier to the introduction of insulin by both patient and healthcare professionals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>Weight gain</z:mp> of 2.5 kg per 1% change in <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c) (HbA(1c)) is common in many studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Strategies to minimize <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>, particularly in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients, are essential to help patients better manage their <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and improve quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Insulin analogues with lower risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> and better within-patient variability compared with human insulin may help facilitate reaching treatment goals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> can be minimized by earlier insulinization and the use of basal insulin, such as insulin glargine, instead of premixed insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data specific to the <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patient with T2DM are presented; they are currently limited but do indicate that insulin glargine therapy is associated with improved glycaemic control as well as less <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> than other insulins, such as premixed insulin and prandial insulin regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Retrospective subanalyses of earlier trials and ongoing studies would shed further light on the impact of insulin therapy in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> people with T2DM in addition to determination of optimal therapeutic strategies </plain></SENT>
