<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore evaluated the prevalence of CHD and conventional risk factors in 744 consecutive African (A, n=448) and White European (W, n=296) subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CHD was present in 4% of A and in 23% of W (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared with W, the A groups had lower total cholesterol (TC) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> (TG) levels: men: TC-W, 5.76 (S.D., 1.36) and A, 4.98 (1.29)mmol/l; TG-W, 2.10 (IQR,1.40-3.00) and A, 1.60 (1.10-2.55)mmol/l; women: TC-W, 5.85 (1.31) and A, 5.20 (1.24); TG-2.00 (1.40-2.90) and A, 1.40 (1.00-2.03)mmol/l (p&lt; or =0.0022 for each comparison) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The A had significantly lower TG:<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> ratios (an index of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>) (p=0.004) and were less likely to have (estimated) small dense <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> particles (p&lt; or =0.038) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In subjects with established CHD traditional risk factors were similar in A and W </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Regression analysis revealed that CHD associated in A with serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> (p=0.0015) and TC (p=0.038) and with TG in W (p=0.0072) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the rarity of CHD in diabetic Africans can be explained by contributions of low TC levels and probably lesser <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and its consequences; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal disease</z:e> may be an important additional risk factor </plain></SENT>
