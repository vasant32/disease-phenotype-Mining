<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE To study the overall effect of the Active Prevention in High-Risk Individuals of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Type 2 in and Around Eindhoven (APHRODITE) lifestyle intervention on type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk reduction in Dutch primary care after 0.5 and 1.5 years and to evaluate the variability between general practices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Individuals at high risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (Finnish <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Risk Score â‰¥13) were randomly assigned into an intervention group (n = 479) or a usual-care group (n = 446) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Comparisons were made between study groups and between general practices regarding changes in clinical and lifestyle measures over 1.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Participant, general practitioner, and nurse practitioner characteristics were compared between individuals who lost weight or maintained a stable weight and individuals who gained weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS Both groups showed modest changes in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> values, weight measures, physical activity, energy intake, and fiber intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Differences between groups were significant only for total physical activity, saturated fat intake, and fiber intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Differences between general practices were significant for BMI and 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> but not for energy intake and physical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the intervention group, the nurse practitioners' mean years of work experience was significantly longer in individuals who were successful at losing weight or maintaining a stable weight compared with unsuccessful individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, successful individuals more often had a partner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS Risk factors for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> could be significantly reduced by lifestyle counseling in Dutch primary care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The small differences in changes over time between the two study groups suggest that additional intervention effects are modest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In particular, the level of experience of the nurse practitioner and the availability of partner support seem to facilitate intervention success </plain></SENT>
