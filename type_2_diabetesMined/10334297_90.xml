<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Islet amyloid has been recognized as a pathological entity in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> since the turn of the century </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has as its unique component the islet beta-cell <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (IAPP), or amylin, which is cosecreted with insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition to this unique component, islet amyloid contains other proteins, such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24500">heparan</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycan</z:chebi> perlecan, which are typically observed in other forms of generalized and localized amyloid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Islet amyloid is observed at pathological examination in the vast majority of individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> but is rarely observed in humans without disturbances of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast to IAPP from rodents, human IAPP has been shown to form amyloid fibrils in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> human subjects produce and secrete the amyloidogenic form of IAPP, yet not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> develop islet amyloid, some other factor(s) must be involved in islet amyloid formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One hypothesis is that an alteration in beta-cell function resulting in a change in the production, processing, and/or secretion of IAPP is critical to the initial formation of islet amyloid fibrils in human <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This nidus of amyloid fibrils then allows the progressive accumulation of IAPP-containing fibrils and the eventual replacement of beta-cell mass by amyloid and contributes to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One factor that may be involved in producing the changes in the beta-cell that result in the initiation of amyloid formation is the consumption of increased dietary fat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Dietary fat is known to alter islet beta-cell <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> production, processing, and secretion, and studies in transgenic mice expressing human IAPP support the operation of this mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further investigation using this and other models should provide insight into the mechanism(s) involved in islet amyloidogenesis and allow the development of therapeutic agents that inhibit or reverse amyloid fibril formation, with the goal being to preserve beta-cell function and improve <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
