<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Several studies have shown a bimodal curve in the distribution of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in populations with a high prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but bimodality has not been reported among whites of Northern European ancestry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is not clear whether this difference reflects the lower prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, obscuring a second mode, or implies a more fundamental difference between whites and nonwhites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigate this issue by studying <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> distributions in older white patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A study of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was conducted among older community-dwelling white residents of a suburban Southern California community between 1984 and 1987 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two-hour plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> data were collected from 2,326 older white men and women aged 23-92 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To investigate bimodality of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> distributions, we fit unimodal and bimodal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> models to 2-h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations transformed by the Box-Cox family of transformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that the bimodal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mixture model fit the data significantly better than the unimodal skewed distribution model for both sexes and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> age-groups except those &gt; or =80 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cut points separating the two modes were generally within the 11.1- to 13.6-mmol/l range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The bimodality of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> distributions among whites, combined with previous findings, indicates that this phenomenon may be universal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A smaller second mode in our study compared with other studies suggests that whites have <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility but may require more <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> to demonstrate it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>With increasing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in the U.S., the predicted epidemic of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may affect <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ethnic groups including whites </plain></SENT>
