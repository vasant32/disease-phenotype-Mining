<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the levels of ET-1 and the effect of postmenopausal hormonal therapy on ET-1 levels in postmenopausal women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We compared plasma levels of ET-1 in 22 postmenopausal type 2 diabetic women and 14 postmenopausal women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> with plasma levels in 10 healthy postmenopausal control women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The basal values for ET-1 were measured for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These women were then randomised to receive in a double-dummy, crossover trial: either oral continuous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23965">oestradiol</z:chebi> (2.0 mg) + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7627">norethisterone</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> (1.0 mg) per day or continuous transdermal <z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">oestrogen</z:chebi>-only (50 mg/day) for 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Between the active therapy there were 3-month wash-out periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ET-1-values were measured again at the end of each treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The type 2 diabetic women had significantly (p &lt; 0.003) elevated ET-1 levels (4.8+/-1.0 pg/ml) whereas those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> (4.4+/-1.7 pg/ml]) had non-significantly (NS) elevated ET-1 levels compared to controls (3.6+/-0.3 pg/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both oral and transdermal hormone replacement therapy (HRT) failed to affect plasma ET-1 except in 14 hypertensive women from the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> groups who were on angiotensin convertase enzyme (ACE) inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These women's ET-1 levels before oral HRT (4.6+/-1.1 pg/ml) fell to 4.1+/-0.9 pg/ml (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in postmenopausal women is associated with elevated ET-1 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">Oestrogen</z:chebi> replacement therapy does not affect the levels of ET-1 in postmenopausal women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
