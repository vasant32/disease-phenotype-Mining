<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in a Chinese population with the aim of identifying novel variants for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Asians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis of three GWAS comprising 684 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 955 controls of Southern Han Chinese descent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We followed up the top signals in two independent Southern Han Chinese cohorts (totalling 10,383 cases and 6,974 controls), and performed in silico replication in multiple populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified CDKN2A/B and four novel type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> association signals with p &lt; 1 × 10(-5) from the meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirteen variants within these four loci were followed up in two independent Chinese cohorts, and rs10229583 at 7q32 was found to be associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a combined analysis of 11,067 cases and 7,929 controls (p meta = 2.6 × 10(-8); OR [95% CI] 1.18 [1.11, 1.25]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In silico replication revealed consistent associations across multiethnic groups, including five East Asian populations (p meta = 2.3 × 10(-10)) and a population of European descent (p = 8.6 × 10(-3)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rs10229583 risk variant was associated with elevated fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, impaired beta cell function in controls, and an earlier age at diagnosis for the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The novel variant lies within an islet-selective cluster of open regulatory elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of effect between Han Chinese and individuals of European descent, Malaysians and Indians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our study identifies rs10229583 near PAX4 as a novel locus for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Chinese and other populations and provides new insights into the pathogenesis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
