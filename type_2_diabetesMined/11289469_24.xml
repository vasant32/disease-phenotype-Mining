<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Whereas new diagnostic criteria based on a fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) of &gt; 126 mg/dl (7.8 mmol/l) have improved the detection of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, multiple reports indicate that many people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosed by 2-h oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> measurements &gt; or = 11.1 mmol/l (200 mg/dl) would remain undiagnosed based on this FPG criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, improved methods to detect <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are particularly needed for high-risk individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated whether the combination of FPG and HbA1c measurements enhanced detection of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in those individuals at risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with nondiagnostic or minimally elevated FPG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed FPG, OGTT, and HbA1c data from 244 subjects screened for participation in the Early <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Intervention Program (EDIP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 244 high-risk subjects studied by FPG measurements and OGTT, 24% of the individuals with FPG levels of 5.5-6.0 mmol/l (100-109 mg/dl) had OGTT-diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and nearly 50% of the individuals with FPG levels of 6.1-6.9 mmol/l (110-125 mg/dl) had OGTT-diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the subjects with OGTT-diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and FPG levels between 5.5 and 8.0 mmol/l, detection of an elevated HbA1c (&gt;6.1% or mean + 2 SDs) led to a substantial improvement in diagnostic sensitivity over the FPG threshold of 7.0 mmol/l (61 vs. 45%, respectively, P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Concordant FPG levels &gt; or = 7.0 mmol/l (currently recommended for diagnosis) occurred in only 19% of our cohort with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Diagnostic criteria based on FPG criteria are relatively insensitive in the detection of early type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in at-risk subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HbA1c measurement improves the sensitivity of screening in high-risk individuals </plain></SENT>
