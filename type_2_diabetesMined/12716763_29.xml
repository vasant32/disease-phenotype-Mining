<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To evaluate whether eNOS gene variants are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we evaluated polymorphisms in Exon7 (E298D), intron 18 (IVS18 + 27A--&gt;C), and intron 23 (IVS23 + 10G--&gt;T) in 159 type 2 diabetic patients without macrovascular complications and in 207 healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Samples for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> hormonal and metabolic variables were obtained after an overnight fast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The D298 and IVS18 + 27C alleles, but not the IVS23 + 10G--&gt;T variant, were significantly more frequent in type 2 diabetic patients than in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The two- and three-loci haplotype analysis showed that there is a statistically significant association between the eNOS variants and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were observed in the clinical characteristics of type 2 diabetic patients according to genotypes (except for visceral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> [waist-to-hip ratio], which was significantly more present in D298 homozygotes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Healthy control subjects homozygous for both D298 and IVS18 + 27C presented higher insulin, C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, and nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> levels, as well as higher HOMA (homeostasis model assessment) values than the double <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> homozygotes, with values superimposable on those found in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we described a significant association between eNOS gene polymorphisms and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, suggesting a new genetic susceptibility factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
