<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the Australian protocol for identifying undiagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The Australian screening protocol recommends a stepped approach to detecting undiagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> based on assessment of risk status, measurement of fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) in individuals at risk, and further testing according to FPG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The performance of and variations to this protocol were assessed in a population-based sample of 10,508 Australians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The protocol had a sensitivity of 79.9%, specificity of 79.9%, and a positive predictive value (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>) of 13.7% for detecting undiagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and sensitivity of 51.9% and specificity of 86.7% for detecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) or impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (IFG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To achieve these diagnostic rates, 20.7% of the Australian adult population would require an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increasing the FPG cut point to 6.1 mmol/l (110 mg/dl) or using HbA(1c) instead of FPG to determine the need for an OGTT in people with risk factors reduced sensitivity, increased specificity and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>, and reduced the proportion requiring an OGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, each of these protocol variations substantially reduced the detection of IGT or IFG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The Australian screening protocol identified one new case of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for every 32 people screened, with 4 of 10 people screened requiring FPG measurement and 1 in 5 requiring an OGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, 1 in 11 people screened had IGT or IFG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Including HbA(1c) measurement substantially reduced both the number requiring an OGTT and the detection of IGT or IFG </plain></SENT>
