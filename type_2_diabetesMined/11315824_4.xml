<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The relationships between age at diagnosis and parental history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> as well as an array of clinical and metabolic factors were examined using a hospital clinic-based <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> registry involving 3,414 index patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> Patterns of age at diagnosis in successive generations were also examined using 21 affected child-parent pairs and 7 affected child-parent-grandparent trios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Approximately 29% of the index patients were diagnosed with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at &lt; or = 35 years of age (hereby defined as early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared with the patients diagnosed at &gt;35 years of age (hereby defined as <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo>) the early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> patients had higher rates of positive paternal (16 vs. 5%) and maternal (22 vs. 12%) history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (both at P &lt; 0.01) and had poorer metabolic profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the overall index patients, male sex, higher HbA1c waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and systolic blood pressure (sBP); lower <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> level; and a positive paternal was well as maternal history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> predicted younger age at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>More senior age and higher BMI and diastolic blood pressure predicted olderq age at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Predictors for younger age at diagnosis in the male patients were higher HbA1c and sBP and a positive paternal history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> Predictors for younger age at diagnosis in the female patients were higher HbA1c WHR, and sBP and a paternal as well as maternal history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the affected child parent pairs and clild-parent-grandparent trios there was a decrease in age at diagnosis in successive generations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that both familial (possibly genetic) and metabolic factors affect the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the Chinese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results also suggest an <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and progression pattern of the disease that is compatible with the phenomenon of anticipation </plain></SENT>
