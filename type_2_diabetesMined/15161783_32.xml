<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present dose-ranging study was to assess the efficacy and safety of ragaglitazar in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This study included 177 hypertriglyceridemic type 2 diabetic subjects who participated in a 12-week, double-blind, parallel, randomized, placebo-controlled dose-ranging study (open <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> arm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects received ragaglitazar (0.1, 1, 4, or 10 mg), placebo, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (45 mg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Efficacy parameters included fasting plasma levels of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) along with other <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels, A1C, and insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ragaglitazar in doses of 1, 4, and 10 mg resulted in a significant decrease from baseline as compared with placebo in FPG (-48, -74, -77 mg/dl) and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (-40, -62, -51%), free fatty acids (-36, -54, -62%), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B (-13, -29, -25%), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (-14 and -19% for 4- and 10-mg groups), and total cholesterol (-16 and -15% for 4 and 10 mg) and a significant increase in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (20 and 31% for 1- and 4-mg groups, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Changes in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> and FPG for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> treatment were similar to 1 mg ragaglitazar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean A1C values of the 1-, 4-, and 10-mg ragaglitazar and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> groups were significantly reduced compared with placebo (-0.5, -1.3, -1.1, and -0.3%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Common adverse events were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, weight increase, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>leukopenia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Ragaglitazar provided glycemic control that was comparable with that of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> and, compared with placebo, provided significant improvement in the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile </plain></SENT>
