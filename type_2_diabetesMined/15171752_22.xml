<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies suggest that early treatment with TZDs may prevent the progression from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (IR) to type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This prospective analysis examined the effect of early TZD treatment in the prevention or delay of T2DM in a multiethnic population with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) and IR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The analysis included 172 patients (aged 29-86 years) with IGT and IR (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or borderline HbA(1c), C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels &gt; 2 mg/ml, fasting blood sugar 100-125 mg/dl, and 2-h postprandial blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels 140-200 mg/dl) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients in the active treatment group (n = 101) had received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> for an average of 10 months before being randomly switched to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> (4 mg/day) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (30 mg/day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were switched when <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> was withdrawn from the US market because of liver toxicity concerns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with IGT and IR who received no <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> medication served as a control group (n = 71) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HbA(1c) and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels were measured at baseline (2 years) and study end point (3 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier testing, using time to outcome as the main outcome variable, determined risk reduction in the TZD group relative to the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean HbA(1c) and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels decreased for patients receiving either TZD at the 2-year assessment, and reductions were maintained at study end point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After 2 years, none of the patients receiving TZD therapy progressed to T2DM; three patients progressed to T2DM by study end point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the control group, 11 patients became diabetic after 2 years and 19 patients became diabetic by the end of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The incidence (risk reduction) of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after 3 years was 88.9% lower in the TZD group compared with the control group (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The TZDs, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>, were effective in reducing HbA(1c) and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels in patients with IGT/IR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Progression of IR/IGT to T2DM appears to be significantly delayed or prevented with early TZD treatment </plain></SENT>
