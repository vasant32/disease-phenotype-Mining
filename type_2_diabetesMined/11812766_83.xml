<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent genome-wide scans have mapped a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility locus to chromosome 3q27, where the adiponectin gene (APM1) is located </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Herein, we present evidence of an association between frequent single nucleotide polymorphisms at positions 45 and 276 in the adiponectin gene and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P = 0.003 and P = 0.002, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects with the G/G genotype at position 45 or the G/G genotype at position 276 had a significantly increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (odds ratio 1.70 [95% CI 1.09-2.65] and 2.16 [1.22-3.95], respectively) compared with those having the T/T genotype at positions 45 and 276, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, the subjects with the G/G genotype at position 276 had a higher <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> index than those with the T/T genotype (1.61 +/- 0.05 vs. 1.19 +/- 0.12, P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The G allele at position 276 was linearly associated with lower plasma adiponectin levels (G/G: 10.4 +/- 0.85 microg/ml, G/T: 13.7 +/- 0.87 microg/ml, T/T: 16.6 +/- 2.24 microg/ml, P = 0.01) in subjects with higher BMIs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on these findings together with the observation that adiponectin improves insulin sensitivity in animal models, we conclude that the adiponectin gene may be a susceptibility gene for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
