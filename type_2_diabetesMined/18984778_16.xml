<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study of 14,006 men (7,795 for the analyses of IFG), who did not have an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>abnormal electrocardiogram</z:hpo> or a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027051" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MR|mi|AMI">heart attack</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, or <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the men, 3,612 (39,610 person-years) and 477 (101,419 person-years) developed IFG and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared with the least fit 20% in multivariate analyses, IFG and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risks in the most fit 20% were 14 and 52% lower, respectively (both P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Men with BMI &gt; or =30.0 kg/m2, waist girth &gt;102.0 cm, or percent body fat &gt; or =25 had 2.7-, 1.9-, and 1.3-fold higher risks for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, respectively, compared with those for nonobese men (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.01), and the results for IFG were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the combined analyses, <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> unfit (least fit 20%) men had a 5.7-fold higher risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-weight fit (most fit 80%) men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We observed similar trends for the joint associations of BMI and fitness with IFG and those of waist girth or percent body fat and fitness with both IFG and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Low fitness and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> increased the risks of IFG and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by approximately similar magnitudes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When considered simultaneously, fitness attenuated but did not eliminate the increased risks of IFG and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and the highest risk was found in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and unfit men </plain></SENT>
