<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Long-term administration of specific DP IV inhibitors, so as to enhance circulating active GIP and GLP-1 levels, has been shown to improve <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance and beta-cell <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> responsiveness and to reduce <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> in the Vancouver diabetic fatty (VDF) rat model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results provide the first demonstration of improved hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity after DP IV inhibitor therapy, and coupled with apparent improvements in beta-cell function, they offer strong support for the utility of these compounds in the treatment of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
