<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This extension study assessed long-term tolerability of linagliptin over 52 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Japanese patients with T2DM who completed either phase of a 12-week/26-week study comparing linagliptin monotherapy with placebo or voglibose were eligible to enrol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the extension study, the comparator groups switched to linagliptin 5 or 10 mg, while the linagliptin groups maintained dosage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 540 patients received at least one dose of linagliptin 5 or 10 mg and 494 completed the extension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Long-term treatment with linagliptin was well tolerated; adverse events (AEs) of special interest and serious AEs occurred in small percentages of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Drug-related AEs occurred in 10.2 and 10.6% of patients in the linagliptin 5- and 10-mg groups, respectively, and discontinuations due to drug-related AEs occurred in 1.1 and 0.7%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only one (0.4%) patient in each dose group experienced investigator-defined <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> during the treatment period (both events were non-severe) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Body weight was not clinically altered in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c profiles over time were similar with linagliptin 5 and 10 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide evidence for the safety and tolerability of oral linagliptin at either 5 or 10 mg for up to 52 weeks for the treatment of Japanese patients with T2DM, without clinically relevant increase in the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> or <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
