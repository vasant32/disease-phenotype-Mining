<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials comparing dietary or non-dietary intake of n-3 PUFA with placebo in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was conducted by systematically searching databases from 1966 to February 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Changes in C-reactive protein, IL-6, TNF-alpha, platelet function, fibrinogen, factor VII, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor, endothelial function, heart rate and blood pressure were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Inclusion of studies, data extraction and quality were assessed independently in duplicate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twelve trials involving 847 subjects with a mean treatment duration of 8.5 weeks included sufficient data to permit pooling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with placebo, n-3 PUFA supplementation had a significant effect on two outcomes: reducing the level of diastolic blood pressure (five trials, 248 subjects) by a mean of 1.8 mm Hg (95% CI 0.0-3.6, p = 0.05) and increasing factor VII (two trials, 116 subjects) by 24.9% (95% CI 7.2-42.6, p = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no significant effects on systolic blood pressure, fibrinogen or heart rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These results suggest that, in addition to the recognised effects on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidaemia</z:e>, n-3 PUFA decreases diastolic blood pressure, and appears to increase factor VII </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Larger and more rigorously conducted clinical trials are required to establish conclusively the role of n-3 PUFA in cardiovascular risk markers and clinical outcomes in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
