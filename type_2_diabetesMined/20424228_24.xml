<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Common variants in PPARG, KCNJ11, TCF7L2, SLC30A8, HHEX, CDKN2A, IGF2BP2, and CDKAL1 genes have been shown to be associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in European populations by genome-wide association studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have studied the association of common variants in these eight genes with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and related traits in Indians by combining the data from two independent case-control studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We genotyped eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (PPARG-rs1801282, KCNJ11-rs5219, TCF7L2-rs7903146, SLC30A8-rs13266634, HHEX-rs1111875, CDKN2A-rs10811661, IGF2BP2-rs4402960, and CDKAL1-rs10946398) in 5,164 unrelated Indians of Indo-European ethnicity, including 2,486 type 2 diabetic patients and 2,678 ethnically matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We confirmed the association of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eight loci with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with odds ratio (OR) ranging from 1.18 to 1.89 (P = 1.6 x 10(-3) to 4.6 x 10(-34)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The strongest association with the highest effect size was observed for TCF7L2 (OR 1.89 [95% CI 1.71-2.09], P = 4.6 x 10(-34)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also found significant association of PPARG and TCF7L2 with homeostasis model assessment of beta-cell function (P = 6.9 x 10(-8) and 3 x 10(-4), respectively), which looked consistent with recessive and under-dominant models, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study replicates the association of well-established common variants with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Indians and shows larger effect size for most of them than those reported in Europeans </plain></SENT>
