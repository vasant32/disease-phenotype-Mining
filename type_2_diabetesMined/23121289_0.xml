<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Outside of the biological arena the term 'repression' often has a negative connotation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in the pancreatic β-cell a small group of genes, which are abundantly expressed in most if not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other mammalian tissues, are highly selectively repressed, with likely functional consequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The two '<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e>' members of this group, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase A (Ldha) and monocarboxylate transporter-1 (MCT-1/Slc16a1), are inactivated by multiple mechanisms including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> modifications and microRNA-mediated silencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their inactivation ensures that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>, derived from muscle during exercise, do not stimulate insulin release inappropriately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Correspondingly, activating mutations in the MCT-1 promoter underlie 'exercise-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0002079'>hyperinsulinism</z:mp>' (EIHI) in man, a condition mimicked by forced over-expression of MCT-1 in the β-cell in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, LDHA expression in the β-cell is upregulated in both human type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519106" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">rodent models</z:e> of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recent work by us and by others has identified a further ∼60 genes which are selectively inactivated in the β-cell, a list which we refine here up to seven by detailed comparison of the two studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These genes include key regulators of cell proliferation and stimulus-secretion coupling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present, and our earlier results, thus highlight the probable importance of shutting down a subset of 'disallowed' genes for the differentiated function of β-cells, and implicate previously unsuspected signalling pathways in the control of β-cell expansion and insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Targeting of deregulated 'disallowed' genes in these cells may thus, in the future, provide new therapeutic avenues for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
