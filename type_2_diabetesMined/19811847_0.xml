<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a population-based study (n=1128 men) 17 men made replicate measurements to estimate ME at age 71 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Effect of 1 SD decrease of predictors M/I and EIR on longitudinal response variables fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) and HbA1c at follow-ups up to 11 years, were estimated using uncorrected and ME-corrected (with the regression calibration method) regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Uncorrected effect on FPG at age 77 years was larger for M/I than for EIR (effect difference 0.10mmol/l, 95% CI 0.00;0.21), while ME-corrected effects were similar (0.02mmol/l, 95% CI -0.13;0.15mmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EIR had greater ME-corrected impact than M/I on HbA1c at age 82 years (-0.11%, -0.28; -0.01%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Due to higher ME effect of EIR on glycaemia is underestimated as compared with M/I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By correcting for ME valid estimates of relative contributions of insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity on glycaemia are obtained </plain></SENT>
