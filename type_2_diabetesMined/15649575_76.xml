<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Male subjects with IGT recruited from health-screening examinees were randomly assigned in a 4:1 ratio to a standard intervention group (control group) and intensive intervention group (intervention group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The final numbers of subjects were 356 and 102, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The subjects in the control group and in the intervention group were advised to maintain body mass index (BMI) of &lt;24.0 kg/m2 and of &lt;22.0 kg/m2, respectively, by diet and exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the intervention group, detailed instructions on lifestyle were repeated every 3-4 months during hospital visits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> was judged to have developed when two or more consecutive fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) values exceeded 140 mg/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A 100g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test was performed every 6 months to detect improvement of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The subjects were seen in an ordinary outpatient clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cumulative 4-year incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 9.3% in the control group, versus 3.0% in the intervention group, and the reduction in risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 67.4% (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Body weight decreased by 0.39 kg in the control group and by 2.18 kg in the intervention group (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The control group was subclassified according to increase and decrease in body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was positively correlated with the changes in body weight, and the improvement in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance was negatively correlated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Subjects with higher FPG at baseline developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at a higher rate than those with lower FPG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Higher 2h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> values and higher BMI values at baseline were also associated with a higher incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but the differences were not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Subjects with a low insulinogenic index (DeltaIRI/DeltaPG 30 min after an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> load) developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at a significantly higher rate than those with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> insulinogenic index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the BMI data and incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in five <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention studies by lifestyle intervention revealed a linear correlation between the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the BMI values, with the exception of the DaQing Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However, the slope of the reduction in incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the intensive intervention groups was steeper than expected simply on the basis of the reduction of BMI, suggesting that the effect of lifestyle intervention cannot be solely ascribed to the body weight reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>We conclude that lifestyle intervention aimed at achieving ideal body weight in men with IGT is effective and can be conducted in an outpatient clinic setting </plain></SENT>
