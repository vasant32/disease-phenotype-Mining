<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To prospectively examine the magnitude and predictors of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-attributable non-blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering (non-BGL) medication costs in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Detailed data from 593 community-dwelling patients were available over 4.3 +/- 0.4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp>-attributable costs (in year 2000 Australian dollars [A$]) were calculated by applying a range of attributable proportions for each complication for which medication was prescribed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Non-BGL medications accounted for 75% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> prescription medication costs over the study period, and one-third were attributable to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median annual cost (in A$) of non-BGL medications per patient increased from A$220 to A$429 over 4 years (P &lt; 0.001), whereas the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-attributable contribution increased from A$31 (range 15-40) to A$159 (range 95-219) per patient (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp>-attributable hospital costs remained stable during the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp>-attributable non-BGL costs were skewed and, therefore, square root transformed before regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Independent baseline determinants of square root cost/year were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e>, systolic blood pressure, total serum cholesterol, ln(serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>), ln(albumin-to-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio), serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, education, and, negatively, male sex and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (P &lt;/= 0.043; R(2) = 29%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Projected to the Australian population, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-attributable non-BGL medication costs for patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> totaled A$79 million/year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The median annual cost of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-attributable non-BGL medications increased fivefold over 4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This increase was predicted by vascular risk factors and complications at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Better-educated patients had higher costs, probably reflecting improved health care access </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Men and patients with higher fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels had lower costs, suggesting barriers to health care and/or poor self-care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The contemporaneous containment of hospital costs may be due to the beneficial effect of increased medication use </plain></SENT>
