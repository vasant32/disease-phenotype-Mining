<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> 1 (GLP-1) is an insulinotropic gut hormone that, when given exogenously, may be a useful agent in the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a 3-month trial to determine the efficacy and safety of GLP-1 in elderly diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 16 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were being treated with oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi> were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight patients (aged 75 +/- 2 years, BMI 27 +/- 1 kg/m(2)) remained on usual <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering therapy and eight patients (aged 73 +/- 1 years, BMI 27 +/- 1 kg/m(2)), after discontinuing hypoglycemic medications, received GLP-1 delivered by continuous subcutaneous infusion for 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The maximum dose was 120 pmol x kg(-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>h(-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients recorded their capillary blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (CBG) levels (four times per day, 3 days per week) and whenever they perceived hypoglycemic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The primary end points were HbA(1c) and CBG determinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additionally, changes in beta-cell sensitivity to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, peripheral tissue sensitivity to insulin, and changes in plasma ghrelin levels were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HbA(1c) levels (7.1%) and body weight were equally maintained in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The usual treatment group had a total of 87 CBG measurements of &lt;or=3.6 mmol/l during the study, and only 1 such measurement (3.5 mmol/l) was recorded in the GLP-1 group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Infusion of GLP-1 enhanced <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced insulin secretion (pre: 119 +/- 21; post: 202 +/- 51 pmol/l; P &lt; 0.05) and insulin-mediated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal (pre: 29.8 +/- 3.3; post: 35.9 +/- 2.3 micromol x kg(-1 x min(-1); P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No effect of GLP-1 treatment was seen on the fasting plasma ghrelin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although plasma ghrelin levels decreased during both portions of the clamp, a drug effect was not present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A GLP-1 compound is a promising therapeutic option for elderly diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
