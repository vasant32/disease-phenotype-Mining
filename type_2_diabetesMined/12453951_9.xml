<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the metabolic effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of nateglinide in subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT) and to identify a dose appropriate for use in a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, fixed-dose study of 8 weeks' duration was performed in a total of 288 subjects with IGT using a 2:2:2:1 randomization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects received nateglinide (30, 60, and 120 mg) or placebo before each main meal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Metabolic effectiveness was assessed during a standardized meal challenge performed before and after the 8-week treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> adverse events (AEs) were recorded, and confirmed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> was defined as symptoms accompanied by a self-monitoring of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> measurement &lt; or =3.3 mmol/l (plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &lt; or =3.7 mmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nateglinide elicited a dose-related increase of insulin and a decrease of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> during standardized meal challenges, with the predominant effect on early insulin release, leading to a substantial reduction in peak plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nateglinide was well tolerated, and symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> were the only treatment-emergent AEs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Confirmed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> occurred in 28 subjects receiving nateglinide (30 mg, 0 [0%]; 60 mg, 5 [6.6%]; 120 mg, 23 [26.7%]) and in 1 (2.3%) subject receiving placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Nateglinide was safe and effective in reducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011998'>postprandial hyperglycemia</z:hpo> in subjects with IGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Preprandial doses of 30 or 60 mg nateglinide would be appropriate to use for longer-term studies to determine whether a rapid-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, rapidly reversible, insulinotropic agent can delay or prevent the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
