<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We identified tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3 (TIMP3), the endogenous inhibitor of A disintegrin and metalloprotease domain 17 (ADAM17) and other matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), as a gene modifier for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001863'>vascular inflammation</z:mp> in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We tested its association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and identified Sirtuin 1 (SirT1) as a major regulator of TIMP3 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We investigated ADAM10, ADAM17, MMP9, TIMP1, TIMP2, TIMP3, and TIMP4 expression levels in human carotid atherosclerotic plaques (n = 60) from subjects with and without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Human vascular smooth muscle cells exposed to several metabolic stimuli were used to identify regulators of TIMP3 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SirT1 small interference <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>, cDNA, and TIMP3 promoter gene reporter were used to study SirT1-dependent regulation of TIMP3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Here, we show that in human carotid atherosclerotic plaques, TIMP3 was significantly reduced in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, leading to ADAM17 and MMP9 overactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reduced expression of TIMP3 was associated in vivo with SirT1 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In smooth muscle cells, inhibition of SirT1 activity and levels reduced TIMP3 expression, whereas SirT1 overexpression increased TIMP3 promoter activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In atherosclerotic plaques from subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the deregulation of ADAM17 and MMP9 activities is related to inadequate expression of TIMP3 via SirT1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Studies in vascular cells confirmed the role of SirT1 in tuning TIMP3 expression </plain></SENT>
