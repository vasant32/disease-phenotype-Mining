<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this study we developed and evaluated the psychometric properties of the Satisfaction with Oral Anti-Diabetic Agent Scale (SOADAS), the first treatment satisfaction instrument specific to oral anti-diabetic agents (OADs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three focus groups and three rounds of cognitive debriefing interviews with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients using OADs informed the development of the six-item SOADAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The measurement properties of the SOADAS were evaluated in a US cross-sectional study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients completed the SOADAS, Treatment Satisfaction for Medication Questionnaire (TSQM), the Short Form-12 (SF-12) Health Survey and a demographic questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first half of the recruited patient population was asked to return at 7 days follow-up to complete the SOADAS again </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An exploratory factor analysis on the SOADAS yielded a one-factor solution, indicating that the SOADAS was uni-dimensional </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The SOADAS had high internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha=0.86) and acceptable test-retest reliability (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e>=0.79) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was correlated most highly with the TSQM (r=0.71, p&lt;0.001) and least with the mental summary component score of the SF-12 (r=0.24, p=0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean SOADAS scores were approximately two points higher for participants with lower HbA(1c) values (&lt;7%) versus those with higher values, and for participants without versus with selected symptoms (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The findings from this study suggest that the SOADAS is a valid and reliable measure of patient satisfaction with oral anti-diabetic medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This questionnaire may be useful for assessing outcomes in future clinical studies of oral anti-diabetic medications </plain></SENT>
