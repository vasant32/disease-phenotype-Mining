<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We performed a double blind randomised controlled trial in general practice to assess equivalence between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27999">tolbutamide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> with respect to the effect on mean HbA(1c) in newly diagnosed patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Secondary objectives were to compare the effects of both treatments on fasting and post-load blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin levels, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, and adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomised to receive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi>, titrated step-wise to a maximum of 100mg three times daily (n=48) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27999">tolbutamide</z:chebi>, similarly titrated to a maximum of 2000 mg in three doses (n=48) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The two treatments were considered equivalent if the two-sided 90% confidence interval (CI) for the difference in mean HbA(1c) levels was within the range -0.4 to 0.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results were analysed on an intention-to-treat, per-protocol and on worst-case basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both agents reduced the HbA(1c) percentage and fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The difference in mean decrease of HbA(1c) was 0.6% in favour of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27999">tolbutamide</z:chebi> (90% CI 0.3, 0.9; 95% CI 0.2, 1.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A worst-case analysis, assuming no change in HbA(1c) for dropouts, yielded a difference in mean decrease of 0.9% (90% CI 0.6, 1.2) in favour of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27999">tolbutamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The difference in mean decrease of fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was 1.0 mmol/l in favour of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27999">tolbutamide</z:chebi> (95% CI 0.3, 1.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in post-load blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, fasting and post-load insulin levels, or <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> group significantly more patients (15 versus 3) discontinued therapy because of adverse effects, mostly of gastrointestinal origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the results of this study favour <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27999">tolbutamide</z:chebi> over <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> as first treatment for patients with newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
