<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used repeated measurements to characterize IL-1Ra trajectories in individuals who developed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This case-cohort study, nested within the Whitehall II cohort, was based on 335 incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> cases and 2,475 noncases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We measured serum IL-1Ra levels at up to three time points per individual and estimated retrospective trajectories of IL-1Ra before <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosis (case subjects) or end of follow-up (control subjects) using multilevel analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Models were adjusted for age, sex, and ethnicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IL-1Ra levels were already higher in the case than control subjects 13 years before <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosis/end of follow-up (mean [95% CI] 302 [290-314] vs. 244 [238-249] pg/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In control subjects, IL-1Ra levels showed a modest linear increase throughout the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In case subjects, IL-1Ra trajectories were parallel to those in control subjects until 6 years (95% CI 7.5-4.5) before diagnosis and then rose steeply to 399 (379-420) pg/ml at the time of diagnosis (P &lt; 0.0001 for slope difference) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adjustment for BMI and waist circumference as time-varying covariates had little impact on these trajectories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We show elevated IL-1Ra levels for 13 years and an accelerated increase during the last 6 years before type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosis, indicating the presence of an anti-<z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> that may act to counterbalance the metabolic and immunologic disturbances that precede type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
