<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied whether preterm birth carries a similar risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The Helsinki Birth Cohort includes 13,345 men and women born between 1934 and 1944 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of them, 12,813 had adequate data on length of gestation, which we linked with data on special reimbursement for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the subjects, 5.1% had received special reimbursement after age 40 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In subjects born before 35 weeks of gestation, the odds ratio for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 1.68 (95% CI 1.06-2.65) compared with that in those born at term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for birth weight relative to length of gestation, the odds ratio was 1.59 (1.00-2.52) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Preterm birth before 35 weeks of gestation is associated with an increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in adult life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The risk is independent of that associated with slow fetal growth </plain></SENT>
