<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The top signals observed in this meta-analysis were followed up in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Genetics Replication and Meta-analysis Consortium (DIAGRAM) and DIAGRAM+ datasets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analysed 967 cases and 343 normoglycaemic controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The samples were genotyped with the Affymetrix Genome-wide Human SNP array 5.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Associations of genotyped and imputed markers with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were tested using a missing data likelihood score test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A fixed-effects meta-analysis including 1,804 cases and 780 normoglycaemic controls was carried out by weighting the effect estimates by their inverse variances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the meta-analysis of the two Hispanic studies, markers showing suggestive associations (p &lt; 10(-5)) were identified in two known <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> genes, HNF1A and KCNQ1, as well as in several additional regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Meta-analysis of the two Hispanic studies and the recent DIAGRAM+ dataset identified genome-wide significant signals (p &lt; 5 × 10(-8)) within or near the genes HNF1A and CDKN2A/CDKN2B, as well as suggestive associations in three additional regions, IGF2BP2, KCNQ1 and the previously unreported C14orf70 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We observed numerous regions with suggestive associations with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Some of these signals correspond to regions described in previous studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, many of these regions could not be replicated in the DIAGRAM datasets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is critical to carry out additional studies in Hispanic and American Indian populations, which have a high prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
