<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Both <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and a family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> reduce insulin sensitivity, but the impact of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> on insulin secretion among individuals predisposed to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used a pedigree-based approach to test the hypothesis that beta-cell compensation to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> is defective among individuals predisposed to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by virtue of a strong family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> before the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 126 members of 26 families ascertained for at least a sib pair with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> before age 65 years underwent a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27999">tolbutamide</z:chebi>-modified frequently sampled intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (FSIGT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Family members included 26 individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> and 100 individuals with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (NGT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (AIRglucose) was determined and insulin sensitivity (S(I)) estimated by minimal model analysis of FSIGT data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The beta-cell compensation for insulin sensitivity was estimated from the disposition index (DI), calculated as the product of S(I) and AIRglucose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> was measured by BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> individuals, BMI was a significant predictor of both S(I) and AIRglucose, as expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, BMI also significantly predicted DI (P = 0.002) after correcting for age, sex, family membership, and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The relationship of BMI and DI was confirmed in 85 individuals with NGT who were aged &lt;45 (P = 0.002) but not in 91 unrelated control individuals without a family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When normoglycemic individuals aged &lt;45 were separated into three classes by BMI (&lt; or =27, 27-30, &gt;30), S(I) decreased progressively and significantly with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> whereas AIRglucose rose significantly from lean to most <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> classes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the expectation of complete beta-cell compensation with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> D1 fell significantly (P = 0.004) among <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This relationship was not observed in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with a genetic predisposition to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> show a reduced beta-cell compensatory response to the reduced insulin sensitivity associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We propose that this impaired compensation may be one manifestation of the underlying genetic defect in susceptible individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This finding helps explain the multiplicative effects of family history and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> on risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
