<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ppargc1a-null mice develop systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidaemia</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>hepatic steatosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In humans, NEFAs downregulate PPARGC1A expression in skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a common non-synonymous coding variant at PPARGC1A (Gly482Ser, rs8192678) is associated with decreased PPARGC1A <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels and increased type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a population-based sample of 691 healthy middle-aged Europids we assessed whether Gly482Ser is associated with levels of NEFA when fasting and in response to an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also assessed the potential effect-modifying role of adipose tissue mass on these phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After adjustment for age, sex, fat mass and fat-free mass, the Ser482 allele associated with higher NEFA at 30 min and 2 h and with NEFA AUC (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> values p&lt;or=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, suggestive evidence of interaction between fat mass and Gly482Ser was observed for fasting NEFA (p=0.059) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After stratification by level of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, genotype associations were observed in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> for fasting NEFA (p=0.028) and NEFA at 30 min (p=0.013) and 2 h (p=0.002), and with NEFA AUC (p=0.005), but no significant associations were observed in lean individuals (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> values p&gt;0.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our observations indicate that NEFA clearance is blunted following a <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> load in carriers of the PPARCG1A Ser482 allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This association is augmented by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
