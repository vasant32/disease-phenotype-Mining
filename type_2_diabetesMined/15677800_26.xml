<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To create a simple prediction rule that could perform as well as the 2-h postchallenge plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (PCPG) test to predict those at risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We created a prediction rule in one sample and prospectively validated it for incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a separate cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis with data from the Rancho Bernardo Study (age 67 +/- 11 years) to derive a rule predicting abnormal PCPG &gt;/=140 mg/dl, using demographic, clinical, and laboratory data of nondiabetic participants with fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) &lt;126 mg/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data from the Health, Aging and Body Composition study (age 74 +/- 3 years) were used to prospectively validate this rule for incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and compare it with the predictive ability of the PCPG test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 1,549 RBS participants, 514 (33%) had PCPG &gt;/=140 mg/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Female sex, age, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, and FPG were most significantly associated with abnormal PCPG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on standardized beta-coefficients, we allotted 1 point for female sex, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> &gt;/=150 mg/dl, or FPG 95-104 mg/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Age &gt;/=70 years or FPG 105-115 mg/dl were given 2 points, and FPG 116-125 mg/dl received 3 points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the validation cohort, this simple prediction rule was as good as the 2-h PCPG test for predicting incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (C-statistic: 0.71 for both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Advanced age, female sex, FPG, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> were able to predict adults at risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> equally well as the 2-h PCPG test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Using this rule, clinicians may better identify older persons who should receive intensive lifestyle intervention to prevent type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
