<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: OGTTs were performed and anthropometric data were compared between five <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients (BMI 27-33 kg/m(2)) following BPD and seven <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients after a low-energy diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Insulin secretion was computed by C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> deconvolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp was performed only in the BPD group and the M value measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One month after BPD, fasting and 2 h post-OGTT glycaemia decreased from 15.22 +/- 3.22 to 6.22 +/- 0.51 mmol/l (p = 0.043), while insulin sensitivity increased significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant changes were observed in the low-energy diet group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Insulin secretion did not differ significantly after either intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> amelioration (change in HbA(1c) level) was observed up to 18 months after BPD without pharmacological therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: BPD can achieve adequate control of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> also in patients with BMI &lt;35 kg/m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The rapid postoperative remission of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is primarily related to an improvement in insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
