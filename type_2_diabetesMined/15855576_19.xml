<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> commonly have a greater degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> for their level of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal impairment</z:e> than those presenting with other causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To clarify the contribution and differing roles of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> in diabetic patients, we examined the hematologic and hematinic parameters of diabetic patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study group was comprised of 62 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who had been followed for a median of 7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For the study, these patients had additional samples taken during their annual routine blood testing for the measurement of extra parameters, including serum ferritin, serum erythropoietin (Epo) levels, and the percentage of reticulocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These measurements were combined with the routine parameters Hb, hematocrit, HbA(1c), and glomerular filtration rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 8 of the 45 male patients (17.8%) and 2 of the 17 female patients (11.8%) were classified as anemic (Hb &lt;13g/dl and &lt;11.5g/dl, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although only a small number of the patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> as defined by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values, a retrospective analysis of individual patients over time revealed a sustained though small decrease in Hb from initial presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A statistically significant difference in Epo levels (P = 0.016 by Kruskal-Wallis test) was observed from the group with the lowest (Hb &lt; or =11.5) to that with the highest (Hb &gt; or =14.5) Hb values, with a median Epo value of 37 (interquartile range 24-42) vs. 13 (9-15) IU/l, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, there was no evidence of an increased reticulocyte response to higher levels of Epo (r = 0.134 [Pearsons], P = 0.36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reticulocyte counts ranged from 44 (38-57) to 76.5 (56-83) in the lowest and highest Hb groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although only a small number of subjects in the group were overtly anemic, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects had an ongoing, small but significant decrease in Hb since presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study of diabetic patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> shows an expected increase in Epo production in response to lowering levels of Hb but without the expected reticulocyte response </plain></SENT>
