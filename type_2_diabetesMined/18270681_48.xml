<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The transcriptional coactivator peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha (protein <z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi>-1alpha; gene PPARGC1A) is a master regulator of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> genes and its expression is decreased and related to impaired oxidative phosphorylation in muscle from patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whether it plays a similar role in human pancreatic islets is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We therefore investigated if PPARGC1A expression is altered in islets from patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and whether this expression is influenced by genetic (PPARGC1A Gly482Ser polymorphism) and epigenetic (DNA methylation) factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also tested if experimental downregulation of PPARGC1A expression in human islets influenced insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The PPARGC1A Gly482Ser polymorphism was genotyped in human pancreatic islets from 48 non-diabetic and 12 type 2 diabetic multi-organ donors and related to PPARGC1A <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DNA methylation of the PPARGC1A promoter was analysed in pancreatic islets from ten type 2 diabetic and nine control donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Isolated human islets were transfected with PPARGC1A silencing <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (siRNA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PPARGC1A <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was reduced by 90% (p&lt;0.005) and correlated with the reduction in insulin secretion in islets from patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After downregulation of PPARGC1A expression in human islets by siRNA, insulin secretion was reduced by 41% (p &lt;or= 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We were able to ascribe reduced PPARGC1A expression in islets to both genetic and epigenetic factors, i.e. a common PPARGC1A Gly482Ser polymorphism was associated with reduced PPARGC1A <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression (p&lt;0.00005) and <z:mp ids='MP_0003059'>reduced insulin secretion</z:mp> (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In support of an epigenetic influence, the PPARGC1A gene promoter showed a twofold increase in DNA methylation in diabetic islets compared with non-diabetic islets (p&lt;0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We have shown for the first time that PPARGC1A might be important in human islet insulin secretion and that expression of PPARGC1A in human islets can be regulated by both genetic and epigenetic factors </plain></SENT>
