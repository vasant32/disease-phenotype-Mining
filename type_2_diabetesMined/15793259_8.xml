<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since abnormalities in beta-cell function play a role in the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, a mutation in the betacellulin gene could potentially contribute to the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using RT-PCR, we initially determined that betacellulin was expressed in 9- to 24-week-old human fetal pancreas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We then screened the betacellulin gene for mutations in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and identified seven polymorphisms in segments encompassing the 5' untranslated region (G-233C, A-226G), exon 1 (TGC19GGC, Cys7Gly), exon 2 (CTC130TTC, Leu44Phe), exon 4 (TTG370ATG, Leu124Met), intron 2 (T-31C), and intron 4 (C-4T) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These polymorphisms were genotyped in an expanded set of diabetic case and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among African Americans (n = 334), the frequency of the Gly7 allele in exon 1 was 31.9% in diabetic case subjects compared with 45.1% in nondiabetic control subjects (P = 0.0004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Allele frequencies for the other polymorphisms did not differ significantly between African-American case and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, there were no significant differences in allele frequencies between case and control subjects among the Caucasian sample (n = 426) for any of the seven polymorphisms, including the Gly7 variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further studies will be needed to understand the different roles that betacellulin polymorphisms play in susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Caucasians and African Americans </plain></SENT>
