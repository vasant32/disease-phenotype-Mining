<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to estimate this using a laboratory evaluation of autonomic function and a validated self-report measure of autonomic symptoms in patients and matched control subjects from the population-based Rochester <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011882" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Diabetic Neuropathy</z:e> Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Participants included 231 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (type 1, n=83; type 2, n=148) and 245 healthy age-matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We assessed symptoms using a validated self-report instrument (Autonomic Symptom Profile) and evaluated the severity and distribution of autonomic deficits (cardiovagal, sudomotor, adrenergic) with the objective, laboratory-based Composite Autonomic Severity Score (CASS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Autonomic symptoms were present more commonly in type 1 than in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, with symptoms of orthostatic intolerance, secretomotor, urinary control, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002360'>sleep disturbance</z:hpo> and pupillomotor, vasomotor, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000802'>erectile dysfunction</z:hpo> significantly increased over healthy control subjects in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of autonomic impairment was 54% in type 1 and 73% in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393911" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autonomic failure</z:e> was mild overall (mean CASS 2.3; maximum 10), with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001278'>orthostatic hypotension</z:hpo> occurring in 8.4 and 7.4% of type 1 and 2 diabetic patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fourteen percent of patients had a CASS &gt; or =5, indicating moderate to severe generalized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393911" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autonomic failure</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The correlation of symptoms with autonomic deficits (CASS) was better in type 1 than type 2 diabetic subjects and was weak overall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that autonomic symptoms and deficits are common in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but mild in severity, and that the correlation between symptom scores and deficits is overall weak in mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011882" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic neuropathy</z:e>, emphasizing the need to separately evaluate autonomic symptoms </plain></SENT>
