<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> is commonly used in the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and has known vasculoprotective effects beyond its hypoglycemic ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to investigate the vascular effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> in first-degree relatives with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> of type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study included 31 subjects (age 38.3 +/- 7.6 years and BMI 36.3 +/- 5.2 kg/m2), who were first-degree relatives of type 2 diabetic patients and who had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The subjects were randomly assigned 1:1 in a double-blind fashion to receive placebo (n = 15) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (n = 16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endothelial function was assessed by venous occlusion plethysmography, measuring forearm blood flow (FBF) and vascular resistance responses to three intra-arterial infusions of endothelium-dependent (<z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> 7.5, 15, and 30 microg/min) and independent (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi> 2, 4, and 8 microg/min) <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilators</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Weight, BMI, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, waist, and laboratory parameters (<z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> [FPG]) were assessed at baseline and after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and placebo groups did not differ in anthropometric, clinical, laboratory, and vascular measurements at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> group had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004325'>decreased weight</z:hpo>, BMI, systolic blood pressure, and FPG and improved <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Endothelium-dependent FBF responses were also improved, without any effect on endothelium-independent responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between the improvement on FBF responses and the observed changes on anthropometric, clinical, and laboratory parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> improved vascular endothelial reactivity in first-degree relatives with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> of type 2 diabetic patients, independently of its known antihyperglycemic effects </plain></SENT>
