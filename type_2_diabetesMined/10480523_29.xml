<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Serum levels of AGEs and <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> were measured with an immunoassay in 32 men and 21 women aged 59.3+/-6.2 years (means +/- SD) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> for 7.3 + 3.1 years and in 17 men and 17 women aged 56.2+/-4.2 years without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 18 had CHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The serum levels of AGEs and <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> were significantly increased in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with nondiabetic control subjects (median [5th-95th percentile]: AGEs 7.4 [4.4-10.9] vs. 4.2 [1.6-6.4] U/ml, P &lt; 0.0001; <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> 15.6 [5.6-29.9] vs. 8.6 [4.4-25.9] U/ml, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median level of AGEs but not <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> was significantly increased in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and CHD compared with patients without CHD (8.1 [6.4-10.9] vs. 7.1 [3.5-9.8] U/ml, P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were significant positive correlations between serum levels of AGEs and <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> in both patients and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Levels of AGEs and <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> were significantly increased in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with nondiabetic control subjects, and levels of AGEs but not <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> were significantly higher in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and CHD than in patients without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
