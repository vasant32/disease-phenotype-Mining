<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Homocysteine</z:chebi> concentrations were measured in frozen sera of 396 diabetic participants in a longitudinal study who were 40 years of age or older and who had attended one or more examinations between 1982 and 1985 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>Retinopathy</z:hpo> was assessed by fundoscopy and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> by an albumin:<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio greater than 300 mg/g </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence rate ratio for a 5 micro mol/l difference in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> was calculated using proportional hazard regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidence of each complication was assessed in subjects without that complication at baseline and with more than one follow-up examination: 229 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, 212 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> and 266 for proliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 101 incident cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, 113 of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> and 40 of proliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> during a mean follow-up of 8.6, 7.5 and 8.9 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> was associated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> concentrations: IRR=1.42 (95% CI, 1.09-1.84, p=0.01); this remained statistically significant controlled for age, sex and duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (p=0.03), but not when controlled for baseline renal function (p=0.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Homocysteine</z:chebi> concentrations were not associated with the incidence of any <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> IRR=1.14 (95%CI 0.89-1.46, p=0.3) but were associated with the incidence of proliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> IRR=1.62 (95% CI 1.16-2.28, p=0.005); this association remained statistically significant when controlled for baseline renal function and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration (p=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> concentrations are associated with an increased risk for incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> and proliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>; the relation with incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> seems to be explained by an association with baseline <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> status concentrations, whereas the relation with incidence of proliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> does not </plain></SENT>
