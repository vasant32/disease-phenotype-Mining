<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to assess the role of free fatty acids (FFAs) as insulin secretagogues in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To this end, basal insulin secretion rates (ISR) in response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> increases in plasma FFAs were evaluated in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and in age- and weight-matched nondiabetic control subjects during 1) intravenous infusion of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (L/H), which stimulated intravascular lipolysis, and 2) the FFA rebound, which followed lowering of plasma FFAs with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15940">nicotinic acid</z:chebi> (NA) and was a consequence of <z:mp ids='MP_0008034'>increased lipolysis</z:mp> from the subject's own adipose tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At comparable euglycemia, diabetic patients had similar ISR but higher plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB) levels during L/H infusion and higher plasma FFA and beta-OHB levels during the FFA rebound than nondiabetic control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Correlating ISR with plasma FFA plus beta-OHB levels showed that in response to the same changes in FFA plus beta-OHB levels, diabetic patients secreted approximately 30% less insulin than nondiabetic control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, twice as much insulin was secreted during L/H infusion as during the FFA rebound in response to the same FFA/beta-OHB stimulation by both diabetic patients and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">Glycerol</z:chebi>, which was present in the infused <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> (272 mmol/l) did not affect ISR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We concluded that 1) assessment of FFA effects on ISR requires consideration of effects on ISR by <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17087">ketone</z:chebi> bodies; 2) ISR responses to FFA/beta-OHB were defective in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (partial beta-cell <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo>), but this defect was compensated by elevated plasma levels of FFAs and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17087">ketone</z:chebi> bodies; and 3) approximately two times more insulin was released per unit change in plasma FFA plus beta-OHB during L/H infusion than during the FFA rebound after NA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The reason for this remains to be explored </plain></SENT>
