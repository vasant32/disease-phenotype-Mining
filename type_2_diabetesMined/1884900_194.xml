<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In a population-based survey of 2,930 subjects, prevalence rates for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, hypertriglyceridaemia, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020443" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercholesterolaemia</z:e> were 54.3, 9.3, 11.1, 9.8, 10.3 and 9.2%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prevalence, however, of each of these conditions in its isolated form (free of the other five) was 29.0% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, 1.3% for Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 1.8% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo>, 1.5% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, 1.0% for hypertriglyceridaemia, and 1.7% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020443" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercholesterolaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two-by-two associations were even rarer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The large differences in prevalence between isolated and mixed forms indicate a major overlap among the six disorders in multiple combinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the isolated form, each condition was characterized by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020459" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperinsulinaemia</z:e> (both fasting and 2 h after oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>), suggesting the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, in any isolated condition most of the variables categorising other members of the sextet were still significantly altered in comparison with 1,049 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the whole of the subjects who presented with one or another disorder (1,881 of 2,930 or 64%), marked fasting and post-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020459" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperinsulinaemia</z:e> was associated with higher body mass index, waist:hip ratio, fasting and post-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> glycaemia, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> and total cholesterol levels, and with lower <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> concentrations (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that (1) insulin sensitivity, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, blood pressure, body fat mass and distribution, and serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> are a network of mutually interrelated functions; and (2) an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> syndrome underlies each and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the six disorders carrying an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
