<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of switching from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> to liraglutide in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>-treated adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In an open-label trial, participants randomized to receive either liraglutide (1.2 or 1.8 mg/day) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> (100 mg/day), each added to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, continued treatment for 52 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a 26-week extension, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi>-treated participants were randomly allocated to receive instead liraglutide at either 1.2 or 1.8 mg/day, while participants originally randomized to receive liraglutide continued unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although 52 weeks of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> changed glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA(1c)) by -0.9% from baseline, additional decreases occurred after switching to liraglutide (1.2 mg/day, -0.2%, P = 0.006; 1.8 mg/day, -0.5%, P = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conversion to liraglutide was associated with reductions in fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) (1.2 mg/day, -0.8 mmol/L, P = 0.0004; 1.8 mg/day, -1.4 mmol/L, P &lt; 0.0001) and body weight (1.2 mg/day, -1.6 kg; 1.8 mg/day, -2.5 kg; both P &lt; 0.0001) and with an increased proportion of patients reaching HbA(1c) &lt;7% (from ∼30% to ∼50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall treatment satisfaction, assessed by the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire, improved after switching to liraglutide (pooled 1.2 and 1.8 mg/day, 1.3; P = 0.0189) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After switching, mostly transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> occurred in 21% of participants, and minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> remained low (3-4% of participants) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Continuing liraglutide treatment at 1.2 mg/day and 1.8 mg/day for 78 weeks reduced HbA(1c) (baseline 8.3 and 8.4%, respectively) by -0.9 and -1.3%, respectively; FPG by -1.3 and -1.7 mmol/L, respectively; and weight by -2.6 and -3.1 kg, respectively, with 9-10% of participants reporting minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Glycemic control, weight, and treatment satisfaction improved after switching from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> to liraglutide, albeit with a transient increase in gastrointestinal reactions </plain></SENT>
