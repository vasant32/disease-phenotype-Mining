<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This study builds on a within-trial cost-efficacy analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The analysis compares the lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) between the two intervention groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intervention costs were extrapolated based on observed resource utilization during the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proportion of patients in each intervention group with remission of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at 2 years was the same as that observed in the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Health care costs for patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and outcome variables required to derive estimates of QALYs were sourced from published literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A health care system perspective was adopted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Costs and outcomes were discounted annually at 3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Costs are presented in 2006 Australian dollars (AUD) (currency exchange: 1 AUD = 0.74 USD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean number of years in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> remission over a lifetime was 11.4 for surgical therapy patients and 2.1 for conventional therapy patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Over the remainder of their lifetime, surgical and conventional therapy patients lived 15.7 and 14.5 discounted QALYs, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean discounted lifetime costs were 98,900 AUD per surgical therapy patient and 101,400 AUD per conventional therapy patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Relative to conventional therapy, surgically induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> was associated with a mean health care saving of 2,400 AUD and 1.2 additional QALYs per patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Surgically induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> is a dominant intervention (it both saves health care costs and generates health benefits) for managing recently diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in class I/II <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients in Australia </plain></SENT>
