<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It is widely known that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>) is an established risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, recent studies reported that serum levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B (Apo B) and Apo B to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> A-1 (Apo A-1) ratio were better predictors of atherosclerotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated that Apo B concentrations and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-R) can be good markers of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-six type 2 diabetic patients with carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and 66 age- and sex-matched patients without carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The usefulness in risk assessment of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>, Apo B, and HOMA-R for carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> were estimated by receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The percentage of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in combination with two of these markers was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Type 2 diabetic patients with carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> had significantly higher body mass index, higher blood pressure, higher <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>, and Apo B, and higher HOMA-R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ranking of the area under the ROC curve was Apo B, HOMA-R, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> (0.70, 0.69, and 0.66, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The percentage of patients with carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and high <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> was 60.7%, high <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>+high HOMA-R was 77.4%, and high Apo B+high HOMA-R was 90.9%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The usefulness of these combinations was significantly better than that of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> alone (p&lt;0.05 and p&lt;0.01, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the combination of Apo B and HOMA-R is a superior marker of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> alone in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
