<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ECs, EC anabolic and catabolic enzymes and cannabinoid receptors constitute the EC signalling system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This system participates in the control of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism at several levels, with the possible endpoint of the accumulation of energy as fat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following unbalanced energy intake, however, the EC system becomes dysregulated, and in most cases overactive, in several organs participating in energy homeostasis, particularly, in intra-abdominal adipose tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This dysregulation might contribute to excessive visceral fat accumulation and reduced adiponectin release from this tissue, and to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of several cardiometabolic risk factors that are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon might form the basis of the mechanism of action of CB1 <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi>/inverse <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi>, recently developed by several pharmaceutical companies as adjuvants to lifestyle modification for weight reduction, glycaemic control and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidaemia</z:e> in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It also helps to explain why some of the beneficial actions of these new therapeutics appear to be partly independent from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
