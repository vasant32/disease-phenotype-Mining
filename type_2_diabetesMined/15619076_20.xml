<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 160 microalbuminuric type 2 diabetic patients (mean age 55.1 years [SD 7.2], 119 men) were enrolled in the Steno-2 Study examining the effect of multifactorial treatment, and were divided into two groups according to baseline levels of plasma NT-proBNP below or above the median for the cohort, which was followed for an average of 7.8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular outcome was a composite of cardiovascular mortality, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, revascularisation procedures in the heart or legs, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputations</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the whole group, plasma NT-proBNP being above the median was associated with an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> during follow-up, with an unadjusted hazard ratio of 4.4 (95% CI 2.3-8.4; p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A decrease in plasma NT-proBNP of 10 pg/ml during the first 2 years of intervention was associated with a 1% relative reduction in the primary endpoint (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite polypharmacological treatment targeting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, the mean plasma NT-proBNP level increased during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We conclude that high plasma NT-proBNP is a major risk marker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
