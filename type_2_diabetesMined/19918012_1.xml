<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the potential of carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) for prediction of abnormal myocardial perfusion in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: CIMT and SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging were assessed in 98 asymptomatic patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An increased CIMT was defined as &gt; or =75th percentile of reference values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS Increased CIMT was an independent predictor of the extent of abnormal perfusion (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with increased CIMT as compared with patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CIMT, abnormal perfusion (75 vs. 9%) and severely abnormal perfusion (28 vs. 3%) were observed more frequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Increased CIMT was significantly related to the presence and extent of abnormal myocardial perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Assessment of CIMT may be useful to identify asymptomatic patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at higher risk for CAD </plain></SENT>
