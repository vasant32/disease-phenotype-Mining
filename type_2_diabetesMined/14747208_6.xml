<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: In the U.K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prospective <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study, A1C increased from 1.2 to 1.7% and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> from 1.0 to 2.8 mmol/l over 10 years in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is not known whether the blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> increase observed in long-term studies of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> results from small, steady increases throughout the year or from increases during discrete periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: To estimate the variation of actual glycemic control and its relation to holiday times, we measured A1C and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24103">fructosamine</z:chebi> in 110 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These measurements were performed four times at intervals of 4-6 weeks; therefore, glycemic change was determined for three periods: preholiday period (from between November 13 and December 20 to between December 20 and January 20), holiday period (from between December 20 and January 20 to between January 28 and February 28), and postholiday period (from between January 28 and February 28 to between March 1 and April 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A final measurement of A1C was obtained from 90 subjects in the following December or January </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean A1C increased, but not significantly, during the preholiday (increase 0.135 +/- 0.723%, P = 0.055) and holiday (increase 0.094 +/- 0.828%, P = 0.239) periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean A1C decreased, but not significantly, during the postholiday period (decrease 0.022 +/- 0.588%, P = 0.695) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Altogether, the A1C change during these three periods increased significantly (increase 0.207 +/- 0.943%, P = 0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24103">fructosamine</z:chebi> increased significantly during the preholiday period (increase 0.151 +/- 0.460 mmol/l, P = 0.001), but there was no significant change during the holiday period (increase 0.057 +/- 0.593 mmol/l, P = 0.321) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24103">fructosamine</z:chebi> decreased significantly during the postholiday period (decrease 0.178 +/- 0.448 mmol/l, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Altogether, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24103">fructosamine</z:chebi> changes during the study periods showed no significant difference (increase 0.030 +/- 0.566 mmol/l, P = 0.579) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Between March or early April and the following December or January, there was no additional change in A1C (decrease 0.009 +/- 1.039%, P = 0.935) for the 90 participants who returned for follow-up treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates an influence of winter holidays on the glycemic control of patients who have type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and this poor glycemic control might not be reversed during the summer and autumn months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the cumulative effects of the yearly A1C gain during the winter holidays are likely to contribute to the substantial increase in A1C that occurs every year among type 2 diabetic individuals </plain></SENT>
