<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Little information is available on cholesterol absorption and synthesis in human type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied these variables using serum cholesterol precursor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15889">sterol</z:chebi> ratios to cholesterol as surrogate markers of cholesterol synthesis and those of cholestanol and plant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15889">sterols</z:chebi> to reflect cholesterol absorption in seven type 1 diabetic subjects and in five age- and body weight-matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Total and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50404">lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> levels were similar, but <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> in intermediate-density <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> (IDL) and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> were higher in type 1 diabetic than in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most of the marker <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15889">sterols</z:chebi> were transported by <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The percentage of esterified cholesterol was lower in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>-rich <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> in diabetic patients than in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ratios of the absorption marker <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15889">sterols</z:chebi> in serum were higher, and those of the synthesis markers were lower in type 1 diabetic than in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The increased cholestanol ratios were seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi>, and those of free and total plant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15889">sterols</z:chebi> were mainly in <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>, whereas the decreased free and total synthesis markers were mainly in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, high absorption and low synthesis marker <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15889">sterols</z:chebi> seem to characterize human type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings could be related to low expression of ABC G/5 G/8 genes, resulting in high absorption of cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15889">sterols</z:chebi> in general and low synthesis of cholesterol compared with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
