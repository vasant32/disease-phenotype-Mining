<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study was a 50-week, double-blind extension of a 54-week, randomized, double-blind, factorial study of the initial combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> monotherapy (104 weeks total duration) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients assigned to active therapy in the 54-week base study remained on those treatments in the extension study: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> 50 mg b.i.d. + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> 1000 mg b.i.d </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients randomized to receive the sequence of placebo/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> were switched, in a blinded manner, from placebo to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy uptitrated to 1000 mg b.i.d. beginning at week 24 and remained on higher dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> through the extension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Amongst patients who entered the extension study without having initiated glycaemic rescue therapy, least-squares mean changes in HbA(1c) from baseline at week 104 were -1.7% (higher dose combination), -1.4% (lower dose combination), -1.3% (higher dose), -1.1% (lower dose) and -1.2% (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The proportions of patients with an HbA(1c) &lt;7% at week 104 were 60% (higher dose combination), 45% (lower dose combination), 45% (higher dose), 28% (lower dose) and 32% (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Fasting and postmeal measures of glycaemic control and beta-cell function improved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups, with glycaemic responses generally maintained over the 104-week treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> was low across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The incidences of gastrointestinal adverse experiences were generally lower in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> group and similar between the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy and combination groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Initial combination therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and monotherapy with either drug alone provided substantial and sustained glycaemic improvements and were well tolerated over 104 weeks in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
