<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of the Pro(12)Ala variant of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma2 gene on changes in fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in response to exercise training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study population comprised 139 sedentary type 2 diabetic patients (age: 54.4+/-7.2; HbA(1)c: 7.7+/-0.9%) who completed 3 months of supervised exercise training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome variable in our analysis was the post-intervention change in blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other assessments included measures of body composition, insulin sensitivity indices and maximal oxygen uptake (VO(2max)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequency of the Ala allele was 8.3% and the genotypes were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At baseline, neither body composition variables (weight, BMI, waist circumference), <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis variables (<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, HbA(1)c, homeostasis model assessment method) nor VO(2max) were different between genotypes (<z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp>: Pro(12)Pro n=117, Ala carriers: X(12)Ala n=22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The exercise-training intervention led to similar improvements in body composition and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis variables in both genotype groups (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The change in fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was significantly different between PPARgamma2 genotypes (-1.66 mmol/l vs -0.54 mmol/l, Ala carriers and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp>, respectively) (p=0.034 unadjusted and p=0.089 including baseline <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>) and the significant association between genotype and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> response remained after adjusting for statistically significant predictors (age, changes in insulin and BMI [p=0.015]) and including baseline <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin and BMI (p=0.031) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These data suggest that the Pro(12)Ala polymorphism may influence the glycaemic response to exercise in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
