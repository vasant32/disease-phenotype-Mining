<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Male spontaneously hypertensive rats were treated with 25.0, 37.5, 50.0, 62.5 or 75.0 mg/kg of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> given intraperitoneally at 2 days of age and maintained for 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the rats which received 50.0 mg/kg or more <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi>, overt <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> gradually and consistently developed following incomplete recovery from an initial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared to vehicle-treated controls, body <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> in these animals did not differ for the first 8 weeks; thereafter, it was slightly but significantly (p less than 0.05) reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The animals treated with 25.0 or 37.5 mg/kg <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> developed mild to moderate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e>, but their body <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> was similar to controls </plain></SENT>
