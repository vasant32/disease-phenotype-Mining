<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations of SF-1 gene cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disorders</z:e> like <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in both human and mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study is to examine whether the Gly146Ala variation in the gene for SF-1, that is known to impair SF-1 function and related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001621" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adrenal disorders</z:e>, affects susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Hundred and fifty-one type 2 diabetic subjects and 141 non-diabetic control subjects of Han Chinese were recruited and the SF-1 genotype were analyzed by PCR-RFLP method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The Gly146Ala variation occurs frequently in the Han Chinese </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Allele Ala frequency in the control subjects (27.3%) was significantly lower than that in type 2 diabetic subjects (37.1%, chi2=6.37, p=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Gly/Ala and Ala/Ala genotypes frequencies were also higher in diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In both the diabetic and control populations, subjects carrying allele Ala, as compared to those not, had higher fasting insulin levels and higher HOMA values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The SF-1 Gly146Ala variation may constitute a susceptible factor for development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and impairment of insulin actions </plain></SENT>
