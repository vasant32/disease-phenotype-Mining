<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the effect of intensive multifactorial treatment in general practice on indices of peripheral and central hemodynamics among patients with screen-detected <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: As part of a population-based screening and intervention study in general practice, 1,533 Danes aged 40-69 years were clinically diagnosed with screen-detected <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>General practitioners were randomized to provide intensive multifactorial treatment or routine care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After a mean follow-up of 6.2 years, an unselected subsample of 456 patients underwent central hemodynamic assessments by applanation tonometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Central pressure was derived from the radial pulse wave </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Aortic stiffness was assessed as carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (aPWV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The intervention effect on each index of central hemodynamics was analyzed by mixed-effects models adjusted for heart rate, cluster randomization, age, and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At screening, median age was 59.2 years (interquartile range 55.2-64.6); 289 patients (63%) were in the intensive treatment group, and 278 patients (61%) were men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients in the intensive treatment group had a 0.51 m/s (95% CI -0.96 to -0.05, P = 0.03) lower aPWV compared with routine care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Respective differences for central augmentation index (-0.84% [-2.54 to 0.86]), pulse pressure (0.28 mmHg [-1.75 to 2.32]), and systolic (-1.42 mmHg [-4.47 to 1.64]) and diastolic (-1.79 mmHg [-3.72 to 0.14]) blood pressure were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intensive multifactorial treatment of screen-detected <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during 6 years in general practice has a significant impact on aortic stiffness, whereas the effects on other hemodynamic measures are smaller and not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
