<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a genome-wide search for fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> as a quantitative trait in 412 young European sib-pairs including <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> children, with adjustment for sex, age, and BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We identified more quantitative trait loci specific to fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and more significant than would be found by simple chance estimated by permutation tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The strongest linkage was on chromosome 2q (logarithm of odds [LOD] = 3.00) in a region previously linked to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> as a disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also found linkage signals of fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> with 7q (LOD = 2.03), 8q (1.28), 17p (2.12), 17q (1.4), and 11p (1.33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the quantitative genetics of fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> could contribute to the search for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> genes </plain></SENT>
