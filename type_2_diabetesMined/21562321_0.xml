<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Ethnicity has been identified as a risk factor not only for having type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> but for increased morbidity and mortality with the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Current American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association (<z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi>) guidelines advocate screening high-risk minorities for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study investigates the effect of minority status on <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> screening practices in an ambulatory, insured population presenting for yearly health care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This is a retrospective population-based study of patients in a large, Midwestern, academic group practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Included patients were insured, had ≥1 primary care visit yearly from 2003 to 2007, and did not have <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> but met <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> criteria for screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios (ORs), 95% confidence intervals (CI), and predicted probabilities were calculated to determine the relationship between screening with fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c) and patient and visit characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 15,557 eligible patients, 607 (4%) were of high-risk ethnicity, 61% were female, and 86% were ≥45 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the eight high-risk factors studied, after adjustment, ethnicity was the only factor not associated with higher <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> screening (OR = 0.90 [95% CI 0.76-1.08]) despite more primary care visits in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In overweight patients &lt;45 years, where screening eligibility is based on having an additional risk factor, high-risk ethnicity (OR 1.01 [0.70-1.44]) was not associated with increased screening frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In an insured population presenting for routine care, high-risk minority status did not independently lead to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> screening as recommended by <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Factors other than insurance or access to care appear to affect minority-preventive care </plain></SENT>
