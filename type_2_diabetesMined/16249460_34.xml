<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TZDs can also be used to reduce rates of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in at-risk individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, a large fraction of TZD-treated patients (30-40%) do not respond to TZD treatment with an improvement in insulin sensitivity (Si) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that variation within the gene encoding PPARG may underlie this differential response to TZD therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We screened approximately 40 kb of PPARG in 93 nondiabetic Hispanic women (63 responders and 30 nonresponders) with previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> who had participated in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">Troglitazone</z:chebi> In the Prevention Of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TZD nonresponse was defined as the lower tertile in change in Si after 3 months of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Baseline demographic and clinical measures were not different between responders and nonresponders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We identified and genotyped 131 variants including 126 single nucleotide polymorphisms and 5 insertion-deletion polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Linkage disequilibrium analysis identified five haplotype blocks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eight variants were associated with TZD response (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three variants were also associated with changes in Si as a continuous variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that PPARG variation may underlie response to TZD therapy in women at risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
