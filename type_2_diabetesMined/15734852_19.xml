<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To identify potential mechanisms in the link between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> and catch-up fat during catch-up growth, we studied the in vivo action of insulin on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue in a previously described rat model of weight recovery exhibiting catch-up fat caused by suppressed thermogenesis per se </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To do this, we used euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamps associated with the labeled 2-deoxy-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 1 week of isocaloric refeeding, when body fat, circulating free fatty acids, or intramyocellular <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> in refed animals had not yet exceeded those of controls, insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization in refed animals was lower in skeletal muscles (by 20-43%) but higher in white adipose tissues (by two- to threefold) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, fatty acid synthase activity was higher in adipose tissues from refed animals than from fed controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that suppressed thermogenesis for the purpose of sparing <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> for catch-up fat, via the coordinated induction of skeletal muscle <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and adipose tissue insulin hyperresponsiveness, might be a central event in the link between catch-up growth, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> and risks for later <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
