<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Most studies on the genetic determinants of blood pressure and vascular complications of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have focused on the effects of single genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These studies often have yielded conflicting results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we examined the combined effects of three renin-angiotensin system (<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>) genes and three salt sensitivity genes in relation to blood pressure and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in the total population and type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study was a part of the Rotterdam Study, a population-based cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have genotyped three <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> gene polymorphisms and three salt sensitivity gene polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diabetic patients with three risk genotypes of the <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> genes had a 6.9 mmHg higher systolic blood pressure (P for trend = 0.04) and a 6.0 mmHg higher pulse pressure (P for trend = 0.03) than those who did not carry any risk genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Diabetic patients with three risk genotypes of the salt sensitivity genes had a 9.0 mmHg higher systolic blood pressure (P = 0.19) and a 13.1 mmHg higher pulse pressure (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Diabetic patients who carried three risk genotypes for the <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> genes had a higher mean intima-media thickness than those with two risk genotypes (mean difference 0.04 mm, P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found that among type 2 diabetic patients, mean systolic blood pressure, pulse pressure, and risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> increased with the number of risk genotypes for the <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> genes and the salt sensitivity genes </plain></SENT>
