<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine whether <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> function is impaired in type 2 diabetic (T2D) patients and whether 4F treatment improves <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> function in T2D patient plasma in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> anti-inflammatory function was determined in 93 T2D patients and 31 control subjects as the ability of test <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDLs</z:chebi> to inhibit <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-induced monocyte chemotactic activity in human aortic endothelial cell monolayers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> properties were measured using a cell-free assay that uses dichlorofluorescein diacetate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Oxidized fatty acids in <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDLs</z:chebi> were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In subgroups of patients and control subjects, the <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> inflammatory index was repeated after incubation with L-4F </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> inflammatory index was 1.42 ± 0.29 in T2D patients and 0.70 ± 0.19 in control subjects (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cell-free assay was impaired in T2D patients compared with control subjects (2.03 ± 1.35 vs. 1.60 ± 0.80, P &lt; 0.05), and also <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> intrinsic oxidation (cell-free assay without <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>) was higher in T2D patients (1,708 ± 739 vs. 1,233 ± 601 relative fluorescence units, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> measured oxidized fatty acids were significantly higher in the <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDLs</z:chebi> of T2D patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a significant correlation between the cell-free assay values and the content of oxidized fatty acids in <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> fractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>L-4F treatment restored the <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> inflammatory index in diabetic plasma samples (from 1.26 ± 0.17 to 0.71 ± 0.11, P &lt; 0.001) and marginally affected it in healthy subjects (from 0.81 ± 0.16 to 0.66 ± 0.10, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with T2D, the content of oxidized fatty acids is increased and the anti-inflammatory and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> activities of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDLs</z:chebi> are impaired </plain></SENT>
