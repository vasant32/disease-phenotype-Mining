<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Immune-mediated destruction of beta-cells resulting in type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> involves activation of proinflammatory, islet autoreactive T-cells, a process under the control of dendritic cells of the innate immune system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> development is associated with disturbance of blood dendritic cell subsets that could enhance islet-specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We examined blood dendritic cells (plasmacytoid and myeloid) in 40 patients with recent-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (median duration 28 days) and matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also examined the relative ability of different dendritic cell subsets to process and present soluble or immune complexed islet cell autoantigen (the islet tyrosine phosphatase IA-2) to responder CD4 T-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The balance of blood dendritic cells was profoundly disturbed at <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosis, with a significantly elevated proportion of plasmacytoid and reduction of myeloid cells compared with control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dendritic cell subset distribution was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in long-standing disease and in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both dendritic cell subsets processed and presented soluble IA-2 to CD4 T-cells after short-term culture, but only plasmacytoid dendritic cells enhanced (by as much as 100%) autoantigen presentation in the presence of IA-2(+) autoantibody patient serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The plasmacytoid subset of dendritic cells is overrepresented in the blood close to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and shows a distinctive ability to capture islet autoantigenic immune complexes and enhance autoantigen-driven CD4 T-cell activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This suggests a synergistic proinflammatory role for plasmacytoid dendritic cells and islet cell autoantibodies in type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
