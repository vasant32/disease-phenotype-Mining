<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="26607">Saturated fatty acids</z:chebi> (SFAs) such as <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> especially have lipotoxic effects leading to endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) stress, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="15541">Stearoyl-CoA</z:chebi> desaturase 1 (SCD1) plays a key role in preventing lipotoxic effects, as it converts SFAs to less harmful <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25413">monounsaturated fatty acids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we tested the hypothesis that individual differences in the regulation of SCD1 expression by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> exist and influence insulin sensitivity and the cellular response to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">Palmitate</z:chebi>-induced gene expression was studied in primary human myotubes of 39 metabolically characterized individuals, as well as in an SCD1-overexpressing cell culture model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SCD1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression and inducibility by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> in cultured myotubes showed a broad interindividual variation, presumably due to inheritable characteristics of the donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of SCD1 prevented the inflammatory and ER stress response to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In primary human myotubes, high SCD1 inducibility was associated with a low inflammatory (interleukin [IL]-6, IL-8, and chemokine [CXC motif] ligand 3 [CXCL3]) and ER stress (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein [C/EBP] homologous protein, activating transcription factor 3 [ATF3], and X-box binding protein 1 [XBP1]) response to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi>-stimulated SCD1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression, positively correlated with intramyocellular <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> (IMCL) content of the donors, was measured by (1)H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for IMCL, SCD1 expression and inducibility were positively correlated with insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesize that myocellular SCD1 inducibility by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> is an individual characteristic that modulates <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> storage, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi>-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, ER stress, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This may describe individuals with increased capability of innoxious free fatty acid handling and benign <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> storage </plain></SENT>
