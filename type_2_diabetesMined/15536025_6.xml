<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the context of an Italian nation-wide outcomes research program on type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we investigated the contribution of both patient and setting-related factors to patient satisfaction with their relationship with their physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The level of patient satisfaction was measured using the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM) 14 patient satisfaction questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The main results were obtained using multilevel analysis, a statistical technique that takes into account the clustered nature of our data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall, 3563 patients were recruited by 101 diabetologists and 103 general practitioners (GPs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Information on patients' satisfaction was available for 2515 patients (71% of the whole sample) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients' satisfaction was related to patient characteristics and attitudes, but not with physician's sex, age, speciality, and setting of care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In particular, patients who were less likely to delegate to physicians responsibility for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> management and those perceiving a lower degree of involvement in disease management showed lower levels of satisfaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lower satisfaction scores were also related to lower levels of school education, more severe clinical conditions, and lower psychological adaptation to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, patients reporting higher levels of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> related worries and more frequent encounters with health care providers showed higher levels of satisfaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, patient satisfaction with physicians' humanness and communication skills is strongly related to personal characteristics, attitudes, expectations, and perceived health </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In deciding the best decision-making approach to adopt in individual patients, it is of primary importance to measure how the patient perceives and engages in relationships </plain></SENT>
