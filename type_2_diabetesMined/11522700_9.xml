<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Elderly Hispanic individuals (n = 414) and non-Hispanic white individuals (n = 469) aged &gt; or =65 years, randomly selected from the Medicare rolls of Bernalillo County (Albuquerque), NM, were recruited for an interview/examination that included an evaluation of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Information on nine tests of cognitive function and two measures of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> allowed comparisons between diabetic status and these functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Comparisons also were made between glycosolated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentrations and these cognitive tests in the 188 participants with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: None of the mean scores on the tests of cognitive function was significantly lower in the participants with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with those participants with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance after adjustments for ethnicity, sex, age, level of education, and presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, with or without elimination of those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (Mini-Mental State Exam &lt;18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, participants with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> tended to score higher than those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant associations were found between glycosolated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentrations and cognitive test scores in participants with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We could not show any increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in participants with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance after adjustments for ethnicity, sex, age, education, and presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, before or after elimination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in this random sample from a biethnic population of predominantly community-dwelling elders </plain></SENT>
