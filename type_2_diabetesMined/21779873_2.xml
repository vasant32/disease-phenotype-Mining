<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Prevention Program (DPP), increased proinsulin levels predicted type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and proinsulin levels were significantly reduced following treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, lifestyle modification or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> compared with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genetic and physiological studies suggest a role for the zinc transporter gene SLC30A8 in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk, possibly through effects on insulin-processing in beta cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesised that the risk allele at the type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-associated missense polymorphism rs13266634 (R325W) in SLC30A8 would predict proinsulin levels in individuals at risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and may modulate response to preventive interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We genotyped rs13266634 in 3,007 DPP participants and examined its association with fasting proinsulin and fasting insulin at baseline and at 1 year post-intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that increasing dosage of the C risk allele at SLC30A8 rs13266634 was significantly associated with higher proinsulin levels at baseline (p = 0.002) after adjustment for baseline insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This supports the hypothesis that risk alleles at SLC30A8 mark individuals with insulin-processing defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the 1 year analysis, proinsulin levels decreased significantly in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups receiving active intervention and were no longer associated with SLC30A8 genotype (p = 0.86) after adjustment for insulin at baseline and 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found no genotype × treatment interactions at 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetic</z:e> individuals, genotype at SLC30A8 predicts baseline proinsulin levels independently of insulin levels, but does not predict proinsulin levels after amelioration of insulin sensitivity at 1 year </plain></SENT>
