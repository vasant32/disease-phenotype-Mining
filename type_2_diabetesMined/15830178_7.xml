<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> are related, both in healthy people and those with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; however, people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are more prone to atheroma, even though their <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> levels are similar to those in their non-diabetic peers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is because <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> particles are modified in the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> to become more atherogenic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These modifications include glycation in response to high plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels; oxidative reactions mediated by increased <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>; and transfer of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17002">cholesterol ester</z:chebi>, which makes the particles smaller and denser </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The latter modification is strongly associated with hypertriglyceridaemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Oxidatively and non-oxidatively modified <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> is involved in plaque formation, and may thus contribute to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0004943'>accelerated atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This review discusses the techniques currently used to determine the physicochemical properties of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>, and examines the evidence that modification of these properties plays a role in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0004943'>accelerated atherosclerosis</z:hpo> associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
