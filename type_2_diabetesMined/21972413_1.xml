<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between aortic stiffness and incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> and the decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We investigated 461 Japanese type 2 diabetic patients, comprising 199 women and 262 men, with a mean age of 59 ± 11 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into two groups according to the median value of carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cf-PWV), which was used to evaluate aortic stiffness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The end point was defined as the transition from normo- to <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> or micro- to macroalbuminuria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Cox proportional hazard model was used to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% CI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The correlation between cf-PWV and rate of change in eGFR was also determined by linear regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The baseline mean (± SD) cf-PWV was 9.6 ± 2.4 m/s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During a median follow-up period of 5.9 years (range 0.3-8.6), progression of <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> was observed in 85 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 5-year cumulative incidence of the end point in patients with cf-PWV below and above the median was 8.5 and 19.4%, respectively (P = 0.002, log-rank test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>cf-PWV was significantly associated with incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> (HR 1.23, 95% CI 1.13-1.33, P &lt; 0.001) by multivariate Cox regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A significant association between cf-PWV and annual change in eGFR was also suggested by multiple linear regression analysis (standardized estimate -0.095, P = 0.031) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Aortic stiffness is associated with incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> and the rate of decline in glomerular filtration rate in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
