<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We examined the relationship between urinary excretion of markers of DNA oxidation (8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine [8-oxodG]) and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> oxidation (8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanosine [8-oxoGuo]) and long-term mortality using Cox proportional hazards regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After multivariate adjustment, the hazard ratios for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related mortality of patients with 8-oxoGuo levels in the highest quartile compared with those in the lowest quartile were 1.44 (1.12-1.85) and 1.54 (1.13-2.10), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conversely, no significant associations between 8-oxodG and mortality were found in the adjusted analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Urinary excretion of the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> oxidation marker 8-oxoGuo measured shortly after diagnosis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> predicts long-term mortality independently of conventional risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This finding suggests that 8-oxoGuo could serve as a new clinical biomarker in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
