<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 104 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were randomly assigned to either a low GI (GI) or CCE dietary advice over a 12-week period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary end-point was glycaemic control as assessed by glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA1c), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24103">fructosamine</z:chebi> level and plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The secondary end-points were anthropometric measurements and metabolic parameters that include blood pressure, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile and insulin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> medications remained unchanged throughout the duration of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A low-GI diet was associated with significant changes in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24103">fructosamine</z:chebi> level (DeltaGI = -0.20 +/- 0.03; DeltaCCE = -0.08 +/- 0.03 mmol/l, p &lt; 0.01) and waist circumference (DeltaGI group = -1.88 +/- 0.30 cm; DeltaCCE group: -0.36 +/- 0.4 cm, p &lt; 0.05) at week 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At week 12, the changes in fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (DeltaGI = -0.03 +/- 0.3; DeltaCCE = 0.7 +/- 0.3 mmol/l; p &lt; 0.05) and waist circumference (DeltaGI = -2.35 +/- 0.47 cm; DeltaCCE group = -0.66 +/- 0.46 cm; p &lt; 0.05) in the GI group was significantly lower than the CCE group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With the low-GI diet, the changes in postprandial glycaemia at time 0, 60, 150 and 180 min after consuming the standard test meal was lower than with the CCE diet (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found between the groups for the remaining parameters that were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Use of a low-GI diet resulted in significant changes of serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24103">fructosamine</z:chebi> level, plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and waist circumference in Asian patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> over a 12-week period compared with those following a CCE diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The effect on HbA1c and other metabolic parameters was not significantly different between the two study groups but the improvement within the GI group was more pronounced and of clinical benefit </plain></SENT>
