<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the hypothesis that imprinted genes may affect the propensity to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in Pima Indians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Multipoint variance component methods were used to assess linkage of BMI (kg/m(2)) and age-adjusted <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> to loci derived from either father (LOD(FA)) or mother (LOD(MO)) in a genome-wide scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Tentative evidence of loci where imprinted genes might be acting was found for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with maternally derived alleles on chromosomes 5 (LOD(MO) = 1.5) and 14 (LOD(MO) = 1.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Evidence of linkage of BMI to maternally derived alleles was found on chromosome 5 (LOD(MO) = 1.7) and to paternally derived alleles on chromosome 10p (LOD(FA) = 1.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additional analyses of sibling pairs who were affected by <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and younger than 25 years of age showed an increase of sharing of maternally derived alleles on chromosome 6 (LOD(MO) = 3.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also examined sites of a priori interest where action of imprinted genes has been proposed in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found no evidence of parent-specific linkage (of either <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or BMI) on chromosome 11p, a region that contains several imprinted genes, but observed weak evidence of linkage of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> to paternally derived alleles (LOD(FA) = 0.9) in the region of chromosome 6q, believed to contain an exclusively paternally expressed gene or genes that cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0008255'>transient neonatal diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we determined regions of interest on chromosomes 5, 6, and 10 where imprinted genes might be affecting the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in Pima Indians </plain></SENT>
