<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigate the relationship between HbA(1c) and the risks of vascular complications and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in such patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eleven thousand one hundred and forty patients were randomised to intensive or standard <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control in the Action in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Vascular disease</z:e>: Preterax and Diamicron Modified Release Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE) trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Glycaemic exposure was assessed as the mean of HbA(1c) measurements during follow-up and prior to the first event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adjusted risks for each HbA(1c) decile were estimated using Cox models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Possible differences in the association between HbA(1c) and risks at different levels of HbA(1c) were explored using linear spline models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a non-linear relationship between mean HbA(1c) during follow-up and the risks of macrovascular events, microvascular events and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Within the range of HbA(1c) studied (5.5-10.5%), there was evidence of 'thresholds', such that below HbA(1c) levels of 7.0% for macrovascular events and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and 6.5% for microvascular events, there was no significant change in risks (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p &gt; 0.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Above these thresholds, the risks increased significantly: every 1% higher HbA(1c) level was associated with a 38% higher risk of a macrovascular event, a 40% higher risk of a microvascular event and a 38% higher risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, HbA(1c) levels were associated with lower risks of macrovascular events and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> down to a threshold of 7.0% and microvascular events down to a threshold of 6.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence of lower risks below these levels but neither was there clear evidence of harm </plain></SENT>
