<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We transplanted islets from Wistar-Furth rats under the kidney capsule to neonatally streptozotocinised recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recipients received daily vehicle, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4495">diazoxide</z:chebi> (100 mg/kg) or the selective activator of beta cell type <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi>-ATP channels 6-chloro -3-(1-methylcyclopropyl) amino-4 H-thienol [3,2-e]-1,2,4-thiadiazine 1,1-dioxide (NN414) (3 mg/kg) intragastrically for at least 9 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Endpoint measurements were made exactly 7 days after cessation of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> did not differ between groups (mean of total: 13.2+/-1.4 mmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels were significantly depressed in drug- versus vehicle-treated rats 3 to 4 hours after the last gastric tubing event, but not at endpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Insulin responses to 27 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> from perifused grafts were not significant after vehicle (median increment 18 x 10(-3) microU.islet(-1).min(-1)) but were significant per se and versus vehicle in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4495">diazoxide</z:chebi> and NN414 groups (median 107 and 83 x 10(-3) respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rising second-phase secretion was seen only in the drug-treated groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Stimulation by 25 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi>, together with 0.5 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34795,48518">3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine</z:chebi> and 3.3 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, was enhanced in the drug-treated groups (p&lt;0.05 versus vehicle) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Graft insulin content did not differ between groups, nor did percentage of beta cells (between 67 and 68% of <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> cells) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This signal transduction defect occurs in the absence of any effect on islet macro-morphometry or insulin stores </plain></SENT>
