<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether alterations of glycolytic and oxidative enzyme capacity in skeletal muscle of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> pertain to specific muscle fibers and are associated with changes in muscle fiber composition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Vastus lateralis muscle was obtained by percutaneous biopsy from 10 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 15 age- and BMI-matched healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using cytophotometry, muscle fiber composition and fiber type-specific glycolytic and oxidative enzyme activities were measured in slow oxidative, fast oxidative glycolytic, and fast glycolytic fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the whole muscle, oxidative activity was decreased in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The slow oxidative fiber fraction was reduced by 16%, whereas the fast glycolytic fiber fraction was increased by 49% in skeletal muscle from the diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both oxidative and glycolytic enzyme activities were significantly increased in fast glycolytic and fast oxidative glycolytic fibers of type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the fiber-specific ratio of glycolytic enzyme activity relative to oxidative activity was not different between type 2 diabetic patients and the control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The myofibrillic ATP activity was significantly lower in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> fiber types of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and correlates with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion rate during the steady state of a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp and maximal aerobic capacity and negatively with HbA(1c) values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Reduced oxidative enzyme activity in muscle of type 2 diabetic patients is most likely due to a reduction in slow oxidative fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Increased glycolytic and oxidative enzyme activities in individual muscle fibers are closely related to measures of long-term glycemic control and whole-body insulin sensitivity and could therefore represent a compensatory mechanism of the muscle in function of the altered <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
