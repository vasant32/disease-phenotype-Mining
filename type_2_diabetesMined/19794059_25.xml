<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study sought to explore potential mechanisms of inflammatory-induced IR in humans with a focus on adipose tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed a 60-h endotoxemia protocol (3 ng/kg intravenous bolus) in healthy adults (n = 20, 50% male, 80% Caucasian, aged 27.3 +/- 4.8 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Before and after endotoxin, whole-blood sampling, subcutaneous adipose biopsies, and frequently sampled intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (FSIGT) testing were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was the FSIGT insulin sensitivity index (S(i)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Secondary measures included inflammatory and metabolic markers and whole-blood and adipose <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Endotoxemia induced systemic IR as demonstrated by a 35% decrease in S(i) (3.17 +/- 1.66 to 2.06 +/- 0.73 x 10(-4) [microU * ml(-1) * min(-1)], P &lt; 0.005), while there was no effect on pancreatic beta-cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In adipose, endotoxemia suppressed insulin receptor substrate-1 and markedly induced suppressor of cytokine signaling proteins (1 and 3) coincident with local activation of innate (interleukin-6, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor) and adaptive (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and CXCL10 chemokines) <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These changes are known to attenuate insulin receptor signaling in model systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate, for the first time in humans, that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> induces systemic IR following modulation of specific adipose inflammatory and insulin signaling pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It also provides a rationale for focused mechanistic studies and a model for human proof-of-concept trials of novel therapeutics targeting adipose <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in IR and related consequences in humans </plain></SENT>
