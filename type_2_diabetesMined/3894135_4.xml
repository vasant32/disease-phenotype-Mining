<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Insulin release kinetics were studied in perifused islets of Langerhans, isolated from mildly hyperglycaemic and from normoglycaemic spiny mice (Acomys cahirinus), a rodent predisposed to develop spontaneously non-ketotic <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In both groups, insulin response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (16.7 mmol/l) was delayed in comparison with that of rat islets, the release kinetics being analogous to that of human Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty min priming of the isolated Acomys islets with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (16.7 mmol/l) resulted in potentiation of the insulin release to a second stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The degree of potentiation decreased exponentially with the time interval between stimulations, showing a t1/2 of 18 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Induction of potentiation by <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was time-dependent, giving a maximal effect after 20 min of priming </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition to overall amplification of the insulin response, priming with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> accelerated markedly the initial release rates, correcting the dynamics of the response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that: (1) decreased and delayed insulin secretion is found in Acomys cahirinus before the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e>; (2) induction of time-dependent potentiation in the islet by priming with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> corrects the diabetic-type dynamics of insulin release; (3) therefore the deficient insulin release of Acomys is of a functional nature, the mechanism of potentiation bypassing the defect; (4) since insulin release in Acomys resembles that in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetic</z:e> and diabetic man, similar conclusions might apply to the islet dysfunction in Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
