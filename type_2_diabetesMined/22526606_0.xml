<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: During the development of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, beta cells are often exposed to a high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>/hyperlipidaemic environment, in which the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are elevated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In turn, ROS can trigger an apoptotic response leading to beta cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, by activating <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling cascades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we test the hypothesis that serine/threonine protein phosphatase 5 (PP5) acts to suppress proapoptotic c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signalling in beta cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ppp5c(-/-) and Ppp5c(+/+) mice were subjected to intraperitoneal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (IPGTT) or insulin tolerance tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pancreatic islets from Ppp5c(-/-) and Ppp5c(+/+) mice or MIN6 cells treated with short-interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> targeting PP5 were exposed to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> to activate MAPK signalling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Changes in protein phosphorylation, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and insulin secretion were detected by western blot analysis, quantitative RT-PCR or ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ppp5c(-/-) mice weighed less and exhibited reduced fasting glycaemia and <z:mp ids='MP_0005292'>improved glucose tolerance</z:mp> during IPGTT, but retained <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> insulin sensitivity and islet volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Comparison of MAPK signalling in islets from Ppp5c(-/-) mice and MIN6 cells revealed that the lack of PP5 was associated with enhanced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi>-induced phosphorylation of JNK and c-Jun </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cells with reduced PP5 also showed enhanced JNK phosphorylation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> after <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PP5 suppression in MIN6 cells correlated with hypersecretion of insulin in response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: PP5 deficiency in mice is associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0001262'>reduced weight</z:mp> gain, lower fasting glycaemia, and <z:mp ids='MP_0005292'>improved glucose tolerance</z:mp> during IPGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At a molecular level, PP5 helps suppress <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in beta cells by a mechanism that involves regulation of JNK phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
