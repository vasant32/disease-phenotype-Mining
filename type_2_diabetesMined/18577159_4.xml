<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the early treatment of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM), the addition of a basal insulin, such as insulin glargine, to existing oral therapy can help patients attain recommended glycaemic control targets, including <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c) (HbA(1c)) &lt;7% and fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &lt;5.5 mmol/l (&lt;100 mg/dl) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For patients close to but not at target, the management of postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excursions with a rapid-acting insulin, such as insulin glulisine, can provide further improvements in glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this review, the options for intensifying insulin therapy with the addition of one or more daily doses of prandial insulin are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, the advantages/disadvantages of choosing a basal-bolus vs. a premixed insulin strategy are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A conceptually simple approach for the treatment of T2DM is for optimization of the basal insulin dose (added to oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs) to target fasting glycaemia followed by the addition of a single prandial dose of rapid-acting insulin to target the largest <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excursion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A second and third dose of prandial insulin can then be added if HbA(1c) remains above target and to manage postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excursions at other meals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prospective studies are underway to further examine this concept and determine the benefit of this approach not only on overall glycaemic control but also on cardiovascular risk </plain></SENT>
