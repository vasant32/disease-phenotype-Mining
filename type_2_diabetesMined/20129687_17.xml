<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-six patients with impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> regulation (IGR), 55 patients with newly diagnosed and untreated type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM), and 50 subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (NGT) were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The levels of serum omentin-1 and plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> at fasting and at 2h after <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> load and fasting serum levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6, insulin, and HbA1c were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HOMA-IR was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The levels of serum omentin-1 were lower in the IGR and T2DM groups than in the NGT group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Within groups, omentin-1 levels were no significant difference before and after <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> load </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The level of serum omentin-1 was negatively correlated to BMI, HOMA-IR, fasting insulin, TNF-alpha, IL-6, plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HOMA-IR and BMI were independent related factors that influenced the levels of serum omentin-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Serum omentin-1 levels were decreased in impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> regulation subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Lack of omentin-1 may contribute to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and T2DM </plain></SENT>
