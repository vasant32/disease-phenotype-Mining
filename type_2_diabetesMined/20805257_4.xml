<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> negatively impacts the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An earlier analysis showed HRQOL to be associated with mortality, which suggests that measuring HRQOL could have clinical implications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the association between HRQOL and total and cardiovascular mortality in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during long-term follow-up and specifically focused on old age and sex differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: HRQOL was measured in a prospectively followed cohort of 1,353 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> using the RAND-36 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazard models were used to measure the independent effect of baseline HRQOL on mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 9.6 years, 570 (42%) patients died, 280 of whom died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (49%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Physical Component Score (PCS) and the Mental Component Score (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCS</z:e>) were inversely associated with total mortality, with hazard ratios of 0.988 (95% CI 0.983-0.993) and 0.990 (95% CI 0.985-0.995), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A 10-point-higher score on the PCS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCS</z:e> decreased the risk for total mortality by 11 and 10%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An inverse relationship with mortality was also seen for men, women, and for patients aged&gt;75 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mental health was significantly related to mortality in men but not in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Lower physical and mental HRQOL was associated with a higher total mortality and cardiovascular mortality in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; this is also the case when studying men and women and the elderly separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The dimension mental health, related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, was only associated with mortality in men, not in women </plain></SENT>
