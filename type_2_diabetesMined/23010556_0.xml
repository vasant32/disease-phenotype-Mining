<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the first year, average body <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> in the first 404 subjects was 1.40 kg (2.1%) in the intervention group vs 0.21 kg (0.3%) in the control group (P=0.001), and the decrease was more significant among baseline overweight women (body bass index [BMI]â‰¥24 kg/m(2)) in the intervention (2.91 kg/4.2%) compared with that in the control group (0.51 kg/0.7%) (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, women in the intervention group, compared with those in the control group, have <z:mp ids='MP_0006086'>decreased BMI</z:mp>, body fat, waist circumference, and plasma insulin levels, and have improved behaviors including increased leisure time activity and dietary fiber intake and decreased sedentary time and fat consumptions </plain></SENT>
