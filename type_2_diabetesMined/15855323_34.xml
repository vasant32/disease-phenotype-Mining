<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Observational and animal data suggest that SCD-1 activity is related to insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">insulin-sensitizing drugs</z:chebi> on SCD gene expression and desaturase activities are unknown in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover study, 24 subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and one subject with partial <z:hpo ids='HP_0009125'>lipodystrophy</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> due to dominant-negative mutation in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) gene (P467L) received placebo and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> for 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SCD gene expression in adipose tissue was determined in 23 subjects, and in a representative subgroup (n = 10) we assessed fatty acid composition in fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> to estimate SCD and delta6- and delta5-desaturase activity, using product-to-precursor indexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SCD <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression increased by 48% after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SCD and delta5-desaturase but not delta6-desaturase activity indexes were increased after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> versus placebo (P &lt; 0.01 and P &lt; 0.05, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The change in activity index but not the expression of SCD was associated with improved insulin sensitivity (r = 0.73, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the P467L PPARgamma carrier, SCD and delta5-desaturase activity indexes were exceptionally low but were restored (52- and 15-fold increases, respectively) after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study shows for the first time that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> increases SCD activity indexes and gene expression in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An increased SCD activity index may reflect increased lipogenesis and might contribute to insulin sensitization by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The restored SCD activity index after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> in PPARgamma mutation supports a pivotal role of PPARgamma function in SCD regulation </plain></SENT>
