<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesised that <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> genetic susceptibility variants might be associated with increased CHD risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined the individual and cumulative effect of 38 common genetic variants previously reported to be associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on risk of incident CHD in 20,467 participants of the European Prospective Investigation into <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> and Nutrition (EPIC) Norfolk Study who had been free of CHD at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 10.7 years, 2,190 participants had a CHD event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two individual variants next to the TSPAN8 (HR 1.07, 95% CI 1.00-1.14) and the CDKN2A/B region (1.11, 1.04-1.17) were significantly associated with increased CHD risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A genetic score based on the 38 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> variants was significantly associated with an increased risk of CHD (1.08, 1.01-1.14 per score tertile) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adjustment for prevalent and incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> attenuated the association of the TSPAN8 variant (1.06, 0.99-1.13) and the genetic score (1.05, 0.99-1.12 per score tertile) with CHD risk, but not that of the CDKN2A/B variant (1.11, 1.05-1.18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Addition of the genetic score did not improve risk discrimination based on clinical risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The increased risk of CHD observed with genetic susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was at least partly mediated by its <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-predisposing effect and was not useful for clinical risk discrimination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The potential role of pathways associated with the variant CDKN2A/B in linking <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and CHD needs further exploration </plain></SENT>
