<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is characterized by decreases in insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several classes of oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> medications are currently approved for the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A stepwise treatment approach from monotherapy to combination therapy is traditionally used; however, the frequency of treatment failure with monotherapy has resulted in a move towards earlier treatment with combination therapies that target the two principal defects in glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One such combination regimen is repaglinide (a prandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> regulator that increases insulin release) plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (an insulin sensitizer that inhibits hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> output, increases peripheral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake and utilization and minimizes <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Findings from several clinical trials have shown that combination therapy with repaglinide plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> is well tolerated and results in greater reductions of <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c) and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> values compared with either monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Repaglinide may also provide a more suitable alternative to combination therapy with sulphonylureas and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> because of its reduced propensity for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The combination regimen of repaglinide plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> should therefore be considered as a valuable option in the management of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> when monotherapy is no longer adequate </plain></SENT>
