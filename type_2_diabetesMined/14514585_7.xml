<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A two-stage study design, incorporating qualitative and quantitative components, determined the cultural equivalency and content validity of the translated scale and established the psychometric properties of the Chinese DES (C-DES) in 207 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Psychometric analysis supported the reliability and validity of the 20-item Chinese DES (C-DES-20) and five subscales: overcoming barriers (alpha = 0.89), determining suitable methods (alpha = 0.79), achieving goals (alpha = 0.78), obtaining support (alpha = 0.78), and coping (alpha = 0.76) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The test-retest reliability of the intraclass correlations was satisfactory when a subsample of 20 patients was tested after a 2-week interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was criterion validity between the global scale and metabolic control (HbA(1c)) of respondents with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The C-DES-20 is a reliable and valid outcome measure for patient education and psychosocial interventions among Hong Kong Chinese people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
