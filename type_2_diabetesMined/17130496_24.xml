<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we report that ghrelin is released from pancreatic islets to regulate <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced insulin release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasma concentrations of ghrelin, as well as insulin, were higher in pancreatic veins than in arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>GHSR <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> and immunoneutralization of endogenous ghrelin enhanced <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced insulin release from perfused pancreas, whereas exogenous ghrelin suppressed it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>GHSR <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> increased plasma insulin levels in gastrectomized and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rats to a similar extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ghrelin knockout mice displayed enhanced <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced insulin release from isolated islets, whereas islet density, size, insulin content, and insulin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were unaltered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GTTs</z:e>) in ghrelin knockout mice showed increased insulin and decreased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment with high-fat diet produced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GTTs</z:e> in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In ghrelin knockout mice, the high-fat diet-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> was largely prevented, whereas insulin responses to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GTTs</z:e> were markedly enhanced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate that ghrelin originating from pancreatic islets is a physiological regulator of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced insulin release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Antagonism of the ghrelin function can enhance insulin release to meet increased demand for insulin in high-fat diet-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and thereby normalize glycemic control, which may provide a potential therapeutic application to counteract the progression of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
