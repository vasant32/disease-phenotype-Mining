<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent data suggest that common variation in the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene is associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of such associations in independent samples provides necessary replication and a robust assessment of effect size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using four TCF7L2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; including the two most associated in the previous study), we conducted a case-control study in 2,158 type 2 diabetic subjects and 2,574 control subjects and a family-based association analysis in 388 parent-offspring trios <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> from the U.K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> SNPs showed powerful associations with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the case-control analysis, with strongest effects at rs7903146 (allele-wise relative risk 1.36 [95% CI 1.24-1.48], P = 1.3 x 10(-11)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data were consistent with a multiplicative model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The family-based analyses provided independent evidence for association at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> loci (e.g., rs4506565, 62% transmission, P = 7 x 10(-5)) with no parent-of-origin effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequency of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-associated TCF7L2 genotypes was greater in cases ascertained for positive family history and early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (rs4606565, P = 0.02); the population-attributable risk, estimated from the least-selected cases, is approximately 16% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall evidence for association for these variants (P = 4.4 x 10(-14) combining case-control and family-based analyses for rs4506565) exceeds genome-wide significance criteria and clearly establishes TCF7L2 as a type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility gene of substantial importance </plain></SENT>
