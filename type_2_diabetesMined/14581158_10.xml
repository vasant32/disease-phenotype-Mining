<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this study, the association of the Pro12Ala peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma2 (PPARgamma2) polymorphism with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was examined in a Japanese Type 2 diabetic population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PPARgamma has been identified as a key regulator of adipogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, some studies reported that the Pro12Ala polymorphism was associated with resistance to Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is well-known that Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is closely related with disorder of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism as well as impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis, resulting in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We aimed to evaluate the association between carriers of the Pro12Ala PPARgamma2 mutation and clinical profiles concerning <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> besides plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Screening for the mutation was performed using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method among 154 Type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The homozygotes of the Pro12 allele were 143 (93%), the heterozygotes of the Pro12 and Ala12 allele were 11 (7%) and the homozygote of the Ala12 allele was not detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The group with the Ala12 allele had a significantly lower value of carotid artery intima-media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) than that without it, although there was no difference between two groups in sex, age or other clinical variables we examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The Pro12Ala PPARgamma2 polymorphism may be associated with carotid artery <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> values in Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
