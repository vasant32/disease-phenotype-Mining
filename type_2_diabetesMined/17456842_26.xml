<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that ADMA predicts cardiovascular events and enhances risk prediction independent of established risk markers in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This prospective cohort study included 125 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ADMA, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi>, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP), and routine clinical parameters were determined at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>First occurrence of cardiovascular events (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass graft, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, carotid revascularization, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality) was defined as a composite end point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 21 (interquartile range 11-27) months, 84 events occurred in 48 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>According to multivariate Cox regression analysis, patients with baseline ADMA or CRP in the highest tertile had a significantly increased hazard ratio for incident cardiovascular events compared with those with ADMA or CRP in tertile 1 (2.37 [95% CI 1.05-5.35], P = 0.038, and 3.63 [1.59-8.28], P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Assessing the joint effect of ADMA and CRP revealed that patients with either ADMA or CRP or both in the highest tertile had increased hazard ratios for cardiovascular events compared with patients with neither ADMA nor CRP in the highest tertile before and after adjustment for possible confounders (hazard ratio 4.59 [95% CI 2.07-10.15], P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ADMA predicted cardiovascular events and enhanced the predictive role of CRP in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ADMA therefore could improve cardiovascular risk assessment in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
