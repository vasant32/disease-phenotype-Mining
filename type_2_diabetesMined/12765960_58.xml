<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The natural history of progression from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (NGT) to impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (IFG), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> (IGT), and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is not well defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied this progression using biennial oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests performed in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging and survival analysis to assess progression from NGT to abnormal fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG; &gt; or =6.1 mmol/l), abnormal 2-h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (2hPG; &gt; or =7.8 mmol/l), IFG (FPG 6.1-6.9 mmol/l, 2hPG &lt; or =7.8 mmol/l), and IGT (FPG &lt;6.1 mmol/l, 2hPG 7.8-11.0 mmol/l), and from IFG-IGT to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (FPG &gt; or =7.0 mmol/l or 2hPG &gt; or =11.1 mmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At baseline, the 815 subjects had a mean age of 57 years, 35% were women, and 60% had NGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 488 subjects with NGT, over half were followed for at least 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By 10 years, 14% had progressed to abnormal FPG and 48% to abnormal 2hPG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 267 subjects who progressed to IFG-IGT, 216 had additional follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By 10 years, 8% of these progressed to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by FPG whereas 27% progressed by 2hPG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In subsidiary analyses, we defined "abnormal" FPG as &gt; or =5.55 mmol/l and "diabetic" FPG as &gt; or =6.1 mmol/l, making the baseline prevalence of IFG similar to that of IGT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By these criteria, 43% progressed to abnormal FPG and 43% to abnormal 2hPG by 10 years of follow-up; among subjects developing impaired FPG or 2hPG, 22% progressed to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by FPG whereas 17% progressed by 2hPG at 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, 42% of subjects developing abnormal FPG did not develop abnormal 2hPG, and vice versa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that, although phenotypic differences in rates of progression are partly a function of diagnostic thresholds, fasting and postchallenge <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> may represent phenotypes with distinct natural histories in the evolution of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
