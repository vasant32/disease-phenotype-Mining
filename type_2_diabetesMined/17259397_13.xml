<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have investigated whether polymorphisms in this gene are associated with increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were typed in 479 type 2 diabetic patients from Boston, including 239 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD)-positive case subjects and 240 CAD-negative control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two tag SNPs (rs5029930 and rs610604) were independently associated with CAD; adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for minor allele carriers were 2.3 (95% CI 1.4-3.8, P = 0.001) and 2.0 (1.3-2.9, P = 0.0008), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The association with rs610604 was dependent on glycemic control, with ORs of 3.9 among subjects with A1C &lt; or =7.0% and 1.2 for those with A1C &gt;7.0% (P for interaction = 0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A similar interaction pattern was found among 231 CAD-positive and 332 CAD-negative type 2 diabetic patients from Italy (OR 2.2, P = 0.05 vs. OR 0.9, P = 0.63 in the low vs. high A1C strata, P for interaction = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Quantitative RT-PCR in blood mononuclear cells from 83 nondiabetic subjects showed that rs610604 and rs5029930 minor allele homozygotes have 30-45% lower levels of A20 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> than major allele homozygotes, and heterozygotes have intermediate levels (P = 0.04 and 0.028, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings point to variability in the A20/TNFAIP3 gene as a modulator of CAD risk in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This effect is mediated by allelic differences in A20 expression </plain></SENT>
