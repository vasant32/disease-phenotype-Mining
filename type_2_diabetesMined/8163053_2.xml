<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The glucokinase locus has been implicated by linkage studies in several Caucasian pedigrees with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and mutations have been identified in a large number of these pedigrees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although mutations have been reported in some pedigrees with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late onset</z:hpo> Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, linkage studies of typical familial Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> did not suggest a major role for this locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, linkage studies were consistent with the hypothesis that mutations of the glucokinase gene were responsible for the pathogenesis of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a minority of pedigrees or one gene in a polygenic disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To systematically address this hypothesis, we examined 60 diabetic members of 18 pedigrees ascertained for two or more Type 2 diabetic siblings and eight unrelated diabetic spouses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Initially, the coding regions from each of the 11 glucokinase exons were examined by the sensitive technique of single strand conformation polymorphism analysis to screen for single nucleotide substitutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, we also sequenced each exon from an affected member of the single pedigree in which a glucokinase allele was most likely to segregate with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Single strand conformation polymorphism analysis detected only three variants, none of which altered the amino acid sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No coding or splice site mutations were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Likewise, no additional mutations were detected upon direct sequence analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, additional screening of promoter and 3' untranslated regions detected a variant pattern in the untranslated region of exon 10 which appeared to segregate with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> in one pedigree.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
