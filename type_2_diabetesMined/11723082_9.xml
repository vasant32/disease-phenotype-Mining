<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of previously diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and its major risk factors among Filipino-Americans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in the Houston, Texas, metropolitan statistical area between September 1998 and March 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The convenience sample included 831 Filipino-American participants aged 20-74 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The major risk factors assessed were age, sex, family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, socioeconomic status, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (BMI &gt;30), physical inactivity, acculturation, region of birth and, in women, history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> and delivery of a baby weighing &gt; 9 lb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall prevalence was estimated to be 16.1% (95% CI 13.5-18.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression analyses identified independent risk factors: increasing age from ages 35-44 years (odds ratio [OR] 5.6, 95% CI 1.5-20.5) to 65-74 years (34.2, 7.2-163.0); male sex (1.8, 1.1-32.1); family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (4.7, 2.6-8.5); <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (3.6, 1.4-9.0); region of birth, Mindanao (3.2, 1.3-7.7); and, among women, <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> (21.7, 6.7-69.7) and low income (5.3, 1.4-20.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The study observed a high prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and supports earlier studies suggesting that Filipinos are at higher risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than the U.S. non-Hispanic white population </plain></SENT>
